00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,760
The title of my talk is htmx plus flask modern python web apps hold the javascript and it

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,880
should say on the client side this is not something that says you can't write javascript

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,120
if you want to write javascript you can htmx is a really cool technology that lets you

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,960
use a lot of the server for the exact same behaviors you would get on client side javascript

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,040
so there's a lot of people in node using this so it's not an anti javascript it's a you

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,360
can choose whatever language you're working with already I imagine many of you would like

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,240
python around here and you can choose that and you can keep working it okay so that's

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:52,600
what htmx is my keyboard doesn't work so maybe I'll just type up here or there we go so htmx

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:00,520
it's a library that allows you to do ajax like things server exchange but also css transitions

10
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,400
animations web sockets and so on it's a really cool library it's incredibly easy to use as

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,160
you'll see I don't work on htmx I'm not associated with it I'm just a big fan about how it enables

12
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,880
us as python web developers to write way cleaner code and what I'm going to show you later

13
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,080
you're going to be able to look at and say that's the whole thing that's the entire implementation

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:28,120
of it it's really really neat so one of the ideas around htmx is the howl stack this is

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,680
something that Carson Gross came up with the guy who created htmx and howl you've heard

16
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,960
of the mean stack and the lamp stack and all these various stacks well with htmx we have

17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,160
hypertext on whatever language you want you want to write python write python you want

18
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,440
to write go you write go whatever you want so you can write it however you want and I

19
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:53,520
really appeals to me I had mentioned this talk that I was coming here on Twitter and

20
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,000
someone said I'm really excited about htmx and flask it sounds great but outside it's

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,600
kind of being cleaner I mean there's really not anything different because this is what

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,560
I'm doing you see like I'm I'm writing code over here on the server and I'm getting html

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,000
from the server and I'm putting it on the page and I looked at it I said this this is

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,360
not the same thing this looks the same look at the bottom this is the htmx equivalent the entire

25
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,800
code at the bottom is the same as the top hx trigger equals key up hx get equals suggestions

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,400
hx target equals place for suggestions that's it that's the whole implementation same as above

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,720
really really neat Ryan went on earlier about how it's cool to have declarative code instead

28
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,880
of imperative code where you have to say all the steps htmx is very declarative you just say these

29
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,800
things like I want when this happens when this event happens I want this CSS transition and this

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,800
bit of code or this bit of html from the server to show up so just to get a real quick sense of

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,360
what's going on here I'm going to show you an example and I'm not a hundred percent sure on

32
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:13,680
the network here so I may want to switch over so let's see let's go to my phone because this would

33
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,200
be better on not the slow slow network that we've been suffering through all right so let's go over

34
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:29,480
to htmx and over here they've got some examples and there's all sorts of cool stuff you can do

35
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,360
you can do click to edit you can do like bulk edit you can do infinite scroll you can do progress

36
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,800
bars but let's just look at this real quick click to edit because this is a very different way of

37
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,560
thinking about web development we've thought about writing code on the server and returning

38
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,480
HTML we've thought about Vue.js or React and a bunch of stuff that just shows up on the page

39
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:56,680
and gets built up out of API's this isn't really either of those so let's let's see here so what

40
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,240
we're gonna do is we're gonna write let me just show you what it does first so down here do a

41
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:07,120
little zoom for you so we've got this non editable section of our page and we want to edit it so we

42
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,280
want to be able to do something slick like inline click to edit it and change this to you know Sam

43
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,760
or whatever and then hit save then it goes back to non editable there's no JavaScript in this page

44
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,040
that's it's really neat so what is happening how does that work on the examples they have this

45
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,120
little debug toolbar thing at the bottom notice this it says initially that part of the page

46
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,760
started out with this where it had a target what to do when the event happens to replace itself

47
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,520
with whatever it gets from the server and when you click the button where does it get the HTML

48
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,520
it gets it from there that's probably written in Python or you know whatever right for us it would

49
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,440
be written in Python and so when that runs when we click the button what did the server send back

50
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,040
it sent back the HTML that is the form and it put it right there so when I click this

51
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:04,400
htmx replaces that part of the DOM with that HTML that is a form you can even see when you

52
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,560
submit it back the details that it posts back so this is the exchange is a kind of a mind-bend

53
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,400
you've got to do here to get used to it so it's a little bit different but it is quite neat all

54
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,280
right wait for the screens to catch up all right so I encourage you to check those out we're gonna

55
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,520
write some code because writing code makes it real and what we're gonna do is we're gonna take

56
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,160
an existing web page that I built that has no interactivity on the client side whatever

57
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,280
whatsoever and we're gonna add this idea of active search that is as you type the search results come

58
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,120
out on the page rather than you type something you hit enter you see what happens right so we're

59
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,680
gonna type something up here and get some results there and we even go so far as to add browser

60
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,840
history and the ability to link back deeply into the state of the spa the front of the application

61
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:04,160
if you will all right so hopefully that sets the stage let's go write some code here don't need

62
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:11,520
this yet so first let me show you I'm not sure is running at the moment it is not so let me show

63
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,960
you here's this app that I've created for you all it's called the video collector and it it's like

64
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,480
Yahoo from the olden days where you just kind of bookmark and categorize things you like so are

65
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,480
you excited about Python well you come down here and here's some of the Python videos and we can

66
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:34,680
go watch them like let's see we'll watch this one that Hannah did at one of the this was

67
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,920
Python right so eventually shows up on on YouTube here in a place right so that's really cool and

68
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,600
there's all these different categories like there's stuff on EVs there's stuff on JavaScript

69
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:54,320
but we go up here we can also search for stuff like if I want to search for in one Apple there's

70
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,680
all the stuff that has to do with them one if I want to search for I don't know car there's all

71
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,640
the results that have to do with car but if I I don't know accidentally refresh the page I get

72
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,480
there's a warning some weird thing is about to happen to your website because I don't know you

73
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,320
were just searching for something now you you can't go there anymore and you can't bookmark it right

74
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:22,080
you definitely can't send that URL to somebody and have that mean anything right and they've

75
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,920
got to press the button so what I would like is as they type I would like that to happen so

76
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,640
let's go write that we've got 20 minutes to do it might sound like a lot of work not so much all

77
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,840
right so I'm just gonna kind of jump around a little bit this existing page this existing site

78
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,680
is here you know like I said we have 20 whole minutes to do the whole thing so we we don't

79
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,940
have too much but this page here that has the search results it has the search collector the

80
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,800
input and then it has some stuff below let me just give you the quick HTML here so up here is the

81
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:02,320
input down here is the search results section all right and then it says look if there's some search

82
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,680
text we're gonna loop over the videos and we're gonna show them there's more HTML about how they

83
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:13,640
get shown it just shows like the YouTube thumbnail and the title and stuff like that so what I want

84
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,920
to do is I want to change this so that we can use HTMX and so what you saw you saw a little bit

85
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,840
of it in those examples before what we will need to do is we need to add a few HX attributes I

86
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,160
do wish there was some kind of autocomplete for this anyone who wants to write a plug-in I would

87
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,400
love you so we're gonna go over here and we're gonna say what are we gonna do to get the search

88
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:45,480
results we're gonna do a get for videos slash search like that and one spells videos correctly

89
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,400
you're gonna have a way better chance of getting it to work thank you and then where do you want

90
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:57,760
to put the results when you get it you're gonna say HX target equals you do a CSS selector there's

91
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:05,520
a thing at the bottom down here that has an ID of search results so you just hash search results

92
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:12,360
not there you just hash search results it's gonna go into that section that's super easy and the

93
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,680
last thing is what what is gonna cause this it could be a button click it could be the page is

94
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:25,400
loaded so you got to have a trigger and the trigger is going to be a key up now this is

95
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:32,360
gonna look like it might might do what you want it's probably not gonna do what we want all right

96
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,440
let's rerun this flash should restart but let's just be safe so if I go over here again and we

97
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:46,000
go to the search and I say let's search for M1 look at this no what is happening at the bottom

98
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,480
there well I told it to give me what is that video slash search that's the whole page that's weird

99
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,880
right I don't want that that's odd so what we can do there's a couple ways we can solve this but we

100
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,880
can go over to the the complicated implementation area on the server where we're doing our Python

101
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:10,200
and we can ask a cool question we can say if this view model which sort of holds the data of the

102
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:18,680
exchange if this is an if this is an HTMX request if it is we're gonna do something different and

103
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,200
what we want to do is we just want to have a little bit of the HTML just the fragment of HTML

104
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:31,040
so we're gonna not create a notebook we are going to create an HTML page that's like a partial so

105
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:38,360
I'm gonna call this search results yeah sure it can go and get up that's fine thank you get up

106
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:46,200
and what we want is just the code that we had here which is I'm gonna collapse it so that I

107
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:53,760
can actually copy it successfully so I want that bit right there okay I'm just put it over here

108
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:03,400
and did I miss a piece something has gone wrong oh I called it Python didn't I you all didn't

109
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:15,960
even stop me HTML there we go so we're gonna return this that's the same code I just literally

110
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,840
ripped it out of there I'm gonna say if it's that I'm gonna do a little bit of work I'm gonna say

111
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:29,800
HTML equals flash dot render template and if you look over at this section it needs some videos

112
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,400
it's all the data that it needs is videos so I gotta come over here and say the template name

113
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:44,360
which is videos videos slash partial gotta love the autocomplete search results and then we got

114
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:52,280
to pass some data so videos equals video VM dot videos and then we got to return this as a

115
00:11:52,280 --> 00:12:03,440
response so return flash dot make response HTML all right let's try this again this was not

116
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,720
looking pretty I know I'm still in that we're out we're free finally so if I type in one look at

117
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:16,600
that what else should we search for HTML yeah HTML X there we go we could search for Indycard

118
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:23,800
and search for Python search for bytes all right now did you see all that flicker that was not

119
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,760
nice that's not nice at all and our server hated it I mean even though we're running an engine X

120
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:36,360
maybe be good but no wasn't good so what we can do is we can go back over here to this one in our

121
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:43,800
HTML X section and we can go for that trigger I want a few more things I want to say delay delay

122
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,560
I think it's delayed I'm gonna find out 250 milliseconds the other thing that you didn't

123
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,960
notice is if I move the arrow keys that don't make any meaningful change to the page or the

124
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,680
input it'll still do that so I can say I want to make sure the value of the text actually changes

125
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:12,600
so rerun refresh let's try this again right look at that now if I type in one you can it'll wait

126
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:21,080
oh no it doesn't I got to refresh it maybe not you know I'm guessing it's delay not delayed what

127
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:28,720
do you all think there we go all right so now we can come out yeah look at that Indy and boom

128
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:36,880
in that smooth in one and then the answers come in so let's go back and review let's review where

129
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,000
where is the server side or the client side JavaScript well that's that's what we wrote to

130
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,320
make that happen there's a lot of code running there's a lot of searches and database stuff

131
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,960
happening but it's happening on the server over here I mean there's not a lot of code right but

132
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:58,800
that's where it's happening so that's pretty cool now one more thing I would like to show you do

133
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,600
we have time oh yeah we got so much time okay so let's go over here and add one more thing because

134
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:12,880
check this out so suppose I want to search for Apple now was it m1 now is it dub dub dub DC type

135
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,440
it out the way you say it now let's go back maybe I want the one before wait it's gone where to go

136
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,120
right like there's no there's no browser history which is weird so we can actually go a little

137
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:33,520
farther and say hx-push-url equals true we refresh and wait I don't know why that is in there all

138
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:42,640
right so you go over here and let's say search for m1 can you all see that did that zoom right on look

139
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:52,280
at that search is in one now let's go to Apple let's go to Indy and now now let's go back look

140
00:14:52,280 --> 00:15:01,400
at that I still haven't written more JavaScript right five ten okay this is a super cool technology

141
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,920
it lets us write the code that we want on the server we don't have to deal with weird API

142
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,320
authorizations because you're on the server you just talk to the database you interact with your

143
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,000
APIs whatever you need to do on the server you just do it and then you get the answer right here

144
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,960
it's really fantastic so there is a problem though now that we have this what is the temptation to

145
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:27,560
paste it or share it or link to it if you have a URL and you have a web app you should probably be

146
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:33,720
able to use the URL in the web app that seems reasonable right in spas in rich JavaScript apps

147
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,000
is often called deep linking so we would like to be able to do that here as well now it turns out

148
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,320
it's actually already working but something is odd so remember when I cut this code out here I

149
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:54,600
said we're gonna go and put all this stuff over here well the reason nothing's happening is if

150
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,240
I actually put this back in that's duplicating a bunch of nasty HTML but let's just go with that

151
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,800
for a minute and I hit enter look at that now we got deep linking again pretty straightforward

152
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:13,640
pretty easy but we have this really challenging problem of linking this stuff together so then

153
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:21,200
you want to talk about ginger partials this thing that I released that allows you to create this

154
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,080
code in one place and then use it in multiple places like that it is similar but not the same

155
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,360
as there's a whole discussion at the bottom that it's not include and it is not macro it is similar

156
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,400
but not the same okay so over here at the startup of this app I've put one line of code

157
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:46,000
this ginger partials register extensions and by doing that I can then go over here and say you

158
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,440
know what that was a bad idea to put all that there what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna say

159
00:16:50,440 --> 00:17:04,120
render partial and let me just copy this so I don't make a mistake this like that and then

160
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:14,200
we got to pass the this is like a function in HTML videos equal videos and now if I rerun it to

161
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:20,800
make sure it's totally new go over here run the same code you get exactly the same output here it

162
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:28,320
is but it allows us to build up these really cool little partials and then reuse them throughout

163
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:36,240
our page so let me show you five minutes close yeah okay oh so much time okay so let me show

164
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,280
you another feature over here then I'll just walk you through it so another thing that's cool is

165
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,840
we have infinite scroll so you can come down here and we have infinite scroll for all the popular

166
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,960
videos right that's also not very much so how would you go about implementing implementing infinite

167
00:17:49,960 --> 00:18:01,440
scroll let's do that in HTML which is feed right there this this is the HTML page for infinite

168
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,320
scroll here's the title and here's a fragment of videos I got come from this video list and

169
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:15,000
then over in the video list we've got a couple of videos and if there are more videos after this

170
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,120
set after this page I'm going to do an HX get more videos the trigger is revealed replace this

171
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:29,560
little animator spin thing and that's it so this idea of render partial plus HTML allows you to

172
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:37,000
build super clean web pages and flask and avoid using a second language which happens

173
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,480
to be JavaScript as your only choice but it allows you to just stay in Python work on the

174
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:50,400
server but get something that feels like behaves for the user like some kind of front-end application

175
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:59,480
some kind of spa all right so let me just wrap that up real quick a few things wait for it to

176
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,520
all right so to trigger that remember all we had to do is set four attributes HX get HX triggers

177
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,320
key up HX target is the place it goes and then we added the history in deep linking with push URL

178
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:21,680
how do we know what to do on the server side there's actually this HX HTMX header is HX

179
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,440
header that is passed along I buried in a class so I don't have to think about it again but down

180
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,640
inside that class we just say HX requests in the headers that means it came from that's a

181
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,360
partial request you should treat it as partially otherwise it's just give me the page super easy

182
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,880
and then if you want to deep link all you got to do is handle both requests at the same URL so this

183
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:53,320
one is the partial response and this one is the deep link and it's good to go all right so I

184
00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:01,280
interviewed the creator of this framework Carson Gross on talk python when was that episode 321

185
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,320
I guess this summer so if you want to hear more from the guy who created it you can listen that

186
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,080
episode he's a really clever guy he's got a lot of interesting philosophy about how software should

187
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,200
be built and put together and stuff so definitely check that out if you're interested if you want

188
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,720
the source code from this presentation if you want that demo app you can go to talk python.fm slash

189
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:27,320
htmx there it has the that's the landing page for this course I have on htmx you can check that out

190
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,920
but as far as the source code goes right down at the top right at the top of that page you can click

191
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,360
and go over to github and see that so if you want more info talk python.fm slash htmx check that out
