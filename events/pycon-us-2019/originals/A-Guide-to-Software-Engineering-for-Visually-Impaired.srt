1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
And he will show us a guide to software engineering

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,240
for visually impaired.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,800
Please give him a warm welcome.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:13,760
Thank you, everyone.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,640
I was at PyCon last year, and it was such an amazing feeling

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,640
to meet this awesome people and listen to inspiring talks

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,800
that I decided to come again this year,

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,000
but this time as a speaker.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,800
So thank you all for coming in, listening to me

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,480
talk about a guide to software engineering for visually impaired.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,800
My name is Abraar Shaikh.

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,680
I work for Yelp as a software engineer.

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,160
Yelp's mission is to connect people

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,560
with great local businesses.

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,640
It's a search engine for finding the best business around you.

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,880
I work for the ranking platform team within Yelp,

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,900
and my team is responsible for building and maintaining

18
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,960
search infrastructure and providing search

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,320
as a platform for other application teams inside Yelp.

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,040
We leverage technologies like Apache Kafka, Apache Flink,

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,120
Elasticsearch, and use a lot of Python.

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,080
I was born with a genetic disorder called albinism,

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,560
and albinism is mainly characterized by two factors

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,960
or two things.

25
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,900
One, severe lack of pigmentation in body

26
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,640
that results in discoloration of skin and head.

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,000
And severe loss of vision that restricts my ability

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,480
to do certain daily routine tasks like driving a car

29
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,240
or using a computer.

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,520
As I was growing up, I was extremely

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,500
fascinated by computers and always

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,240
wanted to pursue a career in software engineering.

33
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,880
And with the right support of my parents,

34
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,680
I was able to achieve just that.

35
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,240
So today in my presentation, I'm going

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,240
to talk about some of my journey in software engineering.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,820
And what are some of the challenges and roadblocks

38
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,960
that I hit along the way, and I was able to overcome them.

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,320
So this is just a concise journey of my past experiences.

40
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,520
In today's presentation, we will first

41
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,400
understand what low vision really means,

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,760
how it impacts certain population sets,

43
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,680
and what effects it has on the society.

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,560
What challenges people with low vision

45
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,880
face in academia and professional environments.

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,600
And what are some of the simple strategies using which they

47
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,400
can overcome these challenges.

48
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,080
Really, my hope today is to convince you

49
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,640
all that software engineering as a profession

50
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,320
need not be that difficult even for someone with low vision.

51
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,160
This chart should be likely familiar to most of you.

52
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,720
It's called Snellen's eye chart, and this

53
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,000
is what your regular ophthalmologist would

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,840
use to measure how good your eyesight is.

55
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,840
And the metric that we are calculating here

56
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,720
is called visual acuity.

57
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,960
A visual acuity of 20 by 20 is what

58
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,920
is considered to be normal vision.

59
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,000
That's on the lower end.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,160
And the idea here is that the lower down the chart

61
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,520
you're able to read, the better your vision is supposed to be.

62
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,800
A vision of 20 by 70 or lower is what

63
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,440
can be considered as a low vision,

64
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,160
and it becomes worse if you're not

65
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:29,280
able to read anything from the top.

66
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,360
But this is not a very accurate representation

67
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,840
of what low vision really is.

68
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,960
I prefer a more functional definition of low vision,

69
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,280
because the metric of 20 by 70 might not

70
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,600
apply universally to everyone, depending

71
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,640
on what work they want to do.

72
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,720
So a better representation of low vision is really this.

73
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,640
It states that uncorrectable vision loss that interferes

74
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,160
with one's daily activities, or to put it in simple words,

75
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,160
not having enough vision to do whatever

76
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,960
it is that you need to do.

77
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,720
And this can vary from person to person.

78
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,800
For example, a visual acuity of 20 by 70

79
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,040
may be perfectly fine vision to have for someone

80
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,280
whose profession is driving, but it might not

81
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,320
be sufficient for someone whose profession is a surgeon,

82
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,800
for example.

83
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,200
So now that we have a better understanding of what

84
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,880
low vision really is, let's look at some statistical data

85
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,480
around demographics of US population,

86
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,000
specifically for people with low vision.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,040
The numbers that I'm going to present to you

88
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,520
were published by National Foundation for Blind

89
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,680
in the American Community Survey conducted in 2015.

90
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,440
About 2.3% of the total US population

91
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,000
suffers from some degree of vision loss.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,720
And this is a significantly high number, enough that all of us

93
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,200
in the tech community should be responsible for making

94
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,160
our software more accessible to everyone.

95
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,880
Let's look at some educational data.

96
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,280
Close to 25% of the total US population

97
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,640
that suffers from some degree of vision loss

98
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,720
drop out before high school, whereas the national average

99
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,400
stands at about 6%.

100
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,560
Some data on unemployment rate, around 70%

101
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,360
of the total US population that suffers

102
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,960
from some degree of vision loss were unemployed in the year

103
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,800
2015, whereas the national average stands at 5%.

104
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,160
These are some staggering numbers,

105
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,880
and they tend to depict a distinction in our population

106
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,400
sets.

107
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,720
And the reason why I believe these distinctions exist

108
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,760
are for following reasons.

109
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,240
Lack of supportive and learning environment in our classrooms.

110
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,080
Restrictive access to reading and learning material

111
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,160
for students with low vision.

112
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,040
Lack of documentation around easy access to technology

113
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,080
and lack of structure and awareness

114
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,200
around creating a more inclusive work

115
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,360
culture in our professional environments.

116
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,240
Throughout my presentation, I'll be

117
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,760
touching upon the details of each of these points

118
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,880
and try to articulate a plausible solution

119
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,120
to overcome these challenges.

120
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,400
Next, let's look at some academic challenges

121
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,840
that a student with low vision would face.

122
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,280
Our education system is centered around classroom learning,

123
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,800
and this has been the fundamental way

124
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,200
of consuming knowledge for ages now.

125
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,440
But the fundamental problem with the system

126
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,320
is that for someone with low vision,

127
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,880
even with the best optical correction

128
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,640
and the proximity to the front of the classroom,

129
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,240
it's extremely difficult for them

130
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,360
to read contents of the blackboard or the projector.

131
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,440
And all of these factors pose significant roadblocks

132
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,880
in terms of obtaining a good quality education.

133
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,920
Some of the strategies that a student with low vision

134
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,720
can apply within their classroom to overcome these challenges

135
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,280
are as follows.

136
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,520
They can seek help from the student registrar

137
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,080
or the student council within the school or university.

138
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,540
These bodies within these organized institutions

139
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,920
can help facilitate appropriate classroom accommodations,

140
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,080
and these can vary broadly based on what condition you have.

141
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,000
Some things that have worked for me in the past

142
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,200
are extra time during examinations and assignments,

143
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,960
seeking help from an assistant who can help take notes

144
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,560
during a classroom.

145
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,840
Another thing that students with low vision can do

146
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,920
is reach out to the faculty or professors for each lecture

147
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,360
and make them aware about their own condition.

148
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,460
This way, the professor can help facilitate appropriate classroom

149
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,380
accommodations, like getting these students access

150
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,900
to previous years recorded lectures

151
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:13,020
or even provide them with the lecture notes

152
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,900
before every class.

153
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,220
This way, the student is more prepared before each class,

154
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,260
and the contents within the class are more predictable,

155
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,500
and the learning experience becomes just better.

156
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,700
Something that has worked for me really well in the past

157
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,740
is use of a monocular within a classroom.

158
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,620
A monocular is a visual aid device

159
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,980
that lets people with low vision see distant far-off objects.

160
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,660
It's kind of like a binocular, but a more portable version

161
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,380
of a binocular.

162
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,020
People with low vision typically find it extremely challenging

163
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:54,020
to read contents from books and research papers, especially

164
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,900
when these materials are not available in large font

165
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,180
printable formats.

166
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:07,500
One easy solution that can overcome this challenge

167
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,900
is with the help of a magnifying glass.

168
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,780
Any magnifying glass with an optical zoom of 3x to 5x

169
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,740
should sufficiently offset the difficulty in reading.

170
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,300
However simple this sounds, this is one of the most often

171
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,140
overlooked solutions, because it usually

172
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,260
takes a lot of time and practice of getting used to.

173
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,980
Students with low vision typically

174
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,420
find it extremely challenging to get easy access

175
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,060
to the contents that are presented on a computer screen.

176
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,620
This is significantly more challenging than reading a book,

177
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,860
and the primary reason for that is

178
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,620
that the kind of content which is presented on a computer

179
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,540
screen is more dynamic in nature.

180
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,020
Just to elaborate, text that is presented on a computer screen

181
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,100
rarely follows a prescribed pattern.

182
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,940
Layout changes drastically between application

183
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,700
to application.

184
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,660
All of these factors pose a significant challenge

185
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,380
for someone with low vision to get easy access

186
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,500
to the content that is presented on the computer screen.

187
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,420
On the other hand, it's kind of hard to imagine

188
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,820
a career in software engineering without having easy access

189
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,980
to technology, and this is increasingly

190
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,820
becoming true for other professions

191
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,820
as well in this modern age.

192
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,300
Fortunately for us, early developers of operating system

193
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,020
have built accessibility as a key focus into their product.

194
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:41,380
Both Mac OS and Windows ship with great on-screen magnifiers

195
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,300
which help assist students or people with low vision

196
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,780
get easy access to the content that is presented

197
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,420
on the computer screen.

198
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,700
Just to put things in perspective,

199
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,620
I think it's really important to show you

200
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,260
what I'm talking about.

201
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,660
How does an on-screen magnifier really

202
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,700
feels like how does it feel to use it in reality?

203
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,980
So I have this web page in front of me,

204
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,020
and I know it's kind of hard to read because I've

205
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,980
reduced the resolution.

206
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,620
And this might be the first time you might actually,

207
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,740
like a speaker, has actually reduced the resolution

208
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,100
so that the audience cannot see the content,

209
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,740
but that's on purpose.

210
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,580
So yeah, now this is really hard to see.

211
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,900
This is exactly how a person with low vision

212
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,300
experiences content on the computer.

213
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,940
For example, I can tell you offhand

214
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,140
that I kind of have an idea of what the layout of this page

215
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,380
looks like.

216
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,460
There are an array of businesses as form of a list,

217
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,100
and there's an image, and then there

218
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,420
is some short description.

219
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,540
But I don't really have any sense

220
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,140
of what content is on there.

221
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,980
I cannot really name the name of the exact business that

222
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,540
is being presented here.

223
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,300
So let's start engaging with the on-screen magnifier

224
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,540
and show you how that looks like.

225
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,060
So now this is better.

226
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,580
As you can see, anything under my cursor

227
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,420
is automatically magnified.

228
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,380
That gives me a very detailed idea

229
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,900
of what that localized area of the screen looks like.

230
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,980
Just scanning through the top three results,

231
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,820
this one looks better because it has good reviews

232
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,460
and good ratings.

233
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,660
So this should be a good business.

234
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,260
So this was just to show you how someone with low vision

235
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:35,020
engages with an on-screen magnifier to use a computer.

236
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,380
If that was kind of hard to imagine,

237
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,140
if you're wondering how I was able to swiftly navigate

238
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,540
my way through the screen without actually seeing

239
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,540
the content on the screen, let me try to explain

240
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,980
that with a driving analogy.

241
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,420
Imagine you just moved to Cleveland, Ohio,

242
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,060
and you have no idea how the city layout looks like.

243
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,260
The only way you're going to get from point A to point B

244
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,780
within a city is with the help of a navigation

245
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,580
system in your car.

246
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,340
Now, a navigation system is really

247
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,180
good at giving you a very broad, high-level layout of the city.

248
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:14,460
It tells you where what is, but all the while,

249
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,900
the driver is engaging with the windshield of his car

250
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,460
to make those in-the-moment driving decisions,

251
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,220
to look around and to figure out where to take the turn,

252
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,580
at what exact time.

253
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,060
So the on-screen magnifier, which

254
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,500
is on the top half of the screen,

255
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,460
is really what is the windshield of your car.

256
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,060
Try to think of it in that way.

257
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,100
And the bottom half of the screen

258
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,900
is that navigation system.

259
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:42,020
So a person with low vision does have a clear view

260
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,780
of a very localized area of the screen

261
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,620
at any given point of time, but all the while,

262
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,700
engaging with the lower half of the screen

263
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,180
to fit that into the broader context of what's really

264
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:57,220
happening on the screen at the moment.

265
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:03,220
Next, let's understand what professional challenges exist

266
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,420
for someone with low vision.

267
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,540
Getting hired, like this is the big one.

268
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,740
When I graduated from college and started

269
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,260
interviewing for a technical role with companies,

270
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,060
one of the biggest challenge I had to fight

271
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,340
was with my own insecurities.

272
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,220
I would constantly have to go to the office

273
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,740
and get my own job done.

274
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,180
The biggest challenge I had to fight

275
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,460
was with my own insecurities.

276
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,860
I would constantly retrospect and analyze

277
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,820
my own physical limitations and conclude

278
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,220
that there is no way any company is going to hire me.

279
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,100
And I think to a small or large degree,

280
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,820
we all find ourselves in this situation.

281
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,740
The next time you find yourself in this situation,

282
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,180
I want you to remember the following.

283
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,140
All your hiring manager really cares about

284
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,260
is the answer to the following three questions

285
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,500
about the candidate.

286
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,260
Does he or she have exceptional analytical and problem-solving

287
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,100
skills?

288
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,460
Does he or she have the right leadership skills

289
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,900
to drive business value to the company?

290
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,300
And are they a strong team player?

291
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,020
However simple this sounds, in reality,

292
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,260
your physical limitation should have no correlation

293
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:17,100
to your ability to perform these job requirements.

294
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,220
At the same time, it's kind of hard to have.

295
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,380
At the same time, if you do need certain accommodations

296
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,260
as part of your hiring process, do not

297
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,620
hesitate to bring that up with the recruiter.

298
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,540
After having spoken to a lot of recruiters myself,

299
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,140
one thing I can say with confidence

300
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,220
is that your physical limitation should

301
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,420
have no impact on the hiring decision that is being made.

302
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,060
It only depends on how good of a candidate

303
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,180
you are, like what kind of skills you bring to the table.

304
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,060
But if you are a recruiter looking

305
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,340
to hire an engineer with a certain physical disability

306
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,780
or low vision to be specific, here

307
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,020
is a word of advice for you.

308
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,180
Ask the candidate if they need extra time

309
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,300
as part of the hiring process.

310
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,140
Second, and this is the most important one,

311
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,860
make sure all the interview questions are being carried,

312
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,780
all the discussions and the interview process

313
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,820
are carried out on a whiteboard or a computer

314
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,140
of the candidate's choice.

315
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,060
The second one is particularly important,

316
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,900
and I'll touch upon this briefly in the next slide.

317
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,740
Being successful in a career for someone with low vision

318
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,180
takes a lot of self-drive and self-initiator.

319
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,060
But at the same time, it's also a community effort and support.

320
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:37,060
So here are a few ways in which your peers can help you.

321
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,900
As a manager, you can help provide

322
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,700
appropriate workspace accommodations.

323
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,220
And these accommodations can change or depend

324
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,260
from person to person.

325
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,260
A few things that my manager does for me,

326
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,580
which I found extremely helpful, are he

327
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,700
ensures that I have a desk away from windows or sunlight

328
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,820
because the rightly lit environment

329
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,340
make up for a very difficult working experience

330
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,300
and extremely challenging.

331
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,740
He ensures that I have the, he ensures

332
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,340
that I have the right environment

333
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,980
and he ensures that I have access to the slide deck

334
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,780
before every team meeting.

335
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,500
This is particularly important because it's not always

336
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,340
the case that I have visual access to the contents that

337
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,860
are presented on the projector or the computer screen.

338
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,860
Next, if, for example, if you're on a team

339
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,620
and you're working on a problem with a fellow engineer who

340
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,620
suffers from low vision, for example,

341
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,500
ensure that all the discussions are carried out on a whiteboard

342
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,980
and the context around the problem

343
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,100
is shared on tickets and documents.

344
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,860
Try not to engage in pair programming.

345
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,780
And the reason for that is people with,

346
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,300
engineers with low vision have a certain way

347
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,940
of using their computers with all the accessibility features

348
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,860
turned on like the one I showed you.

349
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,460
So they're seamless in, they're seamless at their work

350
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,500
when they're particularly on their own,

351
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,140
they're doing work on their own computer,

352
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,900
but not so much when they're working

353
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,380
on someone else's computer.

354
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,620
As a tech community, we should strive

355
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,420
for consistent coding standards, have

356
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:34,460
high amount of documentation and code coverage in our code.

357
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,220
This is important other than the obvious reasons.

358
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,220
This is particularly important in the context

359
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:44,380
of this discussion is because for someone with normal vision,

360
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,180
he or she can read about 10 lines of code

361
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,700
without moving a visual muscle.

362
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,220
But for someone with low vision, they

363
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,940
can only read about three lines of code

364
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,620
in the same amount of time.

365
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,060
So that's an inefficiency of about 3x.

366
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,820
So anything that we can do to make their experience better

367
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,020
and make them more efficient is worthwhile.

368
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,260
Just to put some context and show you

369
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:16,700
what I'm talking about, this is a piece of code

370
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,940
taken from the Avro library.

371
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,460
And I know this is hard to read, but that's again on purpose.

372
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,700
So we're looking at this function.

373
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:34,260
Let's try to look at this with the normal zoom.

374
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,380
So you see, when you're looking at this function,

375
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,380
you're constantly scanning back and forth.

376
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,620
The details of this function are not important.

377
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,340
When you're looking at this piece of code,

378
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,060
you're constantly scanning back and forth

379
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,260
between those lines, trying to make sense of what's going on.

380
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,980
But remember, you have the context of,

381
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,740
so when you're looking at this function,

382
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,780
you're looking at this function as a whole.

383
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,300
But for someone with low vision, this is how it looks like.

384
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,540
When you're trying to read this code,

385
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,180
you're only scanning about three lines of code at a time.

386
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,960
So going through this function three lines at a time

387
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,380
and then back again is time consuming.

388
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,180
And the point that I'm trying to make here

389
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,780
is, if this function has a good documentation,

390
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,140
then all it takes is one linear scan of reading

391
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,940
through that documentation and trying to get

392
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,660
a sense of what's going on here.

393
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,780
So the better the documentation, the better the reading

394
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,620
experience becomes.

395
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,460
Just to recap everything that we've discussed so far,

396
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,100
here are my top three recommendations

397
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,580
for someone with low vision trying

398
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:48,420
to be successful in a career of, say, software engineering.

399
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,140
The first thing's first, gather all your tool sets.

400
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,060
And these tools can vary from person to person.

401
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,620
Some of the tools that we discussed

402
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,980
during this presentation are use of a magnifying glass

403
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,540
to get access to books and reading materials,

404
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,820
use of a monocular to get access to a classroom,

405
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,620
and use of an onscreen magnifier to get access

406
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,780
to computers and technology.

407
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,340
Now, once you have your tool set ready,

408
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,140
spend enough time and practice your skills with those tools

409
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,860
so that you become as efficient as a person with normal vision.

410
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,540
And this typically takes a long time.

411
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,700
So the sooner you start, the better.

412
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,620
The more efficient you become over time,

413
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:36,140
and the better that will be in your subsequent career.

414
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,960
Lastly, but the most important one

415
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,400
is do not hesitate to ask for help.

416
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,880
It's in your best interest to make sure your teammates are

417
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,000
aware about your condition so that they can step in and help

418
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,560
you whenever necessary.

419
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,920
Just to finish this off, I think I showed you

420
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,640
how I use the computer.

421
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,800
But I think it's important to show you

422
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,840
how I actually code, which is a slightly different experience

423
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,600
than reading stuff.

424
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,960
So for the demo, we're just going

425
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,240
to write up a simple binary search function.

426
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,200
And I want you to be focused on the top half of the screen.

427
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,400
And I know you can't read the lower half of the screen,

428
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,760
so that works.

429
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,080
So as you can see, as I'm typing along,

430
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:42,320
I'm moving the cursor with me so that I have the context of what

431
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,320
is that I'm typing.

432
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,640
This is the worst binary search ever.

433
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,560
So just a minute.

434
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,240
This is the worst binary search ever.

435
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:38,200
Sheet a little bit.

436
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:18,440
Assert if that really works.

437
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,320
Cool.

438
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:33,040
Let's see if that works.

439
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,700
Cool.

440
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,120
It works.

441
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,160
So yeah, that should give you some sense of how I use the on-screen magnifier to read

442
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,840
and write code.

443
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,800
Yeah, that's all I had for today.

444
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,120
Finally, as I said, I work for Yelp.

445
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,560
We are an awesome team.

446
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:06,800
I highly encourage you to come check out our booth on the exhibition hall.

447
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,680
Please read through our engineering blog post.

448
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,800
They are awesome.

449
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,520
We write a ton of good technical and non-technical content like this.

450
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
Thank you.

451
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:29,080
Thank you, Abra.

452
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,640
So we have time for questions.

453
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
You can find the microphones in the back.

454
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,800
Hey, thanks for your talk.

455
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,760
I was noticing that when you were using the magnifier, you had to keep scrolling the mouse

456
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,160
cursor down so you could see where you're going.

457
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,880
Would it make sense for the magnifier to follow the cursor?

458
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,400
Yes, for sure.

459
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,100
And I think I typically like such IDEs, but for the demo I was using Sublime, which doesn't

460
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,720
have that for some reason.

461
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:04,440
But IDEs like Visual Studio do that, and that's extremely helpful.

462
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
Thanks.

463
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,800
So again, thanks for your talk.

464
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,200
I noticed when you're using the magnifier, it really like blows up the text that you're

465
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,240
looking at, and it can be kind of blurry.

466
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,320
It seems like you're looking at an old school super low resolution video or something like

467
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
that.

468
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,440
So how important is it when you're developing products with accessibility in mind is the

469
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,360
overall resolution of the visuals so that you can see?

470
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,520
Is there a specific sort of density that's recommended for visually impaired users so

471
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,920
they can use the magnifier effectively?

472
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,200
Yeah, that's a great question.

473
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,320
And I think my comment on that would be this has definitely gotten better over time.

474
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,320
And I think it looks a little more pixelated now just because I've reduced the resolution

475
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,320
here.

476
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:04,160
So if I take this to the normal resolution and try to apply the zoom now, this looks

477
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,200
much better than what I showed you before.

478
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:15,360
So yes, it definitely helps to create those front end objects with high amount of pixel,

479
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,560
but yeah, I don't really have an exact number in mind.

480
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
Thank you.

481
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,160
Thank you for your talk.

482
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,360
A similar question but targeted to developers.

483
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:34,120
As a developer, what would you want to change in terms of linting or style guides that would

484
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,200
address something that would make it easier for you to read as a low vision reader?

485
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:46,320
For example, like there's a tension of the size of how descriptive a variable is versus

486
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,360
how much of your visual field it's going to take up or things like that.

487
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:57,080
I think all the standards that we've already established in PEP, which is hey, do not exceed

488
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,840
80 lines within a like 80 characters within a line, keep your function to about 10 or

489
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:09,400
12 lines, have documentation, document your arguments.

490
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:15,320
If we did follow them consistently, I think that would be a great first step.

491
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,280
On the tooling front, one package that I really recommend or tool that I really recommend

492
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:27,400
for especially Python projects is this project called precommit, which basically runs your

493
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,920
linter and fixes the code and ensures that the entire repository is in one consistent

494
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,400
style.

495
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:43,240
As long as that's taken care of, I think that is a sufficient good step.

496
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,600
Does your toolkit also include screen readers?

497
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,120
Not me specifically.

498
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:57,880
Screen readers are definitely a tool that a blind person using a computer would use.

499
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:04,720
For me, I haven't found it, like I found my efficiency to be much better just with the

500
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,280
onscreen magnifier.

501
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:13,560
But yeah, for people who have extremely bad vision, at which point the onscreen magnifier

502
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,680
is not helpful, a screen reader is definitely a good option.

503
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
Thank you.

504
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,840
Hi, I'm curious on your workflow.

505
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:33,800
Do you work with a lot of data, with charge, with some visual element?

506
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,480
Yeah.

507
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:44,040
So my workflow is typically either one of the two.

508
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:50,040
Most of my time is spent on bash shell because I'm an infrastructure engineer, I'm mostly

509
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,320
doing log analysis, looking at logs on bash.

510
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:03,240
Also spend a lot of time writing code in IDs like sublime or IntelliJ.

511
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,520
Those are the two main ones that I spend the most time on.

512
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,800
Yeah.

513
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,840
But looking at logs is difficult.

514
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,560
Yeah, I think that's a good point.

515
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:21,800
Logs is definitely difficult to scan, specifically if you're using an onscreen magnifier.

516
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,280
Just to go through all the logs is kind of hard.

517
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,720
So I usually end up writing scripts to do that work for me so that I'm only looking

518
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,760
at subset of the logs or looking at those logs in Splunk.

519
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,240
If a normal engineer is just making sense of logs, just by looking at the raw logs,

520
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,800
I typically take that extra effort to load it into Splunk so that I have a better visualization

521
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,920
and I'm not missing any tiny details.

522
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:55,600
Second question, I'm curious on any particular elements that are difficult for your magnifying

523
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,840
class to work with.

524
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,880
For example, does your magnifying class work with a pop-up tool where you hover your mouse

525
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,400
over and then the pop-up was way over another size?

526
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
For sure.

527
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Everywhere.

528
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,720
That's a feature I've given up on.

529
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,560
Stuff like Amazon, right?

00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,120
You hover over a product and it gives you this pop-up.

531
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:24,000
I can never get to the pop-up because by the time I move to the pop-up, it's gone.

532
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,600
In circumstances where I know that there is no alternative way of reading to get rid of

533
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,660
the pop-up, there is another version of this onscreen magnifier which lets you magnify

534
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:43,420
the entire screen and not just the one specific segment of the screen.

535
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:47,140
So that variation of the onscreen magnifier really helps with the pop-up.

536
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,620
Okay, thanks again, Abrah.

537
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,620
Please give him another round of applause.
