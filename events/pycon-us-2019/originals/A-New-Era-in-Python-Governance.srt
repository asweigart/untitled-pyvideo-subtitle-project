1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Thank you so much.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hi, everyone.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,240
My name is Shawna Gordon-McKeon.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,000
I am a Python programmer.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,080
I've got a background in a bunch of different things including social psychology, community

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,400
building and governance.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,680
And I have to start this off by saying that I was not at all a part of Python's recent

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,400
governance changes, nor do I have any experience in the governance of Python itself, but I'm

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,120
really interested in the topic of governance in general.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,200
And I asked around to see if anyone was going to be presenting on this at PyCon, and the

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
answer was no.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,880
And I was like, well, someone should present on this at PyCon.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,080
And here I am.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,400
So why do I think this is such an important topic?

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,480
Well, I saw this tweet recently.

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,520
And I really love it.

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,640
Because I have spent many years as part of this Python community without really thinking

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,640
about how things run.

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,640
And I was just like, oh, Gito's the BDFL.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,200
The PSF exists.

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,920
Things seem to be going fine.

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,200
And sometimes it takes a kid's relentless curiosity to go ahead and actually ask, wait, what is

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
a BDFL?

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
What does it mean?

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,800
How does the PSF run?

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,480
What other roles even exist?

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,400
And how do people get into those roles?

29
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,520
Another thing that can get us asking questions like that is a big conflict or shakeup.

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,000
And I think that's what happened to a lot of folks last year when Gito announced that

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,560
he was going to be stepping down as the BDFL.

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,920
So this talk is meant to try and answer some of these questions.

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,200
And it's going to be roughly chronological.

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,200
I'm going to start by talking about how Python used to run.

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,560
Then we'll go into what changed.

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,240
And then finally, we'll talk a little bit about how things work now.

37
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,960
So let's get to it.

38
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
So I made this chart.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,280
I'm not a professional chart designer, so my apologies.

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,000
But I made this chart to help myself understand all of the different elements of the Python

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,400
community holistically.

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,520
So this represents how things used to be about a year ago.

43
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,780
So one of the first things that may leap out to you is that the Python Software Foundation

44
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:14,120
and the Python language are two distinct groups with two distinct governance processes.

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,920
And this is something I did not understand myself, despite having been involved in Python

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,840
and coming to Python for close to a decade.

47
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,160
I think part of why this has been a little confusing for people is that historically

48
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
Gito has been the leader of both groups.

49
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,080
So even though they're technically separate, they're sort of like united in their leadership.

50
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,040
So people assume that they're more legally entangled than they are.

51
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,760
So which group does what?

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,800
Well, the PSF manages the intellectual property of Python.

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,720
And they're also responsible for a lot of community building and community management.

54
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,560
For instance, they run PyCon, and they do a great job with it.

55
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,400
They also sponsor other conferences and meetups, run diversity initiatives and more.

56
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,640
Whereas the Python language is focused on developing CPython.

57
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,640
So I'm going to focus mostly on the Python language, but I did want to take a moment

58
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,960
to talk about how the PSF runs, because after all, it's an important part of our community,

59
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
too.

60
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:18,600
The PSF is a 501c3 nonprofit, and all nonprofits have a board of directors who govern the project.

61
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,280
Now most nonprofits have what's called self-perpetuating boards of directors, which mean the boards

62
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,640
appoint new directors themselves.

63
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,520
They do have a legal responsibility as a nonprofit, but to be frank, a lot of boards decline into

64
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,480
irrelevance and mismanagement because there's not a ton of accountability because they're

65
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,280
self-perpetuating.

66
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,640
I could do a whole talk on some of the problems with self-perpetuating boards, but I won't

67
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,920
because I am pleased to say that the PSF is a member-elected board, which means that PSF

68
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,320
members elect their own leadership.

69
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,880
And so because the PSF is member-elected, let's take a second to talk about how that

70
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,960
membership works.

71
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,880
So there's five kinds of members.

72
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,480
There's basic members, and anyone who wants to can become a basic member.

73
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,080
All you have to do is agree to follow the code of conduct.

74
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,480
However, basic members are the only kind of PSF members who can't vote.

75
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,880
There are four kinds of voting members contributing, supporting, managing, and there's also something

76
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,640
called a Python fellow.

77
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,080
And so you can become this kind of member through donating, through contributing in

78
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,400
a variety of different ways, or being selected or nominated and then elected by existing

79
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,720
fellow members to be a PSF fellow.

80
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,960
And so those latter four kinds of members are voting members.

81
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,120
And I think limiting voting to people who have contributed to the community in some

82
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,520
concrete way is a useful way to make sure that the people who are voting on leadership

83
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,080
have a real stake in the community.

84
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,680
And the PSF actually does some other interesting things regarding voting, like they require

85
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,240
people to declare their intention to vote at the beginning of the year.

86
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,760
And in order to keep your voting eligibility for the length of the year, you can't miss,

87
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,920
I think, more than four votes in a row.

88
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,200
And again, this rewards participation and encourages sustained engagement so that the

89
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,880
people who are making decisions at any given time are the ones who have been engaged with

90
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,000
the community in a sustained way, which I think is really great and interesting.

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But enough about the PSF.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,680
Let's go back to Python the language.

93
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,440
So it's with the Python language team that we get the idea of Guido as a benevolent dictator

94
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,800
for life, because as I just stressed, there is never a way in which he was a dictator

95
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,920
of the PSF because member-elected nonprofits simply can't have dictators benevolent or

96
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,160
otherwise.

97
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,520
So instead, he was the BDFL of the language side of things.

98
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,520
So what does it mean to be the BDFL?

99
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,320
In theory, it means that you're in charge of everything.

100
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,720
But Python's a big, big project with a lot going on.

101
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,840
And so really, there's a whole group of people who are involved in the day-to-day work of

102
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,720
And that is the Python core team and the sort of Python contributors who are a wider group

103
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,960
of people of whom the core team is a subset.

104
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,600
And so these are the people who are doing the work of creating Python, making decisions,

105
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,120
and it's when there's a conflict or a high-level design decision that Guido would step in and

106
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,520
have the sort of ultimate say.

107
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,960
And practically speaking, a lot of how this authority got exercised is through deciding

108
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,360
which PEPs got accepted or rejected.

109
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,280
So sidebar, what's a PEP?

110
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,480
So PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, and it's how the community makes decisions

111
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,640
about language, designs, standards, and processes.

112
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,560
The most well-known of these is probably PEP 8.

113
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,080
Who here has heard of PEP 8?

114
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,120
Yeah, almost everyone.

115
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,800
So that's the one that lays out the style guide for Python, but there's actually several

116
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,080
hundred PEPs out there.

117
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,520
PEP 1 goes into great detail about what PEPs are and how they're decided on, but I'll give

118
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,920
you the TLDR here.

119
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,340
So first off, someone authors a PEP.

120
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,240
If that person who's authoring the PEP is on the core team, they can just directly submit

121
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,320
the PEP.

122
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,400
If you are not on the core team, you have to get a core team member to sponsor your

123
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,880
PEP.

124
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,040
And there's a period of debate where people talk about it, discuss it, give feedback,

125
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,840
and there's a specific person who is given sort of a managership of that PEP who can

126
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,860
kind of say, okay, I think we're ready to vote on it, or I think it needs more work.

127
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,720
And sometimes, historically, this was Guido.

128
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,420
Sometimes it was the BDFL delegate, so the idea being that Guido was delegating his authority

129
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:51,960
as the decision maker to someone who is better, more experienced in that area can make a better

130
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
decision.

131
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,820
Sometimes Guido asked them to take the role, sometimes they self-nominated, but it's my

132
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,460
understanding that there was little to no conflict ever around who took that BDFL delegate

133
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,180
role.

134
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:10,580
So in the end, Guido or the BDFL delegate would rule that the PEP was accepted or rejected,

135
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:16,340
or one of a couple of other less common end states that a PEP could end in.

136
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,380
So to come back to our chart of how things used to be, you can see that we've got this

137
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:25,440
group of contributors, the group of core developers who sort of manage the contribution process,

138
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,020
and then the BDFL who can sort of step in when there's conflict and say, this is how

139
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,020
we're doing things.

140
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,240
So it's a system that worked for us for many years, but it's not our system anymore.

141
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,400
So what happened?

142
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,340
So there was a PEP, 572.

143
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,120
There's a talk on that PEP that happened the other day by Dustin Ingram, if you're interested

144
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,480
in learning more about it.

145
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,400
For our purposes, it really doesn't matter what the content of the PEP was.

146
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:55,840
What matters is that it was a heated discussion, highly controversial, very stressful for the

147
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,520
people involved.

148
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,240
And at the end of it, as you heard Guido say this morning if you went to the steering council

149
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,060
keynote, left him with a feeling that he just didn't want to be BDFL anymore.

150
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,460
So he sent out an email saying essentially, I resign, you figure out what you want to

151
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,820
do next.

152
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,120
So Python was faced with this question, who's in charge now?

153
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,660
So they could have just selected another BDFL, but there's no one obvious person with the

154
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,940
sort of trust or legitimacy or history to just step into that role.

155
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,700
So really, before they could tackle the who's in charge question, they were faced with the

156
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,780
question, well, what is our governance model even going to be?

157
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,180
But they didn't really have any way to decide that either because Guido had always just

158
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,600
been the BDFL and he didn't want to unilaterally pick the new governance method.

159
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,860
He wanted the community to make a decision.

160
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,000
So really, before they could tackle what our governance model is going to be, they were

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,020
faced with the question, how do we decide what our governance model is going to be?

162
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,260
So three distinct layers of decision making happening here.

163
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,460
And it's important for all communities that are making these kinds of governance decisions

164
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,500
multiple levels which have to be tackled separately.

165
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,580
So I like to use the United States as an example because I am from the United States and therefore

166
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,780
I am intimately familiar with it.

167
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,500
So how did the United States government or the community people who became the United

168
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,700
States answer these questions?

169
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,940
Well, they started off with the question, how do we decide what our governance model

170
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,640
is going to be?

171
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,900
And they decided they were going to have a constitutional convention in Philadelphia

172
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,180
and they were going to come up with a model that was going to be ratified by the states.

173
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,620
Actually, that's a little bit of a lie.

174
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,500
A lot of people came to that convention thinking they were going to be fixing the Articles

175
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,580
of Confederation and when they got there, it was like, surprise, we want to do a whole

176
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,300
new constitution.

177
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,300
But that's the sort of venue in which they made that decision.

178
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,060
What is our governance model going to be?

179
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,260
That was the actual US Constitution.

180
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,340
And then the question of who's going to be in charge is the first president, the first

181
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,580
Congress, the first judiciary system.

182
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,340
And as you can see, these needed to happen in a specific order and time.

183
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,540
You can't get the George Washington as the president before you have a president and

184
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,300
you can't know that you're going to have a president until you decide how you're going

185
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,980
to decide whether or not you want a president.

186
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,780
So back to Python.

187
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,420
So let's start with that first fundamental question.

188
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,940
How do we decide what our governance model is going to be?

189
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:23,260
So there are several months of intense online and in-person conversations about this.

190
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:28,140
In September of 2018, there was an in-person meeting of the core team in Redmond and those

191
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,900
who couldn't make it in person joined remotely.

192
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:35,220
There was a lot of discussion on the threads and discuss.python.org.

193
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,940
But eventually they consensed around an answer which was laid out in PEP 8001.

194
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:45,200
And the short version is that people could submit proposals for new governance models

195
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,300
in the form of PEPs and that after a period in time, the community was going to vote on

196
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,100
which one to choose.

197
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,540
So who got to propose?

198
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,860
Well, it was through submitting at PEP.

199
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,620
So the answer is core developers or someone who could get a core developer sponsor.

200
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,300
But practically it was just core developers who submitted proposals.

201
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
Who got to vote?

202
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:10,820
So the PEP says active core developers could vote and it was a bit of an honor system there.

203
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,140
The PEP says we are asking core developers to self-select based on whether the governance

204
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,900
situation will affect them directly.

205
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,820
And I think it's a really good idea.

206
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,820
There's a lot of research that says that communities function best when the people most

207
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,460
impacted by a decision have the primary say in making that decision.

208
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,820
And if you want to learn more about that sort of research background, I gave a talk at Libre

209
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,260
Planet back in March which I've got a link to at the end of my slides which goes into

210
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,580
some of the research that leads us to believe that statements like the one I just baldly

211
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,640
made are true.

212
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,740
So the final thing that PEP 8001 lays out is how the vote works.

213
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,900
There was a whole discussion thread before this about what voting method would be best.

214
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,940
I won't go into it here.

215
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,740
But there's a long thread about it on discuss.python.org if you're a voting methods nerd.

216
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,340
The end result was I chose a condorsant method of voting which is a form of ranked voting

217
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:14,580
which is believed to be a better way of getting consensus than the sort of majority first

218
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,900
past the post system that we're used to.

219
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,460
That I am used to in the U.S.

220
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,660
And it was administered by the PSF in the person of Ernest W. Durbin III also our PyCon

221
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,340
chair who is the PSF's director of infrastructure.

222
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,380
And again I think this was a great idea, a good way to take advantage of the fact that

223
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:40,740
the PSF exists as a relatively neutral third party.

224
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:46,320
So we've got PEP 8001 is the equivalent of the Constitutional Convention and ratification

225
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
of the states.

226
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,320
So let's move on to what the actual governance model is.

227
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:58,280
So they started out this discussion by doing a survey which is in PEP 8002, the open source

228
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,640
governance survey.

229
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:05,800
They researched the governance of Rust, OpenStack, Jupiter, Django, TypeScript, AstroPy and Microsoft.

230
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,600
And this document is a great resource far beyond the Python community itself because

231
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,400
it gives a series of case studies about how other projects have made these kinds of decisions.

232
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,760
So I wanted to give a shout out to the five authors of this PEP.

233
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,360
Barry Warsaw, Lucas Langa, Antoine Petrou, Doug Hellman and Carol Willing.

234
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,720
Thank you for doing this work which I think will benefit all of us.

235
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,960
And I actually am using this to start off a new project, hopefully it will remain a

236
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:38,700
minor project, which is just collecting case studies of governance in open communities.

237
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,120
So if you're interested in that I will be linking to that at the end of the talk as well.

238
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,840
So here are some of the specific models that ended up getting introduced.

239
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,360
I will go through this pretty quickly because after all we only ended up using one of them.

240
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,400
But there's some interesting options in here.

241
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:02,560
So there's the technical leader model which is an elected BDFL, so really a BDFN, benevolent

242
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:09,080
dictator for now, or it was meant to be for every three releases, so BDF3R?

243
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,860
I don't know, I don't know.

244
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,220
It loses a little bit of its punch.

245
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,060
And they would be helped by a council of people who would all be core devs.

246
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,620
There's the trio of Pythonistas model.

247
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,340
And what I thought was interesting about this one is that everyone had to run as slates,

248
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,500
which would ensure, hopefully ensure that the people who were elected worked well together

249
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,420
because they were running together.

250
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,140
Yeah.

251
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,060
The community governance model, which is one of my favorites, expands on the idea of the

252
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,500
experts index.

253
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,420
So for those of you who don't know, there's an existing thing called the experts index

254
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,500
which is a way to keep track of which members of the contributor community have expertise

255
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,780
in given areas of Python, and you can use that to get feedback on potential peps that

256
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,900
impact those areas.

257
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:55,600
So the community governance model would have taken that and said the people who are listed

258
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,660
as experts are the ones who decide on the peps in those areas with the ability of the

259
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,300
core devs to get together and overrule a specific decision if they were like, no, that expert

260
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,820
made a bad decision.

261
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,100
There is the external council governance model.

262
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,780
The most interesting thing about this one is that people could not be core devs.

263
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:23,420
So the goal here is to put power in the hands of a neutral third party, which is an interesting

264
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,420
goal.

265
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:29,140
It's definitely the only one of these proposals that really is trying to take power away from

266
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,140
the core devs.

267
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,100
So interesting.

268
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,140
There is the common slash anarchist governance model.

269
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,220
So the title of this proposal is the commons governance model.

270
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,900
But the author says that they used commons instead of anarchist as a phrase because anarchist

271
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,140
has negative connotations.

272
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,020
But the pedantic person in me who studies commons governance is like, no, commons governance

273
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,700
and anarchist governance are separate things.

274
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,540
So I just did a little bit of editorializing and crossed out the commons and put the anarchist

275
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,340
back.

276
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,820
And my understanding of this proposal is it has a sort of council of elders who make a

277
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,700
lot of context based decisions about whether a PEP should be voted on or whether there's

278
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,700
already consensus.

279
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,140
I'll be honest, I don't really fully understand this one.

280
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,580
There's the steering committee model, which has a three member committee who make high

281
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,380
level design decisions but do not decide on PEPs.

282
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,300
They're not allowed to decide on PEPs.

283
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,540
Instead they can either select a PEP delegate or hold a vote of all of the core team.

284
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,160
And finally, there's the steering council model, which is a five member committee elected

285
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,700
for the length of a release.

286
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,620
They can make decisions about PEPs, but the proposal, the language they use says, please

287
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,860
don't try to delegate responsibility as much as possible.

288
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,940
Only step in when you really have to and try instead to make decisions that will enable

289
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:51,460
other people to do it instead of making one off decisions yourself.

290
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,700
So these were all discussed online before the vote happened.

291
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,060
And you can see the debate there.

292
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,060
It's really interesting.

293
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,940
Victor Stinner, I hope I'm pronouncing his name correctly, did a nice comparison of the

294
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,940
proposals.

295
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,340
I've got it linked at the end of my slides and talked about some of the different ways

296
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,780
in which these proposals differ.

297
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,340
So some of them distributed versus centralized power, the number of people in leadership

298
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,940
roles, the importance of being a core dev.

299
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,500
One of the proposals was like, no, you can't be a core dev.

300
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,380
Other proposals were like, you have to be a core dev.

301
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,820
How PEPs are handled, how leadership that people don't have confidence in any longer

302
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,700
is handled.

303
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,140
Other things that people considered were how much burden was a particular process going

304
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,980
to put on the core devs, many of whom are unpaid volunteers.

305
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,340
And another interesting thing was some people were arguing that formally implicit processes

306
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:44,620
should be made explicit while other people were saying, no, let's leave things informal

307
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,020
and only make them explicit once we have to.

308
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,220
So finally, they held the actual vote.

309
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
You can see it yourself at the civics website.

310
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,580
Again, linked at the end of my talk.

311
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,580
The winner was PEP 8016, aka the steering council model.

312
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,060
We'll go into that in just a minute.

313
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,180
But first, I want to update my little chart here.

314
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:09,900
So the steering council model is our sort of constitutional equivalent to the U.S. Constitution,

315
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,580
which leaves us with the final question of who is in charge now.

316
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:19,580
So the PEP proposal specifies how people become part of the steering council, which is through

317
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,580
elections.

318
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,820
So this January, elections were held again in the PSF, again administered by Ernest W.

319
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,100
Durbin III.

320
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,020
And the first steering council was elected, Barry Warsaw, Brett Cannon, Carol Woolling,

321
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,340
Guido Van Rossum, and Nick Coughlin.

322
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:38,860
And many of you probably saw them today earlier at the keynote.

323
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:44,060
And this election is documented in PEP 8100 because everything's a PEP.

324
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,900
All right.

325
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:51,580
So we've got our people down here, the equivalent of George Washington and the all-important

326
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,860
judicial and legislative branches as well.

327
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,860
Can't forget them.

328
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,620
Balances of power.

329
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,460
Theoretical balances of power.

330
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,380
So this is how we got where we are.

331
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,780
But okay, where are we now?

332
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,620
So you can see on this chart, we've replaced our BDFL with a steering council.

333
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,260
But it's not quite as simple as a one-for-one replacement because where Guido was in a fairly

334
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,900
clear position of authority over the core team, the steering council is in a more equal

335
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,900
role.

336
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,660
So let's get into a little bit of detail about how actually the core team and the steering

337
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,220
council relate to each other.

338
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,620
These are all taken from PEP 13, which is the PEP that describes the current constitution

339
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,620
slash governance.

340
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,100
So the core team is very similar to the existing core team previously.

341
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:42,020
Membership is granted by receiving a two-thirds positive vote from the existing core team

342
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,760
and no veto by the steering council.

343
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,960
So the steering council now has a veto over membership.

344
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,560
There's no time limit on being a core team member.

345
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,480
Once you join, you can stay.

346
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,160
But people who haven't made contributions in a while can be made inactive and temporarily

347
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,120
lose their voting privileges until they become active again.

348
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,720
The steering council is five people.

349
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,400
They make decisions via a majority vote of non-obstaining members.

350
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,960
They're nominated by the core team and they're elected by the core team.

351
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,360
No more than two people who are employed by the same company can serve on the council

352
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:21,240
at the same time, just to avoid the sense that the steering council is biased towards

353
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,800
any one particular company or employer.

354
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,720
The core team has authority over the Python project infrastructure.

355
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:34,360
Hold on a second.

356
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,840
They have authority over the Python project infrastructure, like the project website,

357
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,440
the GitHub repositories, bug tracker, mailing list, etc.

358
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,880
And they have the responsibility of electing the steering council.

359
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,040
The steering council has the mandate of assuring the reliability and stability of the Python

360
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,580
language, making contributing accessible and sustainable and diverse.

361
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,800
They help liaise with the PSF.

362
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,120
And they're tasked, especially now at this beginning part, with establishing decision-making

363
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,280
processes and resolving controversial decisions.

364
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,080
The steering council is explicitly given the right to accept or reject PEPs and enforce

365
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
the code of conduct.

366
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,600
But as I said before, the proposal specifically stresses that they should try to do as little

367
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,480
of that as possible.

368
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,400
So the proposal says instead of voting, it's better to seek consensus.

369
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,240
Instead of ruling on individual PEPs, it's better to define a standard process for PEP

370
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,560
decision-making.

371
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,920
It's better to establish a code of conduct committee than to rule on individual cases

372
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,520
and so on.

373
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,920
So both the core team and the steering council have recourse if members of the other group

374
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,040
are causing problems.

375
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,160
The core team can have a vote of no confidence.

376
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,440
In individual steering council members or in the council as a whole, that has to happen

377
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,640
via a two-thirds majority.

378
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,440
If the council as a whole is removed, there's an immediate election to create a new council.

379
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,400
And similarly, the steering council can vote to reject members of the core team, again

380
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,700
requiring a two-thirds majority.

381
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,200
But obviously the hope is that none of this will be necessary.

382
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,640
So as you can see, there's a sort of balance of power between these two groups.

383
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,360
That said, PEP 13 outlines how PEP 13 itself can be changed, which is by a two-thirds vote

384
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
of the core team.

385
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,160
So the fundamental authority here is still with the core team.

386
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Because if enough of them believe that the governance process needs to be altered, then

387
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,500
they're the ones who can do it.

388
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,680
And if the steering council wants to alter things, they have to convince the core team

389
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,840
to do it.

390
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,520
So that is our current governance system.

391
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,600
So going forward, what's going to change?

392
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,040
Now, unless you're already a Python contributor or a member of the core team, probably not

393
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,720
that much is going to change from your perspective.

394
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,760
But that being said, the governance transition is still happening.

395
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:59,640
The steering council has been tasked with figuring out the details of the transition,

396
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,680
figuring out which of the previous processes that worked with the BDFL may no longer work

397
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,520
and may need to be changed.

398
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,640
So there may be some more visible changes coming on down the line.

399
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,680
And if you're interested in the work that the steering council is doing, you can take

400
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:21,160
a look at the keynote from this morning and also engage with them in various other ways.

401
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,720
If you want to get involved in this, the best way to start is to start by contributing to

402
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,240
Python.

403
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,120
As I've talked about, leadership is drawn from and accountable to the community of active

404
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,120
contributors.

405
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,400
So becoming a contributor is your first step towards participating in leadership.

406
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,800
And there's some great resources for getting more involved.

407
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:47,320
There's a very detailed contributing guide at devguide.python.org.

408
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,320
And I've linked to that again at the end of the talk.

409
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,120
Python also has a core mentors program.

410
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,080
So if you're serious about this, you can get matched up with an individual mentor who will

411
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,080
personally work with you to help you contribute.

412
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,960
And again, I've linked to that at the end of the slide.

413
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,280
You should just assume if I mentioned something, I've linked it at the end of the slides.

414
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,680
And if you're more interested in the community side of things, there's many great volunteer

415
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,080
opportunities with the PSF.

416
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,000
So I want to take a moment to talk about the lessons of the Python project for Python projects

417
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
as a whole.

418
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,480
Because I think this is really relevant lessons here.

419
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,000
So many projects have only informal governance systems.

420
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,440
And it's important to stress here that all projects have some kind of governance system.

421
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,080
Just because it's entirely at the whim of a single person doesn't mean that that's not

422
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,080
a governance process.

423
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,560
It's just a really informal and spontaneous and implicit governance process.

424
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,600
And many projects start with a single person.

425
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,400
And as the project goes, that founder sort of just by default retains their authority.

426
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,680
And when governance is formalized, it's often, though not always, codified into this BDFL

427
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
model.

428
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,040
So the path that Python and Guido took is really very common.

429
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,400
A number of projects have sort of a partial formalization of their governance.

430
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,240
They'll specify who's in charge, but not necessarily how we change our governance model.

431
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,120
So that foundational level of decision making.

432
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,600
So when they do have to change, either because someone retires or flakes out or moves on

433
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,600
or is abusive or just for whatever reason that their current governance system isn't

434
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,560
working, they're at a loss for how to change it.

435
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,280
And there's a bit of a tension here.

436
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,920
Because I know that for many people, if you're trying to build in explicit governance processes

437
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,160
it can be seen as adding unnecessary bureaucracy to the project.

438
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,360
But the alternative is often worse.

439
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,200
Because many projects discover the need for governance processes only once there's an

440
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,360
active conflict in the community.

441
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,160
And when that happens, the people involved are already deeply invested and have chosen

442
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,600
sides in that conflict.

443
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,480
And it's a much rougher place to be making governance decisions from.

444
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,560
Because you have to make all of these complicated choices from positions of mistrust.

445
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,400
And the different levels of decision making get entangled.

446
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,040
Because you want a specific person to be in charge because you know that they're on your

447
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,920
side on whatever the specific conflict is.

448
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,440
And it's hard to separate making the decision about making the decision from that person

449
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,440
you want to end up with.

450
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,440
So it's not a great place to end up.

451
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,480
So my recommendation for projects is to get that first level of decision making done.

452
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,560
How to decide how we're going to decide step.

453
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,360
And it doesn't have to change anything about the experience of participating or who the

454
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,680
leader of the project is.

455
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,480
Because you're not saying anything about who's going to govern or even how they're going

456
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,520
to govern.

457
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,080
Just how you're going to decide how they're going to govern.

458
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,120
So you can keep your BDFL, but just spell out if you were going to change away from

459
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,560
a BDFL model, how are you going to make that decision?

460
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,920
So for Python that would have been the equivalent of already having PEP 8001 before we had a

461
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
shutdown.

462
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,760
And your version of PEP 8001 might not look like PEP 8001 and probably won't, but it should

463
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,880
cover how the decision about what happens next will be made.

464
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,880
Is it going to be vote, consensus, what type of vote, majority versus supermajority, and

465
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,880
also who is going to get to make it.

466
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,640
Who can propose options and who can decide on the outcome.

467
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,520
And then finally another lesson to take from Python.

468
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,960
When you're changing the governance of an existing system, think about what resources

469
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,040
already exist.

470
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,400
The Python language team made extensive use of existing PEP processes of the core dev

471
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,640
team and of the PSF.

472
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,880
And I think the results would have seemed less legitimate if they hadn't done that.

473
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
So that's the end of my talk.

474
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,600
I think I have a few more minutes.

475
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,200
Do I have any time?

476
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
I have about a minute.

477
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,160
So I'll take questions outside in the hallway track.

478
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,760
But I just want to give a brief thank you to Carol Willing and Brett Cannon for answering

479
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,680
some of my questions before I give this talk.

480
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,440
I did not egregiously misrepresent anything.

481
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,440
There's a whole bunch of links here for some of the things that I've mentioned.

482
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,640
I have a talk on Libre Planet from Libre Planet back in March that talks about governance

483
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,480
from a more abstract perspective, talks about Python and a few other different projects.

484
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,720
And if you're interested in nerding out with me about governance, please come find me because

485
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,720
I'm a little bit obsessed.

486
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
All right.

487
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
Thank you so much, everyone.
