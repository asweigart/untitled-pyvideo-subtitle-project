1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, so once more, good morning.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Just like the introduction, so much has been discussed here,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and I'm really overwhelmed the way Python has actually gone.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The last time I attended the PyCon was in 2012 at Silicon Valley,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and within that six or seven years, so much has actually happened.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So I'm going to say what we are trying to do,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
because all these nice things, some people are not going to benefit from them.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Like Meg said this morning, he said we need to be able to empower everybody,

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to be able to shied adults from all diverse culture and geographical background

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
with data structure and see what the problem they can solve.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is quite interesting, and as I go on this talk,

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
you are going to see that there was an effort to do so in the past, but it didn't succeed.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So my talk is on how this particular using QPython smartphone will help us in accomplishing that.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So first I would just thank the Education Summit Committee for accepting my abstracts.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Then I thank the organizers of PyCon, then the PyTorne Software Foundation for the invitation,

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and of course the funding, because without it I wouldn't be here now.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I have been an active member of the PyTorne community,

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and as I said I was at PyCon 2012 at Silicon Valley, and my talks are there.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The first thing I want to say is why computational approaches.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't need to explain that to an audience like this,

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
because it is now established today that we need computational physics.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Why in developing what? Computational physics is restricted to maybe university programs.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Here I hear that high-grade already taking computational physics and learning programming.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This is overwhelming.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But there is one aspect I want to add.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm not going to go into the details of why we need computational physics and all that,

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
but there is an aspect that is really motivating me here.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Today in research what we do is that we have so many numerical software for solving diverse problems.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
My area, I'm a condensed matter physicist, so I work on a strongly correlated system.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
In that place we have all kinds of software today,

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and from solving things like density, fortunate theory, dynamic feed, mid-feed theories, they are all there.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This software when new post-graduates come in, you want to introduce them to some of this software.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If you introduce them, fine enough, they will work with it,

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
but then they need to understand the software for them to be able to manipulate it to suit their own personal problem.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Isn't it? That is it.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
There are so many of these software that are now implemented in Python.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I just gave an example of this one that was published recently.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's a very good software, efficient Python implementation of the continuous time hybridization expansion quantum impurity solver.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's a very good one. Then there's this Trios.

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Of course, that one comes both in Python and in C++.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So the students need to understand this software, at least the programming language of this software,

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
for them to be able to manipulate them.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Then of course one thing we also do is that you have a software in another language.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If you want to bring it to Python, which is open source and free,

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
you can also do that like this particular app pack, which is a Fortran package.

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Very beautiful for solving eigenvalue and eigenvector problem, but today they have already imported it into SciPy.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So these are some of the reasons why we have to do computational physics.

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But at large, we know that computer-based activities have pervaded our teaching-learning process,

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
as well as research, so much that in addition to theory and experiments,

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
as we all know now, they now constitute a third pillar in science and engineering.

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Now, but how do we do this? There is a big question.

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The question has been answered here by different speakers.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The first thing is the desire to ease the learner into programming

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and to give them the opportunity to develop a conceptual model of what a program is and what it does.

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay, but how do we, what is the strategy to achieve this computational physics?

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The first thing is accessibility to computer devices, especially in developing countries.

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Here you have a computer science lab or a computational physics program.

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You have a computer lab because if you are taking a computational physics class for three hours,

59
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
you need to be able to have an equivalent three hours in the computer lab.

60
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
In 2008, I attended the conference of, organized by the American Physicist Teacher,

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
a branch university, and at that point, I think at that point,

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
there were about five universities that were offering computational physics in the U.S.

63
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I was told then. I don't know if that has increased,

64
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
meaning that all those universities have computer lab,

65
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
but this is not the case with those developing countries.

66
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You discover that I was teaching computational physics,

67
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and the only lab I have access to was the computer lab, so I have to share with them.

68
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
For a computer science lab that has just one lab from 100 level to 400 level,

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
it was not easy for me to get in computer time,

70
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
so this was one of the problems I faced for so many years.

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Then this idea of using the Q Python came in as a version of Python in Android,

72
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and so when I saw it, of course, it's something you download the entire Q Python into your smartphone,

73
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and once you have done that, you can now begin to use it anywhere, anyhow, and anytime,

74
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and that is the beauty of what we are talking about,

75
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and I hope with that, Dr. Schatz, you talk about taking the Python everywhere,

76
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
so I see that maybe you will also help us in writing a good book on Q Python

77
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
so that you can spread the message everywhere.

78
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Now, I just made sure that there is an attempt in the past to actually have people have access to the computer.

79
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This was what we call the War Laptop A Shied program.

80
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It started in 2002 when Professor Likula, the group member of MIT,

81
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:55,000
he went to Cambodia, a small village, and he was able to see that by letting these young kids there have access to computer,

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
connected computer, they were able to do wonderful things,

83
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
so he came back to MIT and told them that, look, if we can make, I'm just summarizing,

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
make the entire world that every child should have access to a laptop,

85
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
then we won't believe the kind of potential they will have,

86
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and we can't even imagine what kind of problem they are going to solve.

87
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So the program kicked off. Many governments actually came into it.

88
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Unfortunately, the project failed, and one of the reasons, apart from many problems,

89
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
one of the reasons is that they actually produced rugged computers at a very cheap rate,

90
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
but unfortunately, they did not include maintenance and repairs of this computer when they were planning.

91
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So as a computer, they got bad. The kids, they could not repair them, and this became a very serious challenge.

92
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Now, the question is, will QPython not suffer the same fate?

93
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And my answer is broadly no, because it is not going to be government-sponsored.

94
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Smartphones are acquired, maintained, repaired by who? By the individuals.

95
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And we already have an increasing global penetration of smartphones into our homes.

96
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So smartphones belong to the individual, so we are not going to have issues of repair and all that,

97
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
as we have with the one laptop kit.

98
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Of course, this is just a statistic showing that in Africa, the numbers of smartphones are growing.

99
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The reason is this. With $20, I can get a smartphone in Africa.

100
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
With $20, I can get a smartphone in Africa, a good one.

101
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And with that one, I can install my QPython. That is the beauty of it, which is not the same as a laptop.

102
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So our goal is to introduce them into remarkable QPython computing capabilities in smartphones.

103
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But how do we do it? The philosophy is simple.

104
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We want to be able to guide the learners, the students and the learners, such that, of course, that is what we are doing,

105
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
such that the transition from QPython to Python is straightforward.

106
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So once you are able to learn whatever you want to learn in QPython,

107
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
if you have a laptop or any other computer device, it is straightforward.

108
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
There. But how are we doing this? I'm still on the philosophy.

109
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We tell you how to install the QPython. Yes, we'll be having issues with this.

110
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
First, we started with QPython 2.72. Unfortunately, it does not come with a default indentation.

111
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So you have to start teaching your student how to use the tab and all that, and it was not funny.

112
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Good enough, we now have a higher version, 2.715. That one comes with a natural indentation. That one is for education.

113
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So the problem, in fact, it has many of the functionalities as your normal Python.

114
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So another problem we are having is third-party libraries. In the QPython 2.72, we are able to install NumPy.

115
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But this one will be having issues installing NumPy into it, and we are not able to overcome it.

116
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But when I was coming, I was also having the confidence that I would meet somebody who would be able to tell me that,

117
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
look, this is how you can easily do it. Please, if you can, please advise.

118
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Then we teach our students how to use QPython as an advanced calculator.

119
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes, before, students in the, maybe in your, what you call your high school here,

120
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:57,000
they were not allowed to use calculators for some years, but I think for about four or five years now, they now use calculator.

121
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But we are now telling them that, look, your calculator is almost the same size as your smartphone,

122
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and you can actually use your smartphone as an advanced calculator. It can do much more than that.

123
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Then basically, we are coming in as this QPython, using it as an elementary, for elementary programming.

124
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
First, we were able to let our students know the difference between Python 2 version and Python 3.

125
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Then we said about the problem we taught third-party libraries and, of course, the NumPy issue and in short.

126
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Now, when we teach, what we let our students know, the difference between smartphones and computers,

127
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
we give them the value, of course, of Python in Android emulators.

128
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
When we started, of course, in a classroom, we have laptops.

129
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So I said, no, it's going to create problems for me.

130
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Because one of the things where I just make sure, let me just make sure, why I prefer this QPython is that

131
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
before when I teach my students, sending assignments is always difficult.

132
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's not like here, where the internet is free and all that. Sending an assignment is difficult.

133
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But with the QPython now, because with very little amount of money, you can get your phones connected.

134
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So with the QPython, what we are doing now, my student can send the assignment to me easily.

135
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So when I have started this on students thinking with their laptops, okay, no, I want to teach you QPython.

136
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So what we did is that for social data, we use the Android emulators.

137
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We installed the Android emulators into the answer so that it can still work with QPython.

138
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Now we teach them the interpreter, of course, the difference between the interpreter,

139
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
the QPython console, the editor, the syntax, and the various statements, Python variables.

140
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
These are the key things you want to learn in any Python language.

141
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So the important thing here is that of being for science and engineering,

142
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
the model we require is the math model. That is what we use.

143
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So most of the teachings we have been doing is based on this math model,

144
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
and how to use it to solve different problems.

145
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So we have the control statement, we have the functions, the data structures, and of course the class.

146
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But even as simple as this, I started a project which we have done before with Python,

147
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:30,000
before I introduced QPython, and that is how to use the QPython to be able to take an inventory of a lab.

148
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Like you have a lab and you have various equipments.

149
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The ones for mechanics, the ones for electricity, they were all there in the inventory.

150
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So when you go to the small app, you say, what is your name? I'm this. What do you want?

151
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Okay, I want this instrument. Then we say, this instrument is available,

152
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
these are the numbers that are available, and you can find it in so and so shapes.

153
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So with this simple thing, our students over the years are able to repeat this simple project.

154
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Then, the focus on the math model, as I said before, we encourage our students to apply their QPython skills to Python codes.

155
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Like, I've taught you QPython now, but there's a difference between using the QPython and the Python.

156
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
For example, when we say solve quadratic equations, I'm just taking this simple example,

157
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
we use Numpy. Where we use Numpy? We use the polyone deforestation.

158
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The polyone deforestation is a natural thing in Numpy. It will give it a function.

159
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But it's not there in the math lab, in the math model. So how do we do this?

160
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,000
We now ask the students, go and find that. And from there, they were able to see after some time that they can use the lambda expression,

161
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
which is for arbitrary function. So without Numpy now, they are able to solve problems,

162
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:09,000
which of course they use to use just Numpy. They find a way now that they can now use the math lab to solve them.

163
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So the things we do, because it's for science and engineering, we solve things like linear equations, interpolations,

164
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
and we also look at ordinary differential equations with Roche-Coutre, and other methods.

165
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What we do here is this. There is a way here. For us to really motivate the students,

166
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
there's what I call the paper and pen approach. What is the paper and pen approach?

167
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Allow the students to first solve this thing manually, so that they see the way the computer works.

168
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Sometimes you see a problem that will take you three, four pages. But after developing a code with a touch of your keyboard

169
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
or a touch of your smartphone, you see that you can solve the problem.

170
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So the students are able to appreciate what programming is all about.

171
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So these are some of the things we have solved with what? With QPython in our smartphone.

172
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And all this, you can solve them with just the math model.

173
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So what is the outlook here? The outlook is we want a stable version of QPython

174
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:33,000
with easy means to install scientific third-party libraries like Numpy, SciPy, Simpy, and MathPlotlib.

175
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:42,000
There was once a situation if we can add the visual Python, because I miss that a lot.

176
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Of course, when I used to teach with Python, one of the things I used to really inspire my students was

177
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
look at this program, as simple as it is. You go to Visual Python, you just put sphere with your bracket.

178
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And you see a sphere come. You put color, and it gives you the color. So it used to be fun.

179
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I like what Jeff said. He said he has not seen a program that is radically advancing in such a way that it's possible

180
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
he's going to take over other programs. And I'm happy that I'm going to do something with Jeff.

181
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
We've already been discussing even before I came here. We hope we'll be able to move that collaboration,

182
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
because he's also doing something in Africa.

183
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Another thing is that can we have QPython with compound languages like C++, which is widely used for scientific computation?

184
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Can we have various versions like the Piper and the IOPython?

185
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Can we possibly develop very elegant websites designed to develop various QPython apps on smartphones?

186
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I think these are things people have been asking. And I want answers. If you can provide answers to me,

187
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
while I'm around, please, I'll be happy. Because one of the things that is motivating this student is that they say,

188
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:13,000
can I develop my own application with my hands? I say yes, because Python is multipurpose.

189
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It is used for every purpose. It's not used only for the teaching of physics, as we are doing here now,

190
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
but it is multipurpose. So you can begin to develop your own app. And this actually is attaining their interest.

191
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So as part of the outlook, this year, because it's a project I've started the last one year,

192
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and this year I've already been negotiating with the Niger Institute of Physics,

193
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
where they will have their conference in September. And in the Niger Association of Mathematical Physics,

194
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:54,000
they will have their conference in November 2019 on how to have a pre-workshop conference on teaching the teacher.

195
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Here, those who are teachers at this conference, we have two or three days pre-workshop conference on how to teach them

196
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,000
on how to use the handset that is smartphone, QPython. I did a training like that before with the Niger Association of Mathematical Physics,

197
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:19,000
but I used Python. That was two years ago. So this year now, when we had it, we had issues of having a north space,

198
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
having a north space then. But with this one now, I think we'll have that kind of issue.

199
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:34,000
All they have to come, they come with their smartphones. And as I said, smartphone with about $20,

200
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:44,000
you can have an Android version that is compatible with the QPython. And that is the beauty of what we are doing.

201
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Thank you very much.

202
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Do you have any time to reach out to the QPython?

203
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:07,000
No, though I'm on their Facebook, but I've not been able to reach them. But I know they have the opportunity to ask questions, but I know I'm going to reach them.

204
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm still having the feeling that if they did, usually at PyCon conference we meet other people. So I will look for them. Yes.

205
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Yes, Jeff.

206
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:27,000
To follow up on that question, because I'm a big time free software person. So I don't run Android, I run Lineage OS and Ubuntu on my phone.

207
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And so when I tried to install QPython Free on your crack, that was like a showstopper for me after you told me about QPython and I tried it out.

208
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So I'm wondering if we can reach out to the QPython community and see more about fixing problems like that.

209
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yes, they have QPython 3.6. QPython 3.2, QPython 3.4, they are all working, but they don't have the usual default indentation.

210
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:10,000
So the educational QPython, that is the 3.6, that one is having issues. And of course the developers, they've come out to see that they have a lot of bugs which are trying to fix.

211
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But the one, QPython 2.7.15, is working perfectly well. Yes.

212
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I have a question. I am from Nigeria.

213
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Oh, yes.

214
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:39,320
My question is, how are you going to integrate QPython into your

215
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:58,640
science and technology?

216
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:07,960
So I did a project in Japan 20 years ago about the EAMC meeting on COVID and I installed it on the QPython.

217
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:24,960
So how do you, somebody that wants to study in your science, maybe Nigeria, or what do you do out of your project in the U.S.

218
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Okay. We have the National Mathematica Center, Abuja. I hope you are well fit.

219
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:51,960
And around 2008, I started a conference there. We call it the International Seminar on Theoretical, Physical and National Development.

220
00:23:51,960 --> 00:24:01,960
The thing was to honor one of our very senior professors, Professor Emeritus who taught in many universities in the U.S. here.

221
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,960
Before going back to Nigeria, he has produced a lot of people. So when he was 70 years, then I was in Germany.

222
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:15,960
I was at Mas Planck Institute of Physics and Complex System where I was in my post-doc. So I decided to organize a conference for him.

223
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:26,960
After the first one, the second one, in 2010, I added a foundational postgraduate course to it. And that postgraduate course was on Python.

224
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:35,960
So I have been teaching Python as a part of that seminar, which we have been holding annually since 2008.

225
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:44,960
And many of the, when I say teaching the teacher, the National Mathematica Center was actually made for teaching the teacher, the teachers.

226
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,960
And I have been teaching Python there. And I think each year people come back. Do you know how people come back?

227
00:24:51,960 --> 00:25:00,960
They will say, look, I met somebody who said he learned Python and he's now using Python for his work, especially the math plot leap.

228
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,960
They use it in plotting their graph and all kinds of things. And it's quite beautiful.

229
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:12,960
So since 2010, I've been teaching Python at the National Mathematica Center. And I think it has been an overwhelming result.

230
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:25,960
One last question. So one of the reasons I have been skeptical about the Python community is that both of you know that the students in the Moscow conference,

231
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:35,960
that way, for the last 30 years, I have a very different view from some of the other students in the faculty.

232
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:50,960
And there have been some problems because coming from the workforce and there are tech companies where it's very, very difficult to sort of employ your recipe for the complete plan.

233
00:25:50,960 --> 00:26:05,960
So the thing is how do you think that you can suggest for sort of the plans to build a measuring government, to sort of change the curriculum of your project and things like that,

234
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,960
to try to bring things like Python as like, to develop a new design for Python?

235
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,960
You see, what I said is teaching the teacher. That is the first place we have to start from.

236
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:25,960
Because as you said, yes, many of them, the program they know is what they will stick to. So we tell you they are used to foot-fan and all that and they will stick to it.

237
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:35,960
But from our past program, we've seen that when you teach them, many of them, they go back and pass a message around that this programming language is good.

238
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:43,960
And the beauty of it is that they download the whole stuff. I always teach them how to download the whole stuff, you know, without pain and all that.

239
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:52,960
And this is it. And as you have said, I have had the opportunity of firing a number of people.

240
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,960
Like when I attended this conference in 2012, I attended with one of my students, okay?

241
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:06,960
And the good thing here is that when you see brain at once like that, you let them have access to the computer. They can do wonderful things.

242
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:17,960
The young man came here and he got here late. And because of the kind of training I have given to him, they gave him an assignment when he was there and he was the first person to submit.

243
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:25,960
And that was the first day in the class. So the professor said, wow, so look, how can this young man coming from Africa be the first to submit and he got it correct?

244
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:35,960
And so this young man has gone on to obtain his master's and his PhD at Sharpman University. So this is the kind of thing.

245
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:45,960
Then let me just make sure this again. Even within my investing now, I just got an approval from my vice chancellor to organize a workshop on this QPython.

246
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:55,960
As you know, it's not easy driving these things there. But because anything that has to do with spending money, they will avoid it. This is the problem.

247
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,960
But the beauty of QPython, why I am so excited about it, you don't need to spend a cobol.

248
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:08,960
The handset belongs to the person. My own is to show them what to do, that there is power in that handset.

249
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:15,960
You can use that handset to do your programming, to learn your programming anywhere, anyhow, anytime. Thank you.
