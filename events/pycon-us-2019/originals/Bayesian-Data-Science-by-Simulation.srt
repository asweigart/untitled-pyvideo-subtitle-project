1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
if everyone could pass around, you could take one sticky of

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
each and pass them around. We'll use these to say when

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you're done with an exercise and when you need help and that

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
type of stuff. So we'll get all of those sent around.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So now we'll get into the

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
next question.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Who's been using Python for more than two years? Cool.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Who's been using Python for more than five years? Who's

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
been using Python for more than ten years? Yeah. Who loves

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Python?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay. What's that?

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Anyone else less than a year? Fantastic. Yeah.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Appreciate that.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Who considers themselves somewhat proficient with the

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
SciPy stack?

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No, I don't.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Who's been working

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
around the clock?

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We're getting the

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
stickies passed around. Where are they at currently?

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay. Great.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Awesome.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Mm.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, man.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,120
Yeah, it's incredible.

29
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,120
And I'd really, yeah.

30
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,800
And I would encourage you to reach out to the Binder team

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,520
as well and tell them how great you find it.

32
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,480
And if you have any issues, raise issues on the repo

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,920
or pull requests or better.

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,440
But yeah, it's very cool.

35
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,780
I wouldn't suggest doing this now,

36
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,920
but I just found out in Binder, you

37
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,440
see it ends with tree notebooks.

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,720
If you change that to lab, it launches a binder session

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,400
of JupyterLab.

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,200
We're not going to do that now for a reason that may become

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,440
apparent downstream, but it involves IPY widgets.

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,480
So we'll start in a minute.

43
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,320
Eric, did you want to say anything to start or?

44
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,120
Yes, actually.

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,020
OK, so just like with the network analysis tutorial

46
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,920
that I was just in, if you have a question,

47
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,760
I'm going to ask you to raise your hand.

48
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,920
And I will come to you with a mic

49
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,180
because we want to record your questions for posterity

50
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,040
on YouTube so that those who are listening to the tutorial

51
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,280
and following online, believe me, people do it,

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,160
and I've done it before.

53
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,600
They can know the context of what Hugo is going

54
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,400
to be blabbering about.

55
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,800
So please make sure if you have a comment or a question,

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,440
raise your hand.

57
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,040
I will come to you with a mic, and that way

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,960
we'll have it recorded.

59
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,400
And I will be blabbering consistently.

60
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,720
Firstly, I just want to thank PyCon

61
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,480
for accepting this tutorial.

62
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,000
Both Eric and I are really excited to be teaching it.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,240
Eric and I have been talking about this type of stuff

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,200
and teaching this type of stuff for several years,

65
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,240
for three years together now.

66
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,920
And we first taught, I suppose, what

67
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,960
is a foundation of this workshop last year

68
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,800
at SciPy in Austin over the summer,

69
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,840
which was really exciting.

70
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,440
So I'm really happy to be here teaching with Eric again.

71
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,080
And I also just want to thank all of you

72
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,480
for coming and taking an afternoon

73
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,480
to learn this stuff and be interested in this stuff.

74
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,640
I really appreciate all of you being here.

75
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,560
So we're here today to have an introduction to Bayesian

76
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,640
inference, essentially through the world and lens of simulation

77
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,600
and telling stories.

78
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,480
And we're at a very interesting point in time

79
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,040
where we have a lot of fantastic computational tools

80
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,160
to think about probability, which

81
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,320
weren't around 20 years ago.

82
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,240
Definitely weren't around 100 years ago

83
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,520
when people were developing all these frequentus tools.

84
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,320
And so it's actually a very exciting time

85
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,920
to be thinking about these things.

86
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,080
And one thing that we're going to do today

87
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,800
is think about how to talk about probability,

88
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,200
how to think about probability, not using calculus

89
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,240
and equations, but using random number generators,

90
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,000
numplized random number generators,

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,160
and telling stories of probability distributions,

92
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,360
which I personally find very, very exciting.

93
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,720
So we're going to start off with a bunch of probability

94
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,280
via simulation and random number generation.

95
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,520
Then we'll move into conditional joint probabilities

96
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,000
or using a lot of different data sets.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,200
And in the second half, we'll wrap up the first half

98
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,240
with Bayes' theorem.

99
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,840
And then we'll start thinking about Bayesian inference

100
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,720
and how to compute these types of things and answer

101
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,760
data-centric and scientific questions using

102
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,920
the formulations of Bayesian inference.

103
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,880
We'll be doing that via simulation once again.

104
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,400
And time permitting, and I'm pretty sure we'll get there,

105
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,400
we'll wrap up with an intro into the wonderful world

106
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,480
of probabilistic programming languages,

107
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,280
which I find very exciting because as opposed

108
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,720
to most programming paradigms where

109
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,680
you have first-class citizens such as ints and strings,

110
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,440
or in data science, data frames and arrays,

111
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,360
in probabilistic programming, your first-class citizens

112
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,440
are probability distributions.

113
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,120
So we get to work with them directly, which is super cool.

114
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,440
So maybe to get started, I suppose

115
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,000
the other thing to mention is that there's

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,640
going to be a mixture of live coding, which

117
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,680
we'll see how that goes.

118
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,640
And oh, no.

119
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,360
OK, sorry, yeah, this is the wrong direction.

120
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,320
OK, so we're just going to execute the first cell

121
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,640
to import all our packages.

122
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,320
We'll be using some NumPy, some Pandas,

123
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,000
Seaborn, which is data visualization for a few things,

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,160
Matplotlib, which is data visualization.

125
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,360
This Matplotlib inline command allows plots

126
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,400
to appear below cells as output of cells.

127
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,960
sns.set is, you see I've imported Seaborn as sns.set,

128
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,040
makes figures look nicer, essentially.

129
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,400
So we're going to start with part one, although I really,

130
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,880
because it's PyCon, we should start with part zero.

131
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,760
That's a zero indexing joke if nobody got it.

132
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,880
So part one, if you have to explain a joke,

133
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,320
there's a problem there.

134
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,680
So we're going to develop an understanding what probability

135
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,560
means in both Bayesian and frequentist terms.

136
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,480
We're also going to start simulating probability

137
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,400
distributions, that model real world phenomena.

138
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,920
Then we're going to look at how probability distributions relate

139
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,480
to data generating stories, so the data generating processes

140
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,760
and how can we describe them in words and some numbers,

141
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,400
but not a lot of equations.

142
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,120
Then we'll look at joint probabilities

143
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,760
and conditional probabilities.

144
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,680
And then we'll understand Bayes theorem and its utility.

145
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,960
OK, so the first thing, and I want to say,

146
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,040
there's a bit of conceptual overhead here,

147
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,840
but it's worth going into.

148
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,680
People think about probability in a multitude of ways.

149
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,560
And pioneers such as Bernoulli, Bayes, and Laplace

150
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,280
thought about probability as a degree of belief or plausibility.

151
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,400
How much do I believe this thing to be true based on the evidence

152
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,760
that we have at hand?

153
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,640
That seemed like a vague notion at the time,

154
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,160
and there wasn't actually a lot of computational power

155
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,440
to figure out how to formalize this that we have now

156
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,280
and we'll see now.

157
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,080
So what happened is the statisticians of the time

158
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,040
redefined probability as the long run relative frequency

159
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,960
with which an event occurred, given a lot

160
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,840
of repeated experimental trials.

161
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,840
So you experiment, you get a lot of data,

162
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,360
and then whatever proportion you get there

163
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,800
is a probability of some sort.

164
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,400
You can think about error bars or uncertainty around that.

165
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,200
But it's something that can be measured, is the point.

166
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,120
And it was then seen as an objective tool

167
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,440
for dealing with random or stochastic phenomena.

168
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,040
This book, which I got this quotation from,

169
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,680
by Sivya and Skilling, is a must read

170
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,600
for anybody interested in this type of stuff.

171
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,840
It's a really beautiful, short, and more comprehensible,

172
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:52,720
more understandable book than a lot that's out there.

173
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,440
So when we're talking about this type of random phenomena,

174
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,520
we can be talking about so many types of things,

175
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,960
such as click through rate on a website.

176
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,800
So this is a nice example, because if we

177
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,080
know that a website has a click through rate of 10%,

178
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,880
we can then calculate the probability

179
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,880
of having 10, 9, 8 people click through it

180
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,360
upon drawing 10 people randomly for the population.

181
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,680
But that's not the type of question we usually ask,

182
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,840
in science, right?

183
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,680
In science, we usually say, given the data of how many people

184
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,440
click through, how can we calculate the click through

185
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
rate?

186
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,000
And then how certain can we be of this calculated click

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,560
through rate or this estimate?

188
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,160
Or how likely is a particular CTR click through rate?

189
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,960
So I've written this here, but I'm actually

190
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,480
going to write this on my makeshift whiteboard.

191
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,360
Pull this over here so I'm still close to the microphone.

192
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,440
Oh, that's great.

193
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,400
This is embarrassing.

194
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,240
Thanks, man.

195
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,720
There we go.

196
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,680
That's why they call us a team.

197
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,960
So essentially, what I've told you

198
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,560
is that we're quite good at computing the probability

199
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,640
of seeing data, seeing how many people click through,

200
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,280
given, and all this line, this means conditional,

201
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,440
and we'll see what that means a bit more later on.

202
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,040
But given a model, we're pretty good at calculating

203
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,400
the probability of the data.

204
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,080
But in science, we're very often interested

205
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,720
in the probability of the model, given the data

206
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,400
that we've collected.

207
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,720
And moving between these two is essentially highly nontrivial.

208
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,720
But Bayesian inference provides a really

209
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,960
robust and interesting way of doing that.

210
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
OK?

211
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,400
So we'll start thinking about probability

212
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,840
by exploring questions of the first kind,

213
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,080
so the probability of data given an actual model.

214
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,360
And to do this, we're going to start writing some code, OK?

215
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,440
Random number generators.

216
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,080
So the framing of this question is,

217
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,520
let's say that a website has a click-through rate of 50%.

218
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,280
All that means is that 50% of people click through, right?

219
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,120
So if we pick 1,000 people at random from the population,

220
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,080
how likely would it be to find that a certain number of people

221
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,240
click?

222
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,120
I'm just going to edit this slightly.

223
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,920
OK?

224
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,760
And what we can do is we can simulate this.

225
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,960
We don't necessarily need to use equations right at this point.

226
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,800
We can simulate this using NumPy's random number generator.

227
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,360
OK?

228
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,440
So before we do that, though, I'm

229
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,360
going to say we're first going to use NumPy's random.rand

230
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,840
to randomly select floats between 0 and 1.

231
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,040
This is known as the uniform distribution, OK?

232
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,640
So we're going to do this.

233
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,160
So this is code along, right?

234
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,040
OK.

235
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,880
So np.random.rand.

236
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,960
And how many did I say?

237
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,200
Let's do 1,000.

238
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,640
And now I want to plot a histogram.

239
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,800
The reason I've got the semicolon after this,

240
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,000
you may be aware, is there's some text output

241
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,720
that we want to avoid, OK?

242
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,800
OK.

243
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,920
So there we go.

244
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,360
Now, I'm sure a whole bunch of you who work in science

245
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,760
have been like, label your axes.

246
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,880
And I totally agree.

247
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,320
We're not going to do that for the sake of time currently.

248
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,520
But I totally admit that this is like bad practice to not

249
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,760
label axes here.

250
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,920
OK?

251
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,160
So we've got a uniform distribution.

252
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,880
But how does this tell us about how many people click through?

253
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,600
Right?

254
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,600
We can actually use this random number generation process

255
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,240
to figure out how many people click through,

256
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,280
given a particular rate.

257
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,000
The way we do this is, as we've got uniform numbers between 0

258
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,240
and 1, to simulate sampling from the population of people

259
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,440
clicking, we check whether each float was

260
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,040
greater or less than 0.5, OK?

261
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,520
If it's less than or equal to 0.5,

262
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,880
we say the person clicked through.

263
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,920
And this is generalizable to any click through rate, OK?

264
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,440
So let's compute how many people clicked.

265
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,840
So what was the original variable?

266
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,280
It was x.

267
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,760
And I said less than or equal to 0.5.

268
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,840
Can anyone tell me what clicks will be?

269
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,480
So x is an array.

270
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,880
What will clicks?

271
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,600
It will be an array of true or false, of Booleans, right?

272
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,080
Now, the cool thing about Booleans

273
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,680
is they've got arithmetic operations,

274
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,000
so we can add them together.

275
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,920
If someone clicked through, it's going to return true.

276
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,400
If someone didn't click, it's going to return false.

277
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,040
So if I sum together that array, that

278
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,200
will just give me the number of people who click through,

279
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,120
right?

280
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,320
That's pretty handy.

281
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,160
So sum, the number of clicks is the sum of clicks.

282
00:13:53,160 --> 00:14:01,560
And then I'm going to print it out using f strings, which,

283
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,880
so let's do that.

284
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,120
So the number of clicks was 518 out of 1,000,

285
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,480
which isn't quite 50%.

286
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,920
But remember, because we're simulating a phenomenon,

287
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,080
we wouldn't expect it to be exactly 50%, right?

288
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,640
A little note about f strings.

289
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,680
f strings, it's pretty cool.

290
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,840
It was introduced in Python 3.6, I think, right?

291
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,360
And it allows you to include variables

292
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,760
within strings very nicely.

293
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:32,200
I joked once that it was the best thing about Python 3.6.

294
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,360
But I'll never joke about that at PyCon ever again,

295
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,640
because people are pretty opinionated.

296
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,560
OK, so we've got the number of clicks.

297
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,200
Now I want the proportion of clicks, right?

298
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,720
OK, so to get that, we're going to get number of clicks

299
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:56,240
and divide by the total number of people.

300
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,280
And I could divide by 1,000, but just in order

301
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,960
to have it generalizable, the code, I'm just going to,

302
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,080
by the length of clicks.

303
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,600
OK, so up for discussion.

304
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,640
I always do this.

305
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,880
The question I had, did you get the same answer as your neighbor?

306
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,040
And the answer is probably no, because I've already

307
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,120
told you why, because we're simulating a random process,

308
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,560
and there'll be some variation with respect to that.

309
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,680
OK, so let me ask you this.

310
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,200
Let's say that all you had was the data.

311
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,320
We didn't know what the click-through rate was.

312
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,960
We didn't decide it a priori.

313
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,640
All you have is this data, and you

314
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,320
want to figure out the click-through rate.

315
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,920
So that's really the probability of the model, given this data.

316
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,200
What would your estimate for the click-through rate be,

317
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,160
given the data that I have up here?

318
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,160
I'd estimate it to be 1 half, 0.5.

319
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,440
Well, would it?

320
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,680
Because look at the data.

321
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,560
The proportion is actually 0.518, right?

322
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,680
So wouldn't the estimate be 0.518?

323
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,440
So all we have is the data, not the data generating process.

324
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,760
So what's the probability of the click-through rate

325
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,160
being 0.518?

326
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,000
It would be whatever each of us sees on our screen,

327
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,240
given some error, right?

328
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,160
Yes, so that answers my second question.

329
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,640
My first question is, what would your point estimate be?

330
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,560
What would your estimate be?

331
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,080
And it would be what you have on your screen?

332
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,320
Now, how confident?

333
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,120
What would your error bars or confidence

334
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,480
interval around this be?

335
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,760
My error would vary by my sample size,

336
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,640
so smaller the sample, bigger the error.

337
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,680
Yeah, exactly.

338
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,160
Standard on the concept.

339
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,480
And essentially, what we'll see at some point,

340
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,320
well, maybe not today.

341
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,360
It depends how far we get, is that the error

342
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,920
will vary with respect to the square root of the sample size,

343
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,720
one over the square root, in fact.

344
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,160
But the issue is that doing it in a way

345
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,920
that it's not going to be a big problem.

346
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,200
So what would be the error?

347
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,000
Well, the error would be the error

348
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,840
of the sample size, which is the error of the sample size.

349
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,280
But the issue is that doing it in this fashion,

350
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,600
we have no idea what the error is.

351
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,880
What we'll see in a Bayesian framework is that we get out

352
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,360
this estimate, and we actually get a distribution of all

353
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,960
the possible click-through rates.

354
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,840
And from that, we can actually draw out

355
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,200
any information we want about this particular value,

356
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,560
which is really cool.

357
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:35,080
Now, just as a note, I've called it a note there.

358
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,280
I think I called it a keynote last time, which doesn't

359
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,800
make sense at a conference.

360
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,280
So we've described probability in two ways,

361
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,640
but we haven't described it mathematically.

362
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,200
And we're not going to do that today.

363
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,760
We're going to think about probability

364
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,780
as a way of thinking about data-generating processes

365
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,840
in the world and use random number generators

366
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,720
to simulate them and see how that corresponds to our data.

367
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,120
If you're interested in the mathematical descriptions,

368
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,680
essentially, what I'll say is that probability defines

369
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,760
a function from the space of possibilities,

370
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,960
possible values.

371
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,920
In the above, it's the interval 0, 1.

372
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,480
That describes how likely it is to get a particular point

373
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,080
or region in that space.

374
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,680
Michael Bedancourt has an elegant introduction

375
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,760
to probability theory that I can recommend if you're interested.

376
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,960
So all that having been said, it's time for hands-on.

377
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,760
I'd love to take five, maybe five to 10 minutes for you

378
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,080
to use random sampling, as we've done above, to simulate how

379
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,240
many people click when the click-through rate is 0.7.

380
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,560
How many click is one question and what proportion?

381
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,040
So get coding on that.

382
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:54,880
And when you're done, put up the green sticky.

383
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,400
And if you have a question, put up the red one.

384
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:00,900
Yeah.

385
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,380
OK.

386
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:15,280
And if you're done with the exercises,

387
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,640
feel free to move on.

388
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,440
This is a habit that Hugo and I have had.

389
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,880
You can always go beyond us.

390
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,440
But please do remember to put up the sticky just so we have

391
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,040
an indication of how many people.

392
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,720
Just make sure you put up the stickies.

393
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,000
And actually put it on your forehead, not the computer.

394
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,520
No, I'm joking.

395
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,600
That's a ridiculous idea.

396
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:54,940
OK.

397
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,440
Got it.

398
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,780
OK.

399
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,400
We'll have one more minute.

400
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,160
I see a bunch of green stickies coming up.

401
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,160
And if you're having any challenges, Eric's going around.

402
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,460
I'll also say that it's quite similar to the solution

403
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,440
for the 0.5 that we went through together.

404
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,680
OK.

405
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,840
Great.

406
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,880
This is exciting.

407
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,840
So let's see if I can do it.

408
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,280
Good.

409
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,920
So use random sampling to simulate

410
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,360
how many people click through.

411
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,960
You can sample from the uniform distribution once again.

412
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,640
I'm going to be slightly lazy and use the same random numbers

413
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,680
that I generated before.

414
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,520
So because the click-through rate is 0.7,

415
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,720
we're looking for all those that are less than 0.7.

416
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,200
Number of clicks was the sum of clicks.

417
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,640
Remember, because we have that Boolean.

418
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,400
So I got something in my throat.

419
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,280
Number of clicks.

420
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,360
And then once again, how do you get the proportion?

421
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,360
Can someone tell me?

422
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,360
It's not a trick question.

423
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,740
What's that?

424
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:43,860
Exactly.

425
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,640
So it's the number of clicks divided by the length,

426
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,680
the total number of people.

427
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,140
Perfect.

428
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,640
Whoa.

429
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,640
I'm not into that.

430
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,040
I'm definitely, there's a very low probability

431
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,040
that you will get this, right?

432
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,640
Wow.

433
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,140
OK.

434
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,640
Cool.

435
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,040
I like it.

436
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,640
It's an omen of things to come.

437
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,140
OK.

438
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,640
Great.

439
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,640
So now we've generated the proportion.

440
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,140
OK.

441
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,640
Great.

442
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,640
So now we've generated some stuff.

443
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,940
I just want to discuss some similar principles

444
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,140
with real-world data.

445
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,200
You can calculate these types of proportions or proxies

446
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,640
for probability with real-world data.

447
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,640
And we're going to look at the Galapagos Finch Beaks, which

448
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,480
several people went over many years to measure the length

449
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,080
sum to the islands of, I think this one is the island of Daphne

450
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,640
Major, but I need to confirm that.

451
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,640
All the data is here, this hyperlink.

452
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,340
So these are measurements from 2012.

453
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,640
So I'm going to call it DF underscore 12.

454
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,140
OK.

455
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:05,140
So and we're just printing out the first five rows here,

456
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,840
which I would urge people not to do.

457
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,400
Do it now.

458
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,840
But I think someone asked the question a while ago,

459
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,240
like how many mistakes do you think

460
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,880
are made in data science just as an artifact of people looking

461
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,760
at the head of a data frame first?

462
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,480
Right.

463
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,760
Worthwhile question.

464
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,120
Don't have time to think about it right now,

465
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,560
because we're here for probability.

466
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,060
OK.

467
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:30,560
So I just want to take out the lengths.

468
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,320
And this is B length for beak length.

469
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:35,920
Right.

470
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,760
And just we'll see, band doesn't matter.

471
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,560
We'll see the species.

472
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,320
There'll be two species.

473
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,320
We have the beak length and the beak depth.

474
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,400
So we're going to do that.

475
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,120
Now the question is, what proportion of birds

476
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,120
have a beak length greater than 10?

477
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,280
So we can do exactly the same thing

478
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,040
as we did before, where the proportion will be,

479
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:08,000
we'll look at the lengths that are greater than 10.

480
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:16,600
And I'll need to divide that by the total length of so

481
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,000
many lengths happening.

482
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,040
Whoa.

483
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,520
What have I done here?

484
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,960
Yeah.

485
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,600
Yeah, I do.

486
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,400
Thanks.

487
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,480
Lucky I got you here.

488
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,320
OK.

489
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
85.

490
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,320
Just over 85% have lengths greater than 10.

491
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,800
I am.

492
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
I have a question.

493
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Sorry.

494
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,800
I think it's green on the browser.

495
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,280
Oh, I guess.

496
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,760
Yep.

497
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,280
Absolutely.

498
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,920
How is that?

499
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,400
That's better.

500
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:58,900
OK.

501
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,000
If you just give me one.

502
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,200
OK, we're going to keep going and then I'll

503
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,560
figure this out in a second.

504
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,240
So what I want to say is that this

505
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,840
is the proportion of birds in your sample,

506
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,360
in our sample that have a beak length greater than 10,

507
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,720
in the empirical data, not the probability

508
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,160
that any bird drawn from the population

509
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,040
will have this beak length.

510
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,000
So always remember, sample is different from population.

511
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
But we can use samples to think about proxies for probability.

512
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,960
And one way to do that, which we'll mention now,

513
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,560
see a bit more later, is via resampling.

514
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,440
So essentially, what we do is we look at this data set

515
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:47,160
that we have and draw, treat it like a population

516
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,400
and draw new data points from it.

517
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,480
So thanks.

518
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,160
We'll simulate drawing random samples with replacement.

519
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,240
So we'll draw one, put it back, then from the same set,

520
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,400
we'll draw again to see how many lengths are greater than 10

521
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,160
and calculate the proportion.

522
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,760
And this is something known as, well,

523
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,920
it's been dubbed as hacker statistics

524
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,120
because we're essentially using computational hacker

525
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,400
techniques to think about statistics.

526
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,560
And you can get distributions out this way, et cetera.

527
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:27,560
So we're going to, let me get this right.

528
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,000
Yep, so what I'm going to do is I'm

529
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,720
going to draw 10,000 different data points out

530
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,720
of our sample, which is actually quite smaller.

531
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,800
So we're going to take the sum.

532
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,680
Now, to randomly sample from it, we're

533
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,680
going to do np.random.choice.

534
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,320
Now, we're sampling from lengths.

535
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,040
Now, how many do we want?

536
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,720
The next argument is the number of samples.

537
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,000
And we want to be able to do it with replacement.

538
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,440
So we're going to set the keyword argument replace

539
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,040
equal to true.

540
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,640
Now, this will give us 10,000 samples.

541
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,080
And we want to see how many of those are greater than 10,

542
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,760
and then divide by the number of samples.

543
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,560
And once again, we see something quite close.

544
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,680
Now, the reason I wanted to mention this now

545
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,960
is now we've got not just a proportion,

546
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,620
but a proxy for probability.

547
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,600
Now, the really cool thing is, what we just

548
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,240
did and what you just did, I just

549
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,680
love that you've got a green sticky on your head still.

550
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,200
It's awesome.

551
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,320
It's really, really positive.

552
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,600
What we can do is we could do this procedure 1,000 times

553
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,560
and get out a variety of different results.

554
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,240
And that will give us a distribution.

555
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,000
So we'll know more about uncertainty in that sense

556
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,080
as well.

557
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,960
But we'll say a bit more about that later.

558
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,760
Now it's time to get to some really fun stuff.

559
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,840
Not that that wasn't fun.

560
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,840
It's just going to get funner.

561
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,520
That's an Australian term for more fun, by the way.

562
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:10,200
I don't know if people say funner in this great nation.

563
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,320
So in the above, we've used the uniform distribution

564
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,040
to sample from a series of bias coin flips.

565
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,600
But some of you may know that these bias coin flips

566
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,240
or click-through rates are actually

567
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,920
called a binomial distribution as well, right?

568
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,720
We've got a question up back.

569
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Just wait for the mic.

570
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,480
So I have a question to the validity of the method above,

571
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,120
the resampling thing.

572
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:46,080
So would you say that if we resample and do it many times,

573
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,320
we know more about the probability now?

574
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,600
We used the data set, which had just a very limited sample

575
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,040
size, right?

576
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,920
Now we resampled it, and I did many times.

577
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,760
Do we know more about standard deviation, standard error?

578
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,440
I mean, what do we know actually now?

579
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,680
Yeah, you can get out.

580
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,120
Once you do that a number of times,

581
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,680
you can get out standard deviation.

582
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,040
You can get out standard error.

583
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,520
Also, notice that we're not presuming any model.

584
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,320
So it's actually a non-parametric technique

585
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,080
for getting out the distribution.

586
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,480
You can get out percentiles.

587
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,760
You can get out a lot of different things.

588
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
And for this to be reliable, does the sample

589
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,640
have to be of a certain size?

590
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,880
That's a good question.

591
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,080
Yeah, there are certain.

592
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,520
I'd suggest checking out Efron's original bootstrapping

593
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,240
paper to figure out the actual.

594
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,880
There are very few assumptions, but sample size is important.

595
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,800
Great question.

596
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,480
Thank you.

597
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,600
So let's think about the binomial.

598
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,000
So with the click-through rate, I'm

599
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,480
not sure that I mentioned that this can also be thought of

600
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,000
as a biased coin flip.

601
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,040
But this is kind of the more abstract model

602
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,000
that people think about is flipping a coin with probability

603
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,600
of heads being 0.7 or 0.5, as we've seen.

604
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,160
Just as a click-through rate can be modeled as that.

605
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,760
Incidence of disease also modeled as that.

606
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,160
So it's quite an abstract model that's used in a lot

607
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,000
of different places.

608
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,240
More generally, the binomial distribution,

609
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,200
it has two parameters, n and p.

610
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,360
And it's defined as the probability distribution

611
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,360
of the number of heads seen when flipping a coin n times

612
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,200
with the probability of heads being p.

613
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,240
And that's the story.

614
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,120
That's the story of the binomial distribution.

615
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,720
I could write out the equation for you,

616
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,520
and you could work with that.

617
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,560
But now we know the story, and we can simulate it.

618
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,880
We can actually work with it in a lot of different ways.

619
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,320
And as I wrote here, this distribution

620
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,440
tells the story of a general model in the following sense.

621
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,760
If you believe that you're collecting data in the world

622
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,200
that has an underlying data-generating process

623
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,320
with a binary outcome, and that one of the two outcomes

624
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,520
occurs with probability p, then that story

625
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,640
is the binomial story.

626
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,120
So you can model your data using the binomial distribution.

627
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,520
And what you can do, as we'll see,

628
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,800
is not worry about equations or fits

629
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,240
or anything along those lines.

630
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,840
You can plot what the binomial distribution would look like.

631
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,560
You can plot your data and just eyeball and see whether it

632
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,200
seems like a good fit initially.

633
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,480
And we're going to be doing that time and time again.

634
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,400
I'll reformulate this slightly and say

635
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,160
that any process that matches this is a binomial process,

636
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,960
as I said.

637
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,240
You'll also see individual coin flips referred to as Bernoulli

638
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,800
trials in the literature.

639
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,080
This is because this was discovered or created

640
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,320
this theory by, I can't remember if it was Daniel Bernoulli

641
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,600
or Jacob Bernoulli.

642
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,920
But whichever one it was literally sat there flipping

643
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,760
coins for date.

644
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,360
Like, no, he did what we're doing, but flipping coins

645
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,720
and writing down the results like tens of thousands of times.

646
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,080
So we should all be grateful.

647
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,160
Formulating this story in terms of Bernoulli trials,

648
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,080
the story of the binomial distribution

649
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,960
is the number r of successes in n Bernoulli trials

650
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,580
with probability of p of success is binomially distributed.

651
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,540
So we're now going to use the binomial distribution

652
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,180
to answer the same question as above.

653
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,940
OK?

654
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,380
And what I mean by that is we used the uniform distribution

655
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,940
before, and we're going to see it as binomial.

656
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,340
First, I'm going to set the seed.

657
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,540
We're randomly generating numbers.

658
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,780
Our computers use something that's

659
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:37,700
known as a pseudo-random number generator.

660
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,660
And what that means is that once I can set the seed,

661
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,220
it's pseudo-random because once I set a particular seed,

662
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,580
the random number generator starts from that point.

663
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:50,180
And setting that seed will give the same random numbers

664
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:50,820
after the fact.

665
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,700
So if you and I set the same seed,

666
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,260
then we'll get everything the same.

667
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,340
And this is very important, of course,

668
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,300
for reproducible science.

669
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,980
So I'm going to set the seed.

670
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,460
What am I going to set the seed to be?

671
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,620
Feel free to set the seed to be whatever you want, essentially.

672
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:21,140
I'm going to set it to be my birthday, the way that we write

673
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:25,460
birthdays and dates in general.

674
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,420
It's weird that you all know my birthday now,

675
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:31,620
but feel free to reach out on July 16

676
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:36,740
with wishes of prosperity and happiness.

677
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,420
So the cool thing about simulating stuff

678
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,220
is we did np.random.rand.

679
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,860
Or you can also do uniform, but we did rand before.

680
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,740
np.random.

681
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,620
If we're doing a binomial distribution,

682
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,740
does anyone have an idea of what the function's

683
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,020
going to be called?

684
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,020
Binomial, yeah, definitely not a trick question.

685
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,460
And that's pretty cool.

686
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,740
And we want to flip the coin 10 times.

687
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:09,860
And p is 0.7, so that's the second argument.

688
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,780
And look, come on, seriously.

689
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,360
I really didn't want to get seven there,

690
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:19,540
but this is some black wizardry we have here.

691
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,700
But OK, what we'll see, though, is

692
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,780
so that's if we do this binomial trial once.

693
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,540
If we flip a coin 10 times, now we've got seven heads.

694
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,780
Unlikely, but cool.

695
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,180
And as I write here, in the above,

696
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,180
we've simulated the scenario once.

697
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,140
This only tells us one potential outcome.

698
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,660
So let's now just simulate it 1,000 times.

699
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,660
Or let's simulate it 10.

700
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,340
I don't even care.

701
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:47,500
We can simulate it like a million times and see

702
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,540
what happens.

703
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:53,060
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to, once again,

704
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,820
and this is one of the great things about NumPy random,

705
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,780
is that I can do the same as I did before.

706
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,980
So I've got 10.

707
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,980
Let me just get this right.

708
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:17,580
10, 0.7.

709
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,020
And now I can just choose to do it as many times as I want.

710
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,260
So this will be the size.

711
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:26,060
This is the number that I get out.

712
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,340
And then I'm going to plot the histogram.

713
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,580
I'm going to plot it normalized.

714
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,340
We get a density.

715
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,620
We get a fraction, a proportion, essentially.

716
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,260
We'll see what that means.

717
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,220
OK.

718
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,980
Cool.

719
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,180
This is nice, right?

720
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,060
So we'll see.

721
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,460
And I'll just, I'm actually, just for clarity's sake,

722
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:49,140
I'm going to just print x here.

723
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,820
We'll see x.

724
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,700
Before this just gave out one number.

725
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,100
Now it's actually going to give out 10,000 different results.

726
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,300
So x is an array of all the 10,000.

727
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,460
We're plotting a histogram of that.

728
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,740
And what do we see here?

729
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:09,340
I mean, we see pretty unlikely to get anything down here.

730
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,900
But as we get more and more, we'll

731
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,660
see 7 is the most likely, as you'd expect.

732
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,580
And then it goes down and down and down.

733
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,500
And 10 is the maximum you'll get, right?

734
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,100
OK.

735
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,580
So that's pretty cool that what Daniel or Jacob Benouli,

736
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,260
I mean, they were brothers.

737
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,020
They probably flipped coins together.

738
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,500
That was a weird remark.

739
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,780
You know, we just got to do 10,000 sets of 10 coin flips

740
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,020
using our random number generators

741
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,260
and getting out this normalized histogram, which

742
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,380
is pretty cool, OK?

743
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,980
Once again, I answered the group chat.

744
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,820
What do you see in the above?

745
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,620
And the point is there's a peak at 7,

746
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,740
and it goes down on either side.

747
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,660
So having said that, it wasn't so unlikely

748
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,140
that we got 7 there.

749
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,860
Got 7 there?

750
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,580
I mean, it was the most likely.

751
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,620
OK, all that having been said, I think

752
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,260
what I'd love for you all to do now

753
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,100
is to use the tools that we've just developed

754
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,420
to start flipping some bias coins

755
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,580
and answer these questions.

756
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,620
So the first one is, if I flipped a bias coin with

757
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,660
probability of heads 0.3 20 times,

758
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,860
what's the probability of five or more heads?

759
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,340
And then there's a similar question,

760
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,940
and then I'll get you to plot something.

761
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,140
And I'll give you 5 to 10 minutes to do that.

762
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,380
So take down your green stickies, please,

763
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,980
if they're still up from before.

764
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,620
And then get coding.

765
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:51,640
OK.

766
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,640
OK.

767
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:51,640
OK.

768
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:46,340
So if you get stuck at all, just go back and look through some

769
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,620
of the stuff we've done together.

770
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,420
Remember, there are clues everywhere.

771
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,940
That's my new mantra.

772
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,120
OK.

773
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,120
OK.

774
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,620
All right, we'll take a couple more minutes.

775
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:10,020
And then as a teaser, things are about to get really fun.

776
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,300
We're going to have a battle between histograms

777
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,420
and empirical cumulative distribution functions.

778
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,100
Spoiler, ACDS win.

779
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:57,980
All right, everyone, I'm going to get moving on this.

780
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:03,780
So I'm flipping a coin 20 times, probability 3.

781
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:10,860
So once again, I'm going to be doing NP.random.what?

782
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,820
Binomial.

783
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,380
This is great.

784
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,660
It's like a colon response.

785
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,260
How's that?

786
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:22,340
I don't even know if that was a hip hop reference or what that was.

787
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:26,260
And look, I'm going to do this experiment 10,000 times.

788
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,980
You can do it as many as you want, essentially.

789
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:34,980
And I want to know when that's greater than or equal to 5.

790
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,300
That will give me the Boolean, so I want to sum that up.

791
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,700
And then I want to divide that by the number of times I did it.

792
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,380
OK?

793
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,340
OK.

794
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,460
Good.

795
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,660
That's the probability of getting five or more heads.

796
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,460
OK?

797
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,100
Now similarly, calculate the probability of five more heads

798
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,100
for p is equal to 5.

799
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,900
I'm going to get a bit lazy here and just copy and paste, right?

800
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:03,460
If you copy and paste three or more times, what do you do?

801
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,300
You write a function.

802
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,140
Thank you.

803
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:08,620
Great.

804
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,100
Eric will tell you that as well.

805
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,500
OK.

806
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,500
So if you flip a fair coin 20 times, the probability of five or more heads

807
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,500
is 99.5.

808
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,500
And that makes sense.

809
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,180
I mean, OK.

810
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,300
So plot the normalized histogram of number of heads,

811
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,620
flipping a fair coin 10 times.

812
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,180
OK.

813
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:32,940
I think I can do that.

814
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:41,780
Really embarrassing if I just couldn't for a long time.

815
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,980
The rest of the workshop was me trying to do that.

816
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:51,500
So doing that, 10 times fair coin.

817
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:57,060
Now I'm going to plot the histogram of x.

818
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,940
Because I want it normalized, I'm going to do density equal true.

819
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,900
And I'll set the number of bins equal to 10.

820
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,420
OK.

821
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,700
Probably need to close that out.

822
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,220
OK.

823
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:11,700
Cool.

824
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:17,220
Did most people get something like that?

825
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,220
Cool.

826
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,220
Quick question.

827
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:24,220
Does this look like anything to you?

828
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,220
It's a binomial distribution.

829
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,220
But does it look like any other?

830
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,220
It looks kind of normal or Gaussian-y.

831
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,220
And that's telling.

832
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,820
And we may not get to this in this workshop, unfortunately.

833
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,820
But in certain limits, the binomial looks like something else.

834
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,860
You can prove that in a number of ways, one of which is the central limit theorem.

835
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:45,860
What we will see soon is the limit in which the binomial distribution turns into the Poisson

836
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:50,860
distribution, which is really cool.

837
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:51,860
OK.

838
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:56,860
So this is a key point now that I don't want to spend a lot of time on.

839
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:01,860
But you may have noticed that the binomial distribution can take only a finite number

840
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:06,860
of values, whereas the uniform can take only a finite number of values.

841
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,900
The uniform can take any number between 0 and 1.

842
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,900
And these are different enough to make mention of them.

843
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,900
The former is called a probability mass function.

844
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,900
That's where you have a discrete number of possibilities.

845
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,900
And the latter, a probability distribution function, or PDF.

846
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,900
Going on, we may discuss this a bit more.

847
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,900
But I wanted to make that very clear.

848
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,900
And once again, severe and skilling is a great reference for this.

849
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,900
I'll also provide a link maybe in the next iteration.

850
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,940
A lot of the work of Alan Downey, who will probably see some of his stuff later on.

851
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,940
He does a lot of incredible work on this stuff.

852
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,940
So I have a question for you.

853
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:50,940
Looking at this histogram, can you tell me the probability of seeing four or more heads?

854
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,940
Can someone easily read off that histogram?

855
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,940
So you'd like the way I'd do it.

856
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,940
And if like this is my naive way of doing it,

857
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:09,980
I'd like add up the proportions across four or more or three or less

858
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,980
and then subtract that from blah, blah, blah.

859
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,980
That seems like hard work to me.

860
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,980
And it seems kind of counterintuitive.

861
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:24,980
I'm just wondering if there are any other types of figures that could help us with this.

862
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:31,980
And lo and behold, enter the empirical cumulative distribution function,

863
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,020
which is one of my favourite plots.

864
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:39,020
And empirical and we're going to be building a lot of these actually.

865
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,020
It's an alternative to a histogram.

866
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:45,020
It's a way to visualise univariate data, so data of one variable.

867
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:48,020
And the eCDF is super rich in information.

868
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,020
So it allows you to visualise all your data.

869
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,020
There is no binning bias.

870
00:48:53,020 --> 00:49:00,020
And some people think binning bias in histograms is a very archaic or not relevant problem.

871
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:04,060
But in terms of even thinking about multimodality of distributions

872
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,060
or where these things occur,

873
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:12,060
you can tell a lot of lies with histograms by choosing bin sizes inappropriately.

874
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:15,060
So you avoid binning bias with an eCDF.

875
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,060
So you plot all the data.

876
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,060
You can also plot controls and experiments.

877
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:23,060
You can plot data and models, which really means many populations.

878
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,060
You can see multimodality, though it's slightly less pronounced.

879
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:31,100
And if you think, what we'll see is that for the more mathematically inclined,

880
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:39,100
an eCDF is the integral of...

881
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,100
Is that right?

882
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,100
Yeah, integral of the PDF.

883
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,100
And what happens when you integrate,

884
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,100
modes or peaks become points of inflection.

885
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,100
So you see that there.

886
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:53,100
And you can just read off so much stuff from eCDFs, such as percentiles.

887
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:58,140
I would really advise you to see Eric Ma's great post on eCDFs here

888
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:02,140
and this Twitter thread, thanks to Alan Downey.

889
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:05,140
And Eric, like, I'm telling you, I love eCDFs.

890
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:09,140
If you speak to this guy about eCDFs afterwards,

891
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:14,140
you'll come away with a different worldview, I think.

892
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,140
I just want to show you one thing that happened recently.

893
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:22,140
I saw a really bad histogram in a paper a few weeks ago

894
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,180
on Friday afternoon before lunch.

895
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:28,180
And so before going out to lunch, I just tweeted out three words.

896
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,180
I tweeted out, stop plotting histograms.

897
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:36,180
And I went to lunch and came back to, like, essentially a lot of abuse.

898
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,180
So, yeah, this is...

899
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,180
I don't know what time... why I thought I was in that time zone.

900
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,180
Maybe it's because I set up Twitter in Australia.

901
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,180
But, you know, stop plotting histograms.

902
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,180
Someone wrote, can we stop Brexit first?

903
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,180
Fonsbeck wrote, plot several histograms.

904
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:51,180
Michael Bencourt, good friend of mine, threatening me with fighting.

905
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,220
And then they... it keeps going on.

906
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:56,220
Then I start swearing and saying, let's teach people more broadly.

907
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,220
You're the guy who, you know...

908
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,220
And it just goes on and on and on.

909
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,220
Andy Muller called dev of psychic learn.

910
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,220
You know, like it's... yeah.

911
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,220
Essentially, I just left it alone

912
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:10,220
and saw the whole Twitterverse explode, attack me.

913
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,220
And I left it for a day.

914
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,220
Then people started defending me.

915
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,220
Then people started attacking again.

916
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,220
And it's just...

917
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,220
Twitter's a beautiful place, isn't it?

918
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,260
Enough about that, though.

919
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,260
OK, so to define...

920
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,260
Please, Eric.

921
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,260
Sorry, Hugh.

922
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,260
I just wanted to make one point of clarification.

923
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,260
It's that it's not the eCDF

924
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,260
that is the integral over the PDF

925
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,260
of a probability distribution.

926
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,260
It's just the CDF.

927
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,260
Yes, the cumulative distribution function

928
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:43,260
is the integral of any continuous probability distributions PDF.

929
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,260
All right?

930
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:47,260
So if you take the derivative of the probability distribution

931
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:52,300
and the derivative of the cumulative distribution function

932
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,300
which runs from 0 to 1,

933
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:59,300
you will get back the probability distribution function.

934
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,300
And we'll see that.

935
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,300
And I suppose the point is that

936
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,300
the empirical cumulative distribution function

937
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,300
is from data,

938
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,300
whereas the cumulative distribution function

939
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,300
is from a probability distribution.

940
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,300
OK?

941
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,300
So to define it,

942
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,300
in an eCDF, the x-axis is the range of possible values

943
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,300
for the data.

944
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,340
And for any given x value, the corresponding y value

945
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:21,340
is the proportion of data points less than or equal

946
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,340
to that x value.

947
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,340
OK?

948
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,340
Now, that's a bit of a mouthful.

949
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,340
But we're going to make one now.

950
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,340
What I'm going to do first, though,

951
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,340
is define a handy eCDF function

952
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:35,340
that takes in data and outputs the x and y data

953
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,340
for the eCDF.

954
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:40,340
So what we do is we compute the number of data points,

955
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,340
then we sort the data,

956
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:47,380
and then we take the y data for each data point.

957
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,380
So we'll just get you to execute that cell.

958
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:53,380
Now, what I want to tell you

959
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,380
is that I'm going to get you to do this now.

960
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,380
Actually, no, I'm going to do this,

961
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,380
and then you can plot eCDFs later on.

962
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,380
That's great.

963
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,380
I think the first time I should demonstrate.

964
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,380
So we've got...

965
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,380
OK, this has to be the, not he.

966
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,380
OK?

967
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:14,420
So we generate x and y data for the...

968
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,420
So this is for the following,

969
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,420
for the previous question, I'm sorry.

970
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,420
Please read the answer to the following question.

971
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:24,420
Is that what I wanted?

972
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,420
Yeah, so I want the previous data, OK?

973
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,420
So to do that, remember this eCDF function

974
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,420
just takes in the data,

975
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,460
so I'm going to do eCDF,

976
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,460
x, OK?

977
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,460
Now I'm going to plot it.

978
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,460
plt.plot

979
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,460
Now the x data is x flips,

980
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:57,460
y data is y flips.

981
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:00,460
Now I'm going to add a few more

982
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:03,460
little quags, keyword arguments.

983
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,460
It'll create a line,

984
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,460
and I don't necessarily want a line per se,

985
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,500
so I'm going to have dots as markers

986
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,500
and I'm going to have line style

987
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,500
equal to none, OK?

988
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,500
Let's just do that again.

989
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,500
OK, beautiful.

990
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,500
Once again, I haven't labelled my axes, but that's OK.

991
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,500
So what we actually see,

992
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,500
the question is, what's the probability

993
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,500
of seeing four or more heads?

994
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,500
So these are the number of heads in these trials

995
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,500
and we'll see that the probability

996
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,500
of seeing four or more heads

997
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,540
is 80%.

998
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,540
OK, the probability of seeing

999
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,540
less than four heads is 20%, right?

1000
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,540
So the probability of seeing

1001
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,540
four or more heads is 80%, OK?

1002
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,540
Yeah, 80%-ish.

1003
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,540
Yeah, it's actually just like,

1004
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,540
it's probably 82 or something like that.

1005
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:54,540
You can do that calculation.

1006
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,540
But having said that, you can read off the median,

1007
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,540
you can read off all types of percentiles,

1008
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,540
your 95 percentile,

1009
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,540
your 25, your 75,

1010
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,580
you can read off all your percentiles

1011
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,580
and do all of these types of calculations as well.

1012
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,580
And I want to add one more piece.

1013
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,580
So for those of you who are in the network analysis tutorial,

1014
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,580
whatever I said there, Hugo has just repeated.

1015
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:18,580
And there's, looking at this,

1016
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:21,580
there's even more information that you can get

1017
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:24,580
for the case of a discrete probability distribution,

1018
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,580
which is what we have here.

1019
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:28,580
If you look at all the points stacked up,

1020
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:31,580
the height tells you the amount of credibility

1021
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,580
associated with that number,

1022
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,620
so which is the most probable number?

1023
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,620
The one that has the highest amount of height.

1024
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,620
Try reading that off a histogram, fighting words.

1025
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,620
Yeah, I like it.

1026
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,620
See, that's what I'm talking about.

1027
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,620
I'm the good cop.

1028
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,620
I took the full amount, yes.

1029
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,620
At that point, we'll, yeah.

1030
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,620
I guess you could also use just the histogram

1031
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:58,620
and add the cumulative equals true parameter

1032
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,620
and you would get the same thing, right?

1033
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,620
OK.

1034
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,660
Yes, but you would still have the binning bias

1035
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,660
if you didn't bin correctly.

1036
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,660
So if you're, yes, exactly.

1037
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,660
And there was a question behind?

1038
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,660
OK, great.

1039
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,660
And so the one thing I want you to notice here,

1040
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,660
let's say I had 10 different populations.

1041
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,660
I could plot them all in different colors

1042
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,660
or different transparencies here.

1043
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,660
Try doing that with, I mean, you see histograms

1044
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:29,660
of people plotting like all of these overlapping things.

1045
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,660
But I could plot a model here as well

1046
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,700
and then control and experiment.

1047
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:37,700
But OK, I want to move on to really,

1048
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,700
we've talked about probability distributions

1049
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,700
and some of their stories.

1050
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,700
I really want to get into this now.

1051
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,700
Before I do, though, I want to thank Justin Boyce

1052
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,700
who is a very old friend and collaborator.

1053
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,700
He's appeared several times on a podcast that I host

1054
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,700
called Data Framed that I'd all urge you to listen to

1055
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,700
to help me meet my KPIs at work, essentially.

1056
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,700
I know they're OKRs,

1057
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,740
I know they're OKRs now, whatever.

1058
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,740
But Justin and I have spoken,

1059
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,740
it must be for 100 hours, about this type of stuff.

1060
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,740
So he's a lecturer at Caltech teaching this type of stuff.

1061
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,740
The material he's developed

1062
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:18,740
has changed the way I think about probability simulation

1063
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,740
and telling stories.

1064
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,740
So I want to shout out to him.

1065
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,740
I also want to say I think some of this

1066
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:26,740
I actually just directly plagiarized from him.

1067
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,740
But I think the license he used allows me to do that.

1068
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,780
So it's all good.

1069
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,780
OK, so once again,

1070
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,780
we saw we can match data-generating processes

1071
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,780
with binary outcomes to the story

1072
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,780
of the binomial distribution,

1073
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:44,780
given another characteristic of Bernoulli trials.

1074
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:47,780
Now I want to tell you about the Poisson distribution,

1075
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,780
how we can think about the Poisson distribution

1076
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,780
by telling stories.

1077
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,780
So there's a great book by David McKay

1078
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:56,780
called Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms.

1079
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,780
He tells the story of a town called Poissonville

1080
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:00,820
in which the buses have a very odd schedule.

1081
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,820
OK, so if you stand at a bus stop in Poissonville,

1082
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,820
the amount of time you have to wait for a bus

1083
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:09,820
is totally independent of when the previous bus arrived.

1084
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,820
So what this means is you could watch a bus drive off

1085
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:14,820
and another arrive almost instantaneously,

1086
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,820
or you could be waiting for hours.

1087
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:18,820
Now this seems like it probably wouldn't happen.

1088
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,820
I live in New York City,

1089
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,820
and the subway system does operate like that,

1090
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,820
I feel, a lot of the time.

1091
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,820
Having said that,

1092
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,860
there are a lot of natural processes

1093
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,860
which follow Poisson processes.

1094
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,860
So natural births in a given hospital, OK,

1095
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:39,860
is one.

1096
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,860
There is a well-defined average number of natural births per year

1097
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,860
and the timing of one birth is independent

1098
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:45,860
of the timing of the previous one.

1099
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,860
Why is it important that I said natural births?

1100
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,860
You can't schedule them.

1101
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,860
You can't schedule them.

1102
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,900
If you had to schedule births in general,

1103
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,900
it wouldn't be true,

1104
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,900
because induced births actually happen

1105
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,900
with respect to certain schedules

1106
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,900
of doctors' availability, nurses,

1107
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,900
a lot of different things play into that.

1108
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,900
So they're not Poisson processes.

1109
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,900
Landings on a website can follow Poisson processes.

1110
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,900
Media strikes, molecular collisions in a gas,

1111
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,900
aviation incidents,

1112
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:19,900
and any process that matches the buses in Poissonville story

1113
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,900
is a Poisson process, OK?

1114
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:24,940
So what then is a Poisson distribution?

1115
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,940
A Poisson distribution

1116
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,940
is the number of arrivals of a Poisson process

1117
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,940
in a given amount of time, OK?

1118
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,940
And it has one parameter,

1119
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,940
the average number of arrivals in a given length of time.

1120
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,940
So to match the story,

1121
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:42,940
we could consider the number of hits on a website in an hour

1122
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,940
with an average of six hits per hour,

1123
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:46,940
this being Poisson distributed, OK?

1124
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,940
Now, what I'm going to do

1125
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,940
is I'm just going to generate that data now

1126
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:53,980
so we can see what it looks like, OK?

1127
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,980
So what I've said is

1128
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,980
the Poisson distribution

1129
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,980
has one parameter,

1130
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,980
the average number of arrivals in a given length of time.

1131
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,980
So I'm going to generate

1132
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,980
np.random.

1133
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,980
So if it's a Poisson distribution,

1134
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,980
what do you think the next...

1135
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,980
It's not a trick question.

1136
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,980
It's Poisson, but lambda will...

1137
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,980
Yes, so lambda is the variable.

1138
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,980
But the name of the function

1139
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,020
is Poisson.

1140
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:25,020
And I can just use a positional argument.

1141
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,020
I don't need to use a keyword argument.

1142
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,020
I'm going to use the size

1143
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:31,020
equal 10...

1144
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:33,020
Let's just say 10 to the power 6.

1145
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,020
Now I'm going to plot this.

1146
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:40,020
Samples, and I'm going to choose

1147
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:43,020
21 bins.

1148
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:46,020
Yep, didn't work.

1149
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,060
OK.

1150
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,060
Bins.

1151
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:55,060
OK.

1152
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:57,060
Cool.

1153
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:59,060
So this, if I take this many samples,

1154
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:01,060
is what our Poisson distribution looks like.

1155
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,060
And you'll see that the average is

1156
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,060
around 6,

1157
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:07,060
the average of 6 landings on a website

1158
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:09,060
in 10 minutes.

1159
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:11,060
So what we've done, we can write down

1160
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:13,060
the equation of the Poisson distribution for sure.

1161
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,060
But we've actually

1162
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,100
rigorously defined it

1163
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,100
using a story

1164
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,100
and able to simulate it now and understand it

1165
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,100
without using the math or the calculus.

1166
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,100
And I actually think this is incredibly powerful

1167
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,100
and it will allow a lot more people

1168
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,100
to kind of...

1169
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,100
It reduces the barrier to entry for people who don't

1170
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,100
necessarily have a serious background

1171
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,100
in calculus.

1172
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,100
Question, does this distribution

1173
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,100
look like anything to you

1174
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,100
that we've seen before or you've seen before?

1175
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,100
It's kind of normal.

1176
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:49,100
It's not quite because it's definitely not symmetric

1177
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,100
but I can see why you'd say that.

1178
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,100
What's one we've seen earlier today

1179
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,100
that was kind of normally but not symmetric?

1180
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,100
Binomial, right?

1181
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,100
It's kind of binomial-esque.

1182
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,100
OK, that's a new term.

1183
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,100
OK, and in fact

1184
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,100
the Poisson distribution is

1185
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,100
the limit of the binomial distribution

1186
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,100
for low probability of success

1187
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,100
and large number of trials

1188
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,140
and I've written this here but I actually want to go through it.

1189
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:17,140
So let's think about

1190
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,140
this is one of the greatest things about telling these stories.

1191
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,140
You can show that in

1192
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:23,140
the limit of low probability

1193
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:25,140
and large number of trials. You can show mathematically

1194
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,140
that the binomial

1195
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,140
and the Poisson converge or they're approximate, right?

1196
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:31,140
But you can also do it just by telling the stories, OK?

1197
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:33,140
So think about the stories.

1198
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,140
You're doing a Bernoulli trial

1199
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:37,140
once a minute for an hour

1200
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,140
each with a success of probability

1201
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:41,140
of 0.05

1202
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:43,180
you do 60 trials

1203
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:45,180
the number of successes is binomially distributed

1204
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,180
and we'd expect to get about three successes, right?

1205
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,180
So this is

1206
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,180
the same as the Poisson story of seeing

1207
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:53,180
three buses on average arrive

1208
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:55,180
in a given interval of time.

1209
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:57,180
What this means is that the Poisson distribution

1210
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,180
with the arrival rate equal to

1211
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:01,180
n times p from the binomial

1212
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,180
distribution approximates that binomial

1213
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,180
distribution, OK?

1214
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:07,180
The reason this can be useful, practically

1215
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:09,180
is the Poisson distribution can be simpler

1216
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,220
to work with because it only has one parameter

1217
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,220
instead of two.

1218
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,220
So what I'd love for you to do now is

1219
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,220
just have a quick hands-on.

1220
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:21,220
You get to put your first ECDF by yourselves

1221
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:23,220
not coding along. So please

1222
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:25,220
put the ECDF of the Poisson distribution

1223
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,220
that you generated above. And I'll give you a few

1224
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,220
minutes to do that.

1225
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,220
.

1226
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,220
.

1227
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:41,220
.

1228
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,220
.

1229
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:01,220
.

1230
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:07,220
.

1231
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:11,220
.

1232
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:15,220
.

1233
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:17,220
.

1234
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:19,220
.

1235
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:21,220
.

1236
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:23,220
.

1237
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,220
.

1238
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:27,220
.

1239
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:29,220
.

1240
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,220
