1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So, for example, I work with your class, I guess, that are able to participate in the

2
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
class. Okay, I think it is 1.20 now. Can everybody hear me okay? I'm okay on the mic. Awesome.

3
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Housekeeping type stuff, basically this is the 2D platformer tutorial, so if you were

4
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
looking for a different tutorial now is a good time to go find that. The survey link

5
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,680
for this tutorial is up there. I will try to also show it near the end if you're the

6
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,400
type of person who likes to give your opinion after you actually watch the tutorial or you

7
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,520
can jot it down now. Most important, the snack break is from 3 to 3.20 by what I've got up

8
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:29,520
here and help us watch the clock because I'm told if we don't get out right at 3.20, all

9
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,680
the good snacks are gone and we don't want that to happen. Please do share outlets as

10
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,760
well as there are only some outlets here and not everybody's computer can run the three

11
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,320
hours that we've got. In order to get started, a lot of this is online. In fact, there's

12
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,320
some stuff that you hopefully will want to download for this and if you go to that website,

13
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,880
arcade.academy, there's a platformer tutorial link if you haven't already been there and

14
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,340
that has all the notes for the presentation that I'm giving today, so if you would please

15
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:10,580
go there now, that would be great. Okay, how are we doing? Anybody who need more time?

16
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:17,580
Everybody got that link? Arcade.academy and then once you are there, you should be able

17
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:24,580
to see underneath the example code, there is a platformer tutorial right here. You can

18
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,460
see the link to the platformer tutorial. You can see the link to the platformer tutorial

19
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:47,020
right here. See underneath the example code, there is a platformer tutorial right here.

20
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:55,340
That link is the one that we want, so click on that link and then that should take you

21
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:06,980
here. Okay, so that's the platformer tutorial. Now, if you have any questions, please feel

22
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:16,460
free to ask them. Okay, anybody need help finding this? And for the people that just

23
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:29,060
came in, arcade.academy, if you go to arcade.academy, there is a platformer tutorial that has the

24
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:36,340
example code and the download links on it. Okay, this particular tutorial I'm going to

25
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:46,020
work to make sure that everybody can get wired up a 2D platformer game using Python in the

26
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:52,540
arcade library. The tutorial I've got divided up into multiple parts here into a total of

27
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:59,540
nine different steps and each one of these steps at the end of it has a blue note to

28
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:08,460
it and down here like at the end. This note, basically if you're the, you're the developer

29
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,100
if you happen to get ahead or working a little bit ahead and you want to do further exploration,

30
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,540
this has a lot of sideways areas that you can go in order to learn more, but I want

31
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,100
to make sure that everybody gets at least through the core part and once you've gotten

32
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,580
through the core part, if there's extra time, take a look and explore some of those different

33
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:36,580
areas or you can work ahead too if you so desire. Our first step here that we're looking

34
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:43,580
to do is basically make sure that you've got the library installed that you end up

35
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:50,580
needing and also that you've got the downloads, the supporting image files as well to get

36
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:57,780
this up and going and a basic window open on your screen. So the first step, I'm hoping

37
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:04,780
that basically I'm looking for Python 3.6 or greater to be installed. You can, I got

38
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,420
the download link there although I'm guessing here at a Python conference, hopefully most

39
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,420
of you have Python installed, but I do need 3.6 or greater in order to get this to work.

40
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:20,420
There's also a zip file with code, images and sounds from this presentation. If you

41
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,420
click on that and download it, you should be able to expand your library and get a lot

42
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,300
of that and download it. You should be able to expand it into a zip file that will look

43
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:35,460
close to like that directory structure that I've got there on the screen. And the images

44
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:42,460
are from Kenny.NL. He's got a whole lot of really cool images available for doing 2D

45
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:48,260
games that are license free and it's pretty cool if you want to check out that stuff.

46
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:55,100
Anyway, so the basic directory structure should look like that once you get it downloaded.

47
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:01,420
And then you need the arcade library, 204 or greater. Everybody has different ways they

48
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,180
like to manage libraries, but for most people you should be able to type in pip install

49
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,580
arcade on the command prompt or you might need pip 3 install arcade in order to download

50
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,860
it. I've got longer instruction, official installation instructions there. Once you

51
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:24,860
have it downloaded, you should be able to open up a window with the code that you have

52
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:32,100
in the code that we've got up here. This particular code, the primary thing to note

53
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:39,180
here is we are creating our own subclass of the arcade.window class and we will basically

54
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,420
override functions that are part of the window class in order to add additional functionality.

55
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,380
There's not much functionality going on right now, but we want to make sure that we at least

56
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:56,340
get everything downloaded and installed and can get a window to pop up on the screen.

57
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,660
We're setting the background color right here. There are a lot of pre-programmed background

58
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,500
colors and you can take a look at the blue note at the end so you can actually click

59
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,180
on the documentation for this and see what all the different colors are that are available.

60
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:17,980
The CSS colors basically mirror the standard CSS colors you would get for Cascading Style

61
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:22,820
Sheet on the web. Then there's another package with a bit more color in it called the color

62
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:29,820
package. Right, at this point basically then, if you have extra time, play around with changing

63
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,420
the screen size, the title, and the background color. I'd like to pause here and then try

64
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,980
to make sure that we get everybody up and going to have the libraries installed and

65
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:49,980
up and working. There are some scattered Post-it notes around if you would like additional

66
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,660
help, if you want to put the red Post-it note or something on your computer or otherwise

67
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,220
just raise your hand. Then I want to wander around trying to make sure everybody's up

68
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:05,220
and going at this spot. Any general questions? All right, have at it and we'll go from there.

69
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:49,980
Okay, thank you.

70
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:19,980
Okay, thank you.

71
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:49,980
All right, how are you doing? Who has yet not worked on the party yet?

72
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:19,980
Okay.

73
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:49,980
Okay.

74
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:19,980
Okay.

75
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:49,980
Okay.

76
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:19,980
Okay.

77
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:49,980
Okay.

78
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:19,980
Okay.

79
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:49,980
Okay.

80
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:19,980
Okay.

81
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:49,980
Okay.

82
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:19,980
Okay.

83
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:49,980
Okay.

84
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:19,980
Okay.

85
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:26,980
Okay.

86
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:33,980
Okay.

87
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:40,980
Okay, I'm going to look. I'm going to go from here and hit towards the next step. The next

88
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:53,460
goal is to, can you hear me okay? Okay. The next goal is to add in sprites and the sprite

89
00:20:53,900 --> 00:21:00,980
is any sort of interactable object on the screen. The whole history behind that terminology

90
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,500
is kind of cool but anyway that's time for like a totally different talk. So we want

91
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,180
to get the graphics loaded and on the screen. We'll get the interaction going on later.

92
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:19,180
The aspect of putting this on and getting the setup, normally it is a better practice

93
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,780
to not actually create the sprites in your init method of your window class but actually

94
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:31,460
in a separate method. The reason being if you want to restart your game, you can easily

95
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:37,220
just recall the setup method to recreate all the sprites and set up your game. It also

96
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,180
makes it easy if you want to add multiple levels then basically you have a setup level

97
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,280
one, setup level two and so forth. Therefore we're going to end up creating the variables

98
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:51,480
basically in the init method and just set them to blank, zero or none and then actually

99
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,480
initialize them and set them up in a setup function.

100
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:06,240
The main way of creating a sprite for your game is up there on the screen right there

101
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:13,280
where I've got the player sprite being created. We end up using the arcade sprite class and

102
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:19,440
the use of it is really straightforward. You just need a reference to the image that you

103
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,920
end up wanting. In the case of the package that we've downloaded, everything is in the

104
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:30,920
images folder. I like to keep things separated out and there's a player one sub folder and

105
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,560
there's a player one standing. If you don't like this particular player, there's a few

106
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:41,840
other images that you could quickly swap out in that folder as well.

107
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,840
Character scaling is simply a constant number. It's optional. By default the sprite if it's

108
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:53,480
128 by 128 will appear as 128 by 128 on your screen. You can scale that up and down by

109
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,640
giving it a number there in character scaling. If the image is too large, you can simply

110
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,640
do a 0.5 and that will take 128 by 128 and actually scale it down so that it's 64 by

111
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:13,560
64. The 0.5 is what percentage of the width and height, not total percentage area of the

112
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,480
player sprite. Anyway, this creates a sprite. You won't see it yet because we'll have to

113
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,320
draw it but this will actually create the instance of the sprite. Next up we have to

114
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,800
position the sprite. Sprites have attributes for center X and center Y. These are the most

115
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,760
common attributes to use to position it. You just set them equal to whatever you want.

116
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,960
There are also attributes for top left bottom and right if you want to control the sprite

117
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:46,000
based on the top bottom left or right edge instead which can be rather handy at times.

118
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You can set both X and Y using the position attribute if you want. That right there will

119
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:00,200
actually move a sprite to exactly 64 and 120 for an XY location. Once we've got the sprite

120
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:09,240
created, we've got it positioned, the next thing we need to do is add it to a list. All

121
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:15,680
sprites are managed by lists. This makes drawing them a lot easier. It makes also managing

122
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:21,080
and updating them a lot easier. To do that, I'll show you how to create a sprite list

123
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:27,840
in a bit but we simply append it to the sprite list that we've got. The code, in order to

124
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:34,120
actually do this, is right here. I've highlighted the important parts. I've created scaling

125
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:41,120
factors. In this case, my tiles that I've got are going to be scaled down by 25% actually

126
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,040
but half the width and half the height of the original sprite. The character will be

127
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:54,040
its original height. If you do much scaling, it is advisable to make sure that everything

128
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:02,200
is evenly divisible. You don't want to scale a sprite that's 35 by 35 down by half because

129
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,840
the pixels don't line up straight on pixel boundaries and then you end up getting blurring.

130
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:14,480
It's a good idea to try to keep everything evenly divisible when you put this together.

131
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,480
Next up in the init, I've got the lists themselves that I'm going to end up working with and

132
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,680
the player sprite that I have individually pulled out because the player sprite needs

133
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,120
to be moved so we're going to work with it individually. We're going to have a list for

134
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,920
walls, basically anything that the player can't walk through. We're going to have a

135
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,960
list that's going to have just the player in it. It's not much of a list. We're going

136
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,440
to have a coin list, basically anything you want the user to actually pick up along the

137
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,280
way. We'll end up adding that in here in a bit. We're just going to initialize those

138
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:55,360
to none and then down in a setup function, we're actually going to create the entire

139
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:02,280
level. So lines 39 through 43 create the sprite lists. It's pretty straightforward. All you

140
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,920
need to do is a constructor on sprite list and that will set your sprite list up and

141
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:13,200
get it ready so that you can add sprites to it. Then we're going to create the sprites.

142
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,800
There are basically three main ways that you can easily create and position sprites. The

143
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:25,440
first way I've got up there from lines 45 to 49. If you look from 45 to 49, I've got

144
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,440
the standard four lines of code where the first line I create the sprite. Next two lines,

145
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:40,680
I position the sprite. Fourth line, I end up appending it to the list. That's one way

146
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:47,440
of creating a sprite that's pretty darn straightforward. Another way of creating sprites, a whole set

147
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,680
of them is from lines 51 to 57. You can easily create these sprites in a loop. I've just

148
00:26:53,680 --> 00:27:00,680
simply used a for loop here. I'm going to set the X value going from 0 to 1250 and every

149
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:07,600
64 pixels because my sprite's actually 64 by 64 once I scale it. Every 64 pixels, I'm

150
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,480
going to put in a sprite and I simply set the loop up that way, which is a whole lot

151
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,360
more convenient than simply doing four lines for every single sprite you want if you want

152
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:23,360
to create a border. That will give you the basically bottom row of blocks that I've

153
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:30,360
got for the example that I'm showing. The third and final way I'll show you right now

154
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:39,120
on creating sprites is to actually list a set of coordinates and then add the sprites.

155
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,720
Rather than four lines for each sprite that I create, I can do it in one line per sprite

156
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,520
with a little bit of additional overhead. Line 61 through 63, I'm going to create sprites

157
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:55,520
at those XY locations, so 512 and 96, 256 and 96, and 768 and 96. No idea why those

158
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,200
aren't in numerical order, but I never noticed it before now. Then I'm just going to do a

159
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,520
for loop and I'm going to create the sprites and then I'm going to pull the individual

160
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,280
coordinates out of that coordinate list and simply add them. Those are three main ways

161
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,240
of creating sprites. Once you've created the sprite, it does not automatically appear.

162
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:27,240
We actually need to draw the sprites. There's an onDraw method inside of your code that

163
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,960
we want to go through all of the different sprite lists and draw it. The ordering does

164
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,160
matter so the first sprites that you draw will appear behind everything else. The last

165
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,680
sprite you draw will end up appearing on top of whatever you've drawn before. Keep in mind

166
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:51,680
the ordering on that if that particular what sprite appears in front is important. That

167
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:58,920
should give you basically that window that we've got up here for the graphics. Way up

168
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:06,560
here. There we go. You shouldn't be able to move yet, which will be the next step. If

169
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,960
you've got extra time, I would spend a little bit of extra time adjusting the code, put

170
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,040
sprites in new positions, search through those images folder and see what you can find and

171
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,960
practice placing those sprites in different locations. Then I'm just going to go around

172
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,960
and make sure everybody's up and running for this point.

173
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:43,560
I'm going to go ahead and open that up.

174
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:43,560
I'm going to go ahead and open that up.

175
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:13,560
I'm going to go ahead and open that up.

176
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:43,560
I'm going to go ahead and open that up.

177
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:13,560
I'm going to go ahead and open that up.

178
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:43,560
I'm going to go ahead and open that up.

179
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:13,560
I'm going to go ahead and open that up.

180
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:43,560
I'm going to go ahead and open that up.

181
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:13,560
I'm going to go ahead and open that up.

182
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:43,560
I'm going to go ahead and open that up.

183
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:13,560
If you install Homebrew, that's with Pygame?

184
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:20,560
Yeah, mine was with the downloaded version when I tested out and that's supposed to

185
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:27,560
work. Is yours installed Homebrew or is it?

186
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Yes.

187
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,220
For that reason, I don't think the 60 Otherwise, if you have a smaller

188
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,300
system, you actually have a larger display than the 140 it's also relatively large

189
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:42,700
than those and it doesn't help with the Saud самой files that will just make

190
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:47,160
Is yours is yours installed home brew or is it?

191
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:36,980
Okay, next up I'm going to talk about adding user control and if we want to move a sprite

192
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:43,980
around we end up needing to progressively change its center x and center y values. We

193
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,180
can do this but we need to not only keep track of where the sprite is, we need to keep track

194
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:55,020
of a vector of where it's going. In addition to the center x, center y if we keep a change

195
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:02,380
x and change y this is how many pixels are we going to move per frame for our particular

196
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:09,380
character. If change x is one then 60 times per second we should move one pixel over

197
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:17,660
and that will cause our character to move to the right. If change x is negative it will

198
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:24,020
move to the left. With graphic systems, some graphic systems flip the y value, don't know

199
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:31,020
if you've run into this before but in this particular library zero is at the bottom for

200
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:38,940
y and whatever your screen height is is at the top. PyGame actually works opposite of

201
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:44,740
that if you've used PyGame but this is sort of more of a standard OpenGL and the graphics

202
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:49,540
coordinate system that you actually learned in math class type of thing. So zero zero

203
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:54,940
is in the lower left corner, a positive value for change y will move you up rather than

204
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:00,780
down. There's an update function and you can call that on a sprite list which will

205
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:06,780
actually move the sprites according to their change x and change y and eventually we will

206
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:12,060
factor in a extremely simple physics engine class which will just keep you from moving

207
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:19,060
through walls. And the additional code that we need for that, I've got a constant here

208
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:26,060
that I've declared on line 17 for the player movement speed. So if you want your sprite

209
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,820
to move faster just make that a larger number, if you want it to move slower just make that

210
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:37,820
a smaller number. The next set of code that I've added in, I've created a very simple

211
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:43,540
physics engine and it takes two parameters. It takes the item that is moving which in

212
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:48,540
this case will be our player sprite and then it takes the list of things that you can't

213
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:55,540
move through which will be the wall list in this case. If you want to move other items

214
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:00,660
like enemies or that type of thing then you can create physics engines for them as well,

215
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:06,660
you're not limited to that. So if you want to move a lot of things you can create physics

216
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:10,500
engines for them as well, you're not limited to one simple physics engine, you can have

217
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,780
one for each item that's actually moving. This simple physics engine will actually update

218
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:21,660
the player's location and prevent the player from moving through walls. So we put that

219
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:28,660
inside of the setup function here. Then we need to respond to keystrokes if the player

220
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:36,660
is moving by the keyboard and in this case there are two events for the keystroke. If

221
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:42,500
you're not used to working with game type of work you might think of hitting the key

222
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,900
as one event but there are actually two events. One is when you press the key down, the other

223
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:54,900
event is when you let the key up. This will basically change our changeX and changeY depending

224
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:00,580
upon what key you hit. The up, down, left and right correspond to the arrow keys on

225
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:07,580
the keyboard and the WSAD respond to those characters just depending upon which you prefer

226
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:13,500
to move your item around. This will actually work with both and when you let up the key

227
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:20,500
then it will actually set the player's velocity back to zero. Then we've got an update method,

228
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:27,500
this will be called about 60 times per second and it will then update via the physics engine

229
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:34,020
which will cause our player to actually move around. Delta time if you want to take it

230
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:39,020
into account is the time that it took since the last time we actually called this function.

231
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:45,540
It should be about 1-60th of a second by default but you can actually then adjust how fast

232
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,780
the player moves if you want. If there's a system slowdown then the player can actually

233
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:54,780
keep moving at the normal speed if you want to take into account delta time. In this case

234
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:59,780
we don't and most of the time we're pretty reliably being called every 1-60th of a second.

235
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:06,780
So with that you should be able to move the player around the keyboard or around the map

236
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:12,780
and you should be able to not run through boxes. If you're coming from a computer

237
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:17,780
you should be able to not run through boxes. If you're curious there's a better move by

238
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:22,780
keyboard example which is a little bit more complex but responds to the keystrokes better

239
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:28,780
than the simple example that I've got up there right now. So work if you could at making

240
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:35,780
sure that your character moves around by keyboard and give me a shout if it's not moving around.

241
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:50,780
So that's the first one. So the game is going to be a lot of fun. And then the title after

242
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:58,780
the start is not going to be accurate. The higher the level the more accurate the game

243
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:03,780
will be. So that's the first one. And then the second one is the last one. And then the

244
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:10,780
third one is the last one. So that's the fourth one. And then the fifth one is the last one.

245
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,780
So that's the fifth one.

246
00:42:42,780 --> 00:43:05,780
Okay.

247
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:37,780
Okay. Next up is a really fairly simple addition. Adding in gravity. If you are working with

248
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,780
a top down map where the player can basically scroll all around then you don't want to

249
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,780
add in gravity but if you're working with a side view scroller then adding in gravity

250
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:53,780
is basically the next step for that. And I've added two more constants on this. I've added

251
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:59,780
the gravity constant which is how fast your character is going to accelerate down and

252
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:05,780
a jump speed which is whenever you jump how fast is it going to move up. You can play

253
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:09,780
around with these. If you've got low numbers your character will be very floaty. If you've

254
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,780
got fast character or if you've got pretty high values then your character will jump

255
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:20,780
up and down really pretty quick. It's a nice one to explore around with to see if you get

256
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:28,780
the mechanics that you end up liking. Once you've got that then instead of the simple

257
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:34,780
physics engine we're going to end up using the physics engine platformer which will allow

258
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:41,780
you to add in the gravity constant. And there on line 82 I've added gravity and on line

259
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:50,780
80 I've actually switched from simple physics engine to the physics engine platformer. And

260
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:54,780
you can also create multiple ones of these if you've got enemies in your platformer game

261
00:44:54,780 --> 00:45:02,780
that you want to move around. Next up taking a look at the on key press. The important

262
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:11,780
part here in particular is on line 99. Line 99 there's a check in the physics engine to

263
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:16,780
see if there's actually ground underneath the player. If there's not ground underneath

264
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:20,780
the player we don't allow the player to jump. You can modify this and work with it a little

265
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:27,780
bit to allow double jumps if you wanted but this particular update is necessary otherwise

266
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:32,780
then you've got more of a flappy bird game where you can just keep hitting the button

267
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:39,780
and float around. And then on key release we do not set the player's Y speed to zero

268
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,780
when they let up off of the jump because then that just won't work at all. We actually end

269
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:52,780
up taking that out. And that is basically all that's involved in putting in gravity.

270
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:59,780
And if you play around with the numbers on that then you can get it to be floaty or not

271
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:05,780
floaty. So work a little bit with the gravity, play around with the numbers and let me know

272
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:08,780
if you've got questions.

273
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:38,780
So yeah, go to the program and you need your editor to edit programs. And then you have

274
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:12,780
to go to the program and you need your editor to edit programs.

275
00:48:38,780 --> 00:49:00,780
I'm going to get the issue on the right for you.

276
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:04,780
I think it's roughly one of the six that you're scanning out.

277
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:19,780
You need to keep it countered so that when you...

278
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:39,780
A pull request figuring out the...the problem with that though is you've got to be able

279
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:43,780
to...you could reset your double jump. You have to make sure you have some mechanism

280
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,780
that when you touch ground again you reset the double jump counter.

281
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:54,780
You'd have...anyway, it'd be totally doable but you'd have to think about it a little

282
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:55,780
bit.

283
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:03,780
Okay, anybody need some extra help for step four before we go on to step five?

284
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:12,780
Okay, step five is to add the ability to scroll. With step four, if you went off screen, you

285
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:16,780
just plain went off screen, you couldn't see what was going on. If you want a larger map,

286
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,780
if you want the thing to be able to scroll from side to side or up and down if you've

287
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:26,780
got a large 2D map, then the ability to add scrolling is rather important.

288
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:33,780
The new parts with adding scrolling. First off, we're going to set up margins so that

289
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:41,780
if the user gets close to the edge, the camera will scroll. This particular case, if the

290
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:47,780
user gets within 150 pixels of either the left or right edge, it will start scrolling.

291
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:54,780
You can up that or downgrade that depending upon how you like it. The bottom viewport

292
00:50:54,780 --> 00:51:00,780
margin is 50 in this particular example, which works okay for platformers, although actually

293
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,780
50 is a little bit low. If you're up high and then you try jumping down, you won't really

294
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:08,780
be able to see what's down below you very well, so you might want that to be a bit higher.

295
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:12,780
Again, that's totally what you end up wanting. And the top viewport margin basically then

296
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:21,780
covers the top. We need to keep track of how far we've scrolled. In this case, I've

297
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:28,780
created two variables, view bottom and view left. This is basically the lower left corner

298
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:35,780
of your particular screen so that if I've got a huge map like this, whoa, that's a big

299
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:50,780
pen, hold on. So if I've got a really big map like this, and I am not drunk, honestly,

300
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:58,780
then you might have a screen that only shows this part. The view left and view bottom is

301
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:05,780
going to be what point is this? This would be zero, zero, and then this would be like

302
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:14,780
200, zero. I don't think turning off the mic helped there at all. Anyway, we want to be

303
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,780
able to scroll this smaller window around. View left and view bottom are going to be

304
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:32,780
your lower left corner of where that is. The next thing that we add in is this part,

305
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:39,780
which is inside of the update method, and this will actually manage our scrolling. First

306
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,780
off, I create a Boolean variable. I don't want to scroll if I don't need to scroll,

307
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:48,780
so I just set it to false. If anything that I encounter here leads me to need to scroll,

308
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:53,780
then I'll go ahead and do the scrolling. I just check the left boundary, the right boundary,

309
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:58,780
the top and bottom boundary. I take a look at where the player is. I see if they are

310
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:05,780
within whatever the boundary number is, like 150 pixels. If they are, then I need to figure

311
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:11,780
out how far do I need the player to move, which in this case would be like line 146.

312
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:17,780
It basically figures out if you're at 140 pixels and the boundary is 150, it's going

313
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:25,780
to figure out that you need to move 10 pixels over to the left. That will basically trigger

314
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:35,780
the actual scrolling, and then I'll set the changed value to true. Then if I actually

315
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:45,780
need to scroll on line 167, I will go ahead and do the scrolling. Line 170 and 171 are

316
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:52,780
rather important. You can actually set a viewport where you don't have the people line up on

317
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:57,780
individual pixels, but it looks terrible. The computer trying to figure out how to draw

318
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:03,780
a pixel at one and a half pixels, it sort of blurs it and tries to do its best guess.

319
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,780
We really want to make sure that every pixel on the window lines up with an actual pixel

320
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:14,780
on the screen. Therefore, in line 170 and 171, we go ahead and convert it to an integer.

321
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:21,780
Then the key command here, we set viewport. We set the left side of the screen. We set

322
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:26,780
the right side of the screen. We set the bottom, and we set the top. You can actually stretch

323
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:31,780
the screen out larger. You can compress the screen if you want, but this will keep the

324
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:35,780
screen according to the screen width and screen height dimensions in the particular

325
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:40,780
example we've got here, but it will allow us to scroll around the screen.

326
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:46,780
Most of the time when I end up doing games, this logic is pretty well left unchanged,

327
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:51,780
and all you end up needing to do is managing the viewport boundaries. This should allow

328
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:59,780
you to create a much larger world and scroll around in it for your particular game. If

329
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:03,780
you want to make sure that you've got that up and going and give me a shout, if you've

330
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:06,780
got any questions on getting it working, that would be great.

331
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:36,780
I'm going to go ahead and put that here and change the one on the right to 120. I corrected

332
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:43,780
it last time. Now it's 11. Yeah, it won't be back in the wallet.

333
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:36,780
It's basically the scaling of what's going on.

334
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:06,780
It looks like scrolling is a pretty easy addition. Anybody have extra questions or

335
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:17,480
need more time for scrolling?

336
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:24,480
You could still use it with basically viewport, like your viewport margins would be basically

337
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:38,840
huge. I have to think about how you could quickly do that. You would just keep the

338
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:46,040
character at that single spot, and then you'd need to just keep continually adjusting the

339
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:53,040
viewport.

340
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:06,560
Next up, basically jumping around is all great, but we want to end up adding some sort of

341
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:13,560
coins and sound to this for you to be able to pick up. You could do coins, gems, keys,

342
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:18,080
whatnot. In order to do that, basically we've got two things. We need to be able to figure

343
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:23,760
out how to work with sound. Number two, we need to figure out how to work with another

344
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,040
list and figure out when we've actually collided with a coin, because we're not going to let

345
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:35,040
the physics engine manage that for us.

346
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:43,220
The new parts. Lines 55 through 57 load in the coin. The new parts are the ones that

347
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:50,560
are going to be in a sound. Cross-platform sound is really hard in Python. It's one of

348
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:57,480
those things that I wish there was some magical solution for. The easiest way of getting this

349
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:02,320
working is with the WAV sounds, and then you don't have to worry about decoding OGG or

350
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,960
MP3 type of items.

351
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:11,960
For many platforms, particularly Windows, you can get it to work on the Mac, although

352
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:18,960
it's a little bit more difficult. The FFMPEG library will allow you to decode OGG and MP3

353
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:24,280
sound formats as well. For the sake of trying to make sure that this works, we're going

354
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:29,280
to just stick with WAV files. You need to load it here, and then once you've loaded

355
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:35,720
it, you can actually play it later on, which we'll hit here in a bit.

356
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:40,520
Next up, I've got another list. In this case, I'm going to create a coin list. All the coins

357
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:47,520
are going to go into the coin list. That allows me to keep them separate from the walls.

358
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:54,520
Then I need to place the coins. What I've got here on lines 99 through 104 is my coin

359
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:59,200
placement. You could adjust this, place the coins wherever you want, and that will get

360
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:05,400
you up and working with your particular coin placement. You could also end up subclassing.

361
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:10,480
You could create your own coin class and subclass the sprite class, and then easily add in another

362
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:14,960
parameter. You could have some coins that are worth 1 point, 5 points, 10 points, that

363
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:21,960
type of thing, to create some items that are more valuable than other items.

364
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:29,200
Then as far as the sound goes, I've added a play sound on line 128. Every time the player

365
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:34,560
jumps, I already have the trigger for that. Therefore, I can fairly easily add to that

366
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:40,040
trigger the ability to play the sound. I just use that same sound that I created up

367
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:47,040
above. Then the other one I end up working with is down here. I am playing the sound

368
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:59,440
on line 158 when I figure out that I've run into a coin. How do I end up figuring out

369
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:04,520
that I've run into a coin? There's a function on line 150. There's an arcade check for

370
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:11,520
collision with list. This allows me to take a particular sprite as the first parameter.

371
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,760
As the second parameter, I can take a list of sprites. It will then give me a list back

372
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:23,520
of every single sprite that I am actually in contact with. Most of the time, this will

373
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:29,240
be an empty list. You will still get a list back. It will simply be an empty list. Then

374
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:36,320
I can loop through each coin that I hit and process it. Therefore, I am doing that on

375
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:41,880
line 254. I've got my list of coins that I hit on line 50 in coin hit list. I loop through

376
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:48,880
each coin that I hit on line 154. Line 156 will actually remove it from all lists that

377
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:58,040
exist. It basically destroys that coin. Then I go ahead and play a sound. Later on, I've

378
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:03,320
got the comment in there. Later on, I will go ahead and add one to the score at this

379
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:09,360
point when I start tracking the score. Once you've done that, then you should have a game

380
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:16,360
where your player will actually... This should be Coins and Sound. I should be able to right-click

381
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:25,040
and run this. Any day now. Wake up. Right-click and run. I'm going to go ahead and add one

382
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:34,520
to the score. Once you get sound effects going in, your game is 100% better. Definitely.

383
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:40,320
There are some other sounds in there as well. I teach college class. The day I introduce

384
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:45,680
sound is one of my favorite days when I do that. Anyway, go ahead and play with some

385
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:50,480
of the other sounds. Play with the coin placement, the coin pickup. There are other things in

386
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,320
there. If you don't like picking up coins, you'd rather pick up gems or keys or whatnot.

387
01:02:54,320 --> 01:03:01,320
You can play around with that and get your game put together the way you want it. Then

388
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:09,480
the next step we'll talk about is being able to display the score.

389
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:31,320
I'm going to go ahead and add one to the score.

390
01:04:54,320 --> 01:05:01,320
I'm going to go ahead and add one to the score.

391
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:31,320
I'm going to go ahead and add one to the score.

392
01:05:54,320 --> 01:06:01,320
I'm going to go ahead and add one to the score.

393
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:32,320
I'm going to go ahead and add one to the score.

394
01:06:54,320 --> 01:07:01,320
I'm going to go ahead and add one to the score.

395
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:31,320
I'm going to go ahead and add one to the score.

396
01:07:54,320 --> 01:08:01,320
I'm going to go ahead and add one to the score.

397
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:31,320
I'm going to go ahead and add one to the score.

398
01:08:54,320 --> 01:09:01,320
I'm going to go ahead and add one to the score.

399
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:31,320
I'm going to go ahead and add one to the score.

400
01:09:54,320 --> 01:10:01,320
I'm going to go ahead and add one to the score.

401
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:31,320
I'm going to go ahead and add one to the score.

402
01:10:54,320 --> 01:11:01,320
I'm going to go ahead and add one to the score.

403
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:31,320
I'm going to go ahead and add one to the score.

404
01:11:54,320 --> 01:12:01,320
Next up, talk about how to get something to actually move around the screen with you.

405
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:11,760
This is particularly useful if you want to display the score, how many lives a person

406
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,740
has left, if you want to keep a frame, any sort of stat that you want to actually have

407
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:17,900
move around with the player.

408
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:24,900
There are functions which I've got over here that basically, well now I can't get to it.

409
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:31,700
There's a draw text function which will draw text on the screen.

410
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:34,240
These two lines that I have here.

411
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:38,620
This particular, it's a little hard to see without me getting it bigger, but this particular

412
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:43,940
line says, arcade draw text, whatever text I want to display, tells me to draw it at

413
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:49,900
location 1010 on the screen in a white color with an 18 point font.

414
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:56,900
If I do that when I actually run the game, it works fine at the start, but then as I

415
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:03,500
move, the score actually scrolls with the rest of the screen instead of staying where

416
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,500
I want it.

417
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:10,900
It is a pretty easy fix in order to get anything to have a solid position on the screen.

418
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:17,900
In order to do that, switch back to the easier to read version, in order to do that, you

419
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:25,420
need to add in the viewport margin.

420
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:32,420
That's a key point here where I've got the location that I want the text to appear, an

421
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:39,420
X of 10, I then add in view left so that if I scroll to the left or right, it will adjust

422
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:47,340
that 10 based on it, and likewise here, I add in the view bottom so as I go up and down,

423
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:54,660
it will move the text and keep it at a relative location of 1010.

424
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:59,020
That will allow your score to basically scroll around with it.

425
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:06,020
The other important parts of this particular example, up here in setup, I set the score

426
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:13,020
equal to zero, then further on down, I display the score, and finally here, every time I

427
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:25,340
encounter a coin, I go ahead and add one to the score.

428
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:28,580
That allows me to do the score tracking.

429
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:31,180
There's a lot of other stuff that you can add for stats.

430
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:36,180
You could use the length of your coin list and display basically how many coins you have

431
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:39,180
left to pick up in a rather easy fashion.

432
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:46,180
There's the ability to keep an onscreen timer, which is a fairly popular thing that people

433
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:49,260
end up wanting to have.

434
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:55,260
You can also keep a frame per second counter if you want to keep track of how fast the

435
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:56,460
game is running.

436
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:04,460
There's just a fairly large host of different things that you can do with that particular

437
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,460
case.

438
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:14,460
Really, at this point, I'm kind of hoping to give you a bit of a more extended break

439
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:20,460
and talk about some of the other things that you could end up doing and playing around

440
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:21,460
with.

441
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:27,460
If you want to add a background image to your screen rather than having a solid color, I've

442
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:30,460
got an example that shows you how to do that.

443
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:35,460
If you'd like to have a platform that actually moves around from frame to frame, so a platform

444
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:39,460
that you can jump on, ride it up, ride it down, or across, then you can take a look

445
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:42,460
at the moving platform example.

446
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:48,460
If you'd like ramps, I've got another ramp example here.

447
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:53,460
The collision box for any particular sprite is the entire rectangle that the image takes

448
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:59,460
up, which can be problematic in several cases in that if you have something that's not a

449
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:03,460
rectangle, if you've got a sprite that has a lot of white space around it, you could

450
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:07,160
trim the sprite or you could set up a hit box that way.

451
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,460
The ramps example shows you how to do that.

452
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:16,460
This is, though, a lot easier if you use the Tiled Map Editor, which we'll show here eventually.

453
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:19,460
I'm kind of thinking maybe that'll be the after break one.

454
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:26,460
At any rate, the ramp, you can graphically then set up your hit box using the Tiled Map Editor.

455
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:31,460
If you would like to have your character face left or right, depending upon what direction

456
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:34,460
that they end up moving, that's a fairly easy add-on.

457
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:37,460
There's an example that shows you how to do that.

458
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:43,460
And adding in instruction in Game Over screens is a little bit more complex, but that enters

459
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:48,460
into a sort of state mechanic for your game so that your game is either showing an instruction

460
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:53,460
page, the game is over, or your game is actually running.

461
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:57,460
Anyway, you can rotate your game through multiple states that way.

462
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:02,460
My suggestion here is to get the text up and working and then take a look at some of the

463
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:04,460
different examples that are there.

464
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:10,460
You might also want to take a look at, if you actually go to Arcade Academy example

465
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:17,460
there's about 95 different code samples total, but the ones that are most interesting would be

466
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:18,460
the sprite area.

467
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:20,460
It shows you how to actually move the sprites.

468
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:24,460
So if you want the coins just not sitting there for you, but you want them to move around.

469
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:31,460
If you want the coins to bounce around, follow the player, that type of thing, then that shows you

470
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:36,460
how to do it, how to do levels, how to shoot things.

471
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:41,460
Anyway, there's quite a few different examples there that you can also take a look at and ask

472
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:47,460
questions about, and I would be more than happy to discuss with you on that.

473
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:51,460
So that's what's up next, alright?

474
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:21,460
I think on that one, if you go to where the player is, I think the player is on the lower

475
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:46,460
left.

476
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:52,460
You can add code, check the Y value if you want, and in fact later on in the example

477
01:19:52,460 --> 01:20:08,460
I would probably do like a player one sprite.

478
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:12,460
So in this case you need to make sure that you have an auto-replacement.

479
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:23,460
So let's just go up to the view and the sprite area.

480
01:20:53,460 --> 01:21:15,460
Okay.

481
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:37,460
Okay.

482
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:59,460
Okay.

483
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:21,460
Okay.

484
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:43,460
Okay.

485
01:22:43,460 --> 01:23:05,460
Okay.

486
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:27,460
Okay.

487
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:49,460
Okay.

488
01:23:49,460 --> 01:24:11,460
Okay.

489
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:33,460
Okay.

490
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:55,460
Okay.

491
01:24:55,460 --> 01:25:17,460
Okay.

492
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:39,460
Okay.

493
01:25:39,460 --> 01:26:01,460
Okay.

494
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:23,460
Okay.

495
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:45,460
Okay.

496
01:26:45,460 --> 01:27:07,460
Okay.

497
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:29,460
Okay.

498
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:51,460
Okay.

499
01:27:51,460 --> 01:28:13,460
Okay.

500
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:35,460
Okay.

501
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:57,460
Okay.

502
01:28:57,460 --> 01:29:19,460
Okay.

503
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:41,460
Okay.

504
01:29:41,460 --> 01:30:03,460
Okay.

505
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:25,460
Okay.

506
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:47,460
Okay.

507
01:30:47,460 --> 01:31:09,460
Okay.

508
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:31,460
Okay.

509
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:53,460
Okay.

510
01:31:53,460 --> 01:32:15,460
Okay.

511
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:37,460
Okay.

512
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:59,460
Okay.

513
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:21,460
Okay.

514
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:43,460
Okay.

515
01:33:43,460 --> 01:34:05,460
Okay.

516
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:27,460
Okay.

517
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:49,460
Okay.

518
01:34:49,460 --> 01:35:11,460
Okay.

519
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:33,460
Okay.

520
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:49,460
Okay.

521
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:50,460
All right.

522
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:55,460
As we get closer towards break time, basically after break time I would like to work with

523
01:35:55,460 --> 01:36:01,460
the Tiled Map Editor which allows you to basically then paint your level.

524
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:09,460
And in order to do that basically we need to have downloaded the Tiled Map Editor.

525
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:16,460
And if you go down to the step eight for the Use Map Editor program, if before break or

526
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:21,460
during break if it takes a little extra time, if you go to the Tiled Map Editor and make

527
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:29,460
sure you have that installed right there, you should end up with a program that basically

528
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:38,460
Tiled Map Editor and you can download it up there.

529
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:42,460
Make sure you have that up and working on your particular pro on your computer.

530
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:49,460
And then the other thing is if you have eight examples instead of nine examples, I added

531
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:53,460
a ninth example later on, you might want to re-download files.

532
01:36:53,460 --> 01:37:00,460
There's the ninth example and map files that go along with that that might be useful

533
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:01,460
to have as well.

534
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:05,460
So if you have eight examples you might want to re-download those image files in the example

535
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:10,460
code and get that last ninth example and have that ready by the end of break.

536
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:15,460
So the Tiled Map Editor and make sure you've got nine examples and you've got like about

537
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:20,460
seven minutes or so before break time starts and we don't want to miss out on snacks.

538
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:23,460
So make sure you've got plenty of time for that.

539
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:51,460
So that's it.

540
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:52,460
Thanks.

541
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:53,460
Thanks.

542
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:54,460
Thanks.

543
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:55,460
Thanks.

544
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:56,460
Thanks.

545
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:57,460
Thanks.

546
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:58,460
Thanks.

547
01:37:58,460 --> 01:37:59,460
Thanks.

548
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:00,460
Thanks.

549
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:01,460
Thanks.

550
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:02,460
Thanks.

551
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:03,460
Thanks.

552
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:04,460
Thanks.

553
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:05,460
Thanks.

554
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:06,460
Thanks.

555
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:07,460
Thanks.

556
01:38:07,460 --> 01:38:08,460
Thanks.

557
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:09,460
Thanks.

558
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:10,460
Thanks.

559
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:11,460
Thanks.

560
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:12,460
Thanks.

561
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:13,460
Thanks.

562
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:14,460
Thanks.

563
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:15,460
Thanks.

564
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:16,460
Thanks.

565
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:17,460
Thanks.

566
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:18,460
Thanks.

567
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:19,460
Thanks.

568
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:20,460
Thanks.

569
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:51,460
Thanks.

570
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:20,460
Thanks.

571
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:50,460
Thanks.

572
01:40:19,460 --> 01:40:21,460
Thanks.

573
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:50,460
Thanks.

574
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:20,460
Thanks.

575
01:41:49,460 --> 01:41:50,460
Thanks.

576
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:21,460
And as a time check it is 2.59.

577
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:26,460
We will reconvene with the Map Editor at 3.20.

578
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:28,460
So you might want to now take your break.

579
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:50,460
Thanks.

580
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:20,460
Thanks.

581
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:51,460
Thanks.

582
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:53,460
Thanks.

583
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:55,460
Thanks.

584
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:57,460

Thanks.

601
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:31,460
Thanks.

602

Thanks.

644

Thanks.

645

Thanks.

650

Thanks.

651
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:11,460
Thanks.

652
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:13,460
Thanks.

653
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:15,460
Thanks.

654
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:17,460
Thanks.

655
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:19,460
Thanks.

656
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:21,460
Thanks.

657
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:23,460
Thanks.

658
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:25,460
Thanks.

659
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:27,460
Thanks.

660
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:29,460
Thanks.

661
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:31,460
Thanks.

662
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:33,460
Thanks.

663
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:35,460
Thanks.

664
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:37,460
Thanks.

665
01:46:37,460 --> 01:46:39,460
Thanks.

666
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:41,460
Thanks.

667
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:43,460
Thanks.

668
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:45,460
Thanks.

669
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:47,460
Thanks.

670
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:49,460
Thanks.

671
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:51,460
Thanks.

672
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:53,460
Thanks.

673
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:55,460
Thanks.

674
01:46:55,460 --> 01:46:57,460
Thanks.

675
01:46:57,460 --> 01:46:59,460
Thanks.

676
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:01,460
Thanks.

677
01:47:01,460 --> 01:47:03,460
Thanks.

678
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:05,460
Thanks.

679
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:07,460
Thanks.

680
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:09,460
Thanks.

681
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:11,460
Thanks.

682
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:13,460
Thanks.

683
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:15,460
Thanks.

684
01:47:15,460 --> 01:47:19,460
declined

685
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:21,460
1

686
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:23,460
Heh.

687
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:25,460
hasn't

688
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:27,460
Yawned

689
01:47:27,460 --> 01:47:29,460
Yeah.

690
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:31,460
No.

691
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:33,460
Yawned

692
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:41,460
Well, for me it was kind of disappointing in that I did some pull requests and stuff but nothing was happening with PyGames.

693
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:47,460
And then it was very much a Python 2, I mean they didn't use new Python 3 things, which I get, there's a lot of backwards compatibility.

694
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:53,460
And then there's weird, just language things that I would have to explain to students.

695
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:59,460
Okay, here normally with lists you use a pin, but with PyGame you want to add it to PyGame list as an add.

696
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:07,460
And then all the students would like the image scaled down. There's no easy way to scale down the image there.

697
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:12,460
The list went on and on and finally I was like, I just start with something.

698
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:25,460
Yeah, and then I tried playing around because PyGames is backed by SDL1 library and there's now a 2, but even the 2 wasn't that great.

699
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:32,460
And I couldn't do basic drawing commands like draw a line with a width of greater than 1.

700
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:39,460
So that took some, and then basically I just was like, oh, why not just use OpenGL?

701
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:53,460
What I ideally would like out of a platform like this is to not, like one of PyGames' problems I think as you mentioned is that they're so focused on maintaining backwards compatibility

702
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:57,460
that they're afraid to do anything new where they don't want to accept it for it.

703
01:48:57,460 --> 01:49:07,460
I would like for the opposite, I would like for at least over a major burden help or something like that to not be particularly worried about breaking backwards compatibility in favor of doing things like that.

704
01:49:07,460 --> 01:49:14,460
That's generally how I work. The idea that somebody doesn't want to fix a bug is that they rely on that bug.

705
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:16,460
Especially in like a game room.

706
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:27,460
Yeah, I get both sides of it. For the education, if you're using this for education, just simple better naming conventions that are more consistent really help out a lot.

707
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:40,460
And then it's been nice with the type-hinting and some other items with the newer editors with students to allow them to catch errors that they wouldn't have easily otherwise caught.

708
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:46,460
And simple quality of life improvements like f-strings and stuff like that just make general Python variable better.

709
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:51,460
Python 3.6 at least is what I want to use at this point.

710
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:52,460
Yeah, the f-strings.

711
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:54,460
I'll try to use f-strings with Python 2.

712
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:55,460
The f-strings are big for me.

713
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:51,460
Okay.

714
01:50:51,460 --> 01:51:06,460
Yeah.

715
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:28,460
I could see doing that just on a default basis.

716
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:31,460
I mean, you usually add a reset function in there.

717
01:51:31,460 --> 01:51:44,460
I'm trying to think. What's the biggest hint normally goes with on Python? It's a huge number though.

718
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:46,460
Yeah.

719
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:58,460
So you're not going to overflow anytime soon.

720
01:51:58,460 --> 01:52:26,460
Is it just held by a decimal? A decimal? Classes, I'm sorry.

721
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:35,460
The biggest one that I haven't really found an easy way that's a very common pattern is the scrolling.

722
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:40,460
But it would be, you still want to be able to control the camera somehow.

723
01:52:40,460 --> 01:53:04,460
So yeah, that one, I think of the chunk of the most repeated code.

724
01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:15,460
Yeah.

725
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:21,460
So the intention for a game just an educational rule or whatever?

726
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:30,460
I've seen some pretty decent 2D games made out of it by people.

727
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:43,460
I mean, just not advances of regular game engines, but I'd like to see it developed into a lot more potential, quite frankly.

728
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:49,460
Adding in the ability to do lights and a bit more on the whole shader aspect of things would be nice.

729
01:53:49,460 --> 01:54:02,460
It's pretty quick, but it runs into problems in conversion between Python's floats and native floats that whole mapping.

730
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:20,460
If you take it over to the graphics card, that's a big time crunch that I would really like to figure out something better on.

731
01:54:20,460 --> 01:54:31,460
Yeah, basically right now it uses numpy to do the native transfer over to the graphics card.

732
01:54:31,460 --> 01:54:39,460
It's not fast moving numbers from a regular Python number to a numpy number.

733
01:54:39,460 --> 01:54:49,460
I mean, one number is not bad, but if you're doing thousands, 60 times per second, then you start noticing the difference.

734
01:54:49,460 --> 01:55:07,460
If you don't move them at all, then it's like super fast.

735
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:10,460
You can take a look at the history on it.

736
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:20,460
I picked up on a number of people doing bugs in Fork Web.

737
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:55,460
Yeah, it uses PyTest.

738
01:56:55,460 --> 01:56:59,460
There's basically two folders of testing.

739
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:00,460
One's more mocked out.

740
01:57:00,460 --> 01:57:05,460
The other one is a little bit more complete and actually using the OpenGL.

741
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:12,460
There's another one that's not actually a PyTest, but it just runs every bit of example code to make sure that the examples all work.

742
01:57:35,460 --> 01:58:00,460
Yeah.

743
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:27,460
Yeah.

744
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:54,460
Yeah.

745
01:58:54,460 --> 01:59:21,460
Yeah.

746
01:59:21,460 --> 01:59:48,460
Yeah.

747
01:59:48,460 --> 02:00:15,460
Yeah.

748
02:00:15,460 --> 02:00:38,460
Yeah.

749
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:59,460
Yeah.

750
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:28,460
Yeah.

751
02:01:28,460 --> 02:01:29,460
All right.

752
02:01:29,460 --> 02:01:40,460
So if you have a jump speed of 15 and your gravity is one, it'll take 15 frames then to get to the top of the jump.

753
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:44,460
And then you can end up calculating how many pixels that would be.

754
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:47,460
I couldn't do that in my head on hand.

755
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:50,460
Actually, that wouldn't be too hard because then you just have to do it.

756
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:54,460
15 frames, you're traveling to 15 per second.

757
02:01:54,460 --> 02:02:00,460
You just do 15 divided by two.

758
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:06,460
Now I have to switch into a better thinking mode.

759
02:02:06,460 --> 02:02:20,460
But anyway, yeah, then you can calculate that for the top of your jump.

760
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:27,460
Yeah, then your speed goes to zero immediately.

761
02:02:27,460 --> 02:02:50,460
It'll actually set that for you when you hit the top because otherwise it just looks wrong because you stick there.

762
02:02:50,460 --> 02:03:13,460
Yes, then it also gets reset.

763
02:03:13,460 --> 02:03:14,460
I don't think you're used.

764
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:17,460
I have to look again, but I don't think your speed changes at all.

765
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:46,460
And you just simply don't go through the item and just keeps resetting you back.

766
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:52,460
Okay, so keeping the time here.

767
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:53,460
Mike's working, right?

768
02:03:53,460 --> 02:03:54,460
All right.

769
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:57,460
Mike is sliding off me.

770
02:03:57,460 --> 02:04:02,460
Hold on.

771
02:04:02,460 --> 02:04:03,460
Okay.

772
02:04:03,460 --> 02:04:07,460
Please make sure you've got the tiled editor down and working.

773
02:04:07,460 --> 02:04:14,460
And while we're just double checking, make sure that people have got that done and had enough time to make sure that's working.

774
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:27,460
Just as a bit of history, there are, as you may or may not know, several graphics libraries out there for use with Python.

775
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:34,460
The arcade library was actually sort of born out of, I taught using Pygame for quite a few years.

776
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:37,460
And eventually Pygame got to the point where it wasn't being updated.

777
02:04:37,460 --> 02:04:38,460
Thankfully, that's not the case anymore.

778
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:41,460
It is being updated now on a more frequent basis.

779
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:43,460
But it was still very much a Python 2.

780
02:04:43,460 --> 02:04:46,460
Didn't take advantage of the Python 3 items.

781
02:04:46,460 --> 02:04:50,460
Used an old SDL library for the back end.

782
02:04:50,460 --> 02:05:03,460
And this basically, after I taught with this and spent so much of the class working at trying to teach people the oddities of the Pygame library instead of programming,

783
02:05:03,460 --> 02:05:18,460
I wanted a library where I didn't have to do that and it used the new type hinting features and allowed OpenGL use for some faster graphics and eventually some more advanced support.

784
02:05:18,460 --> 02:05:24,460
So that's kind of where the arcade library ended up coming from.

785
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:29,460
So did anybody have issues getting tiled, the program to work?

786
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:32,460
Everybody got that set up?

787
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:34,460
Okay.

788
02:05:34,460 --> 02:05:44,460
Tiled itself is not the most intuitive to get started, but once you're started, it isn't too bad.

789
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:50,460
So to begin with, you'll probably need to create a new file.

790
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:52,460
I'll go ahead and close this one.

791
02:05:52,460 --> 02:05:56,460
And you can either open a file that's already there or you can create a new file.

792
02:05:56,460 --> 02:06:07,460
So I'm going to create a new map here and then to actually expand that out and make it easier to read, I'll bring up the website.

793
02:06:07,460 --> 02:06:17,460
And you need these particular settings in order for the map file to work.

794
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:22,460
There are some other settings that work, but these are basically optimal settings.

795
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:25,460
The map file itself is just sort of an XML file.

796
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:28,460
You can actually open it up in XML and see it.

797
02:06:28,460 --> 02:06:31,460
This says how large the tiles are.

798
02:06:31,460 --> 02:06:34,460
That's really probably the most important part.

799
02:06:34,460 --> 02:06:38,460
All the example tiles are 128 by 128 pixels.

800
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:43,460
And then this also sets how large you want your map.

801
02:06:43,460 --> 02:06:50,460
So in this case, for this example, I've got a height of 20 tiles, which is actually kind of tall, and a width of 25.

802
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:54,460
If you've got more of a flat top down map, you want it a bit more square.

803
02:06:54,460 --> 02:06:59,460
But if you're doing a side scrap platform scroller, then you probably want it a lot wider.

804
02:06:59,460 --> 02:07:09,460
And you can change this rather easily underneath the map settings once you create it so you're not really committing to too much there.

805
02:07:09,460 --> 02:07:12,460
But the tile size, you want to end up making sure that you've got it right.

806
02:07:12,460 --> 02:07:19,460
And you want to make sure that your graphics really are pretty much all the same size or else a tile-based layout just does not work particularly well.

807
02:07:19,460 --> 02:07:28,460
Then once you've got that done, so I'm going to go ahead and create this.

808
02:07:28,460 --> 02:07:38,460
So I've got 128 by 128, and I'll just kick the default.

809
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:40,460
Hit save as.

810
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:46,460
And then wherever you end up saving this, you want to try to make sure that you save it in the same directory as your Python file.

811
02:07:47,460 --> 02:07:50,460
If it's in a different directory, it's going to have a really hard time finding it.

812
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:54,460
Therefore, I want to make sure that it's in the right same folder.

813
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:58,460
In this case, I'm already there, but make sure you select that same folder.

814
02:07:58,460 --> 02:08:06,460
I'm just going to call mind map to, and the extension on these files is TMX.

815
02:08:06,460 --> 02:08:09,460
At which point you end up with a screen that looks similar to this.

816
02:08:09,460 --> 02:08:11,460
You can use the control wheel.

817
02:08:11,460 --> 02:08:14,460
You can zoom in and out.

818
02:08:14,460 --> 02:08:17,460
If you're using it on a laptop, you can probably just use two fingers.

819
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:25,460
And to see how much of the map you actually end up wanting to look at in a single time.

820
02:08:25,460 --> 02:08:30,460
The map by itself doesn't do a whole lot of good without something to add to the map.

821
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:38,460
So if we want something to add to the map, we need to create a tile set for us to actually then paint onto the map.

822
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:50,460
In the lower right corner, there should be a button that says new tile set.

823
02:08:50,460 --> 02:08:54,460
If you find that particular button, we can end up creating a new tile set.

824
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:58,460
I'm going to flip over here where I can zoom in on it.

825
02:08:58,460 --> 02:09:04,460
I suppose I should make sure I follow my same bit here.

826
02:09:04,460 --> 02:09:07,460
Maps are usually generated into layers.

827
02:09:07,460 --> 02:09:12,460
If you double click on the layers, you can rename a layer.

828
02:09:12,460 --> 02:09:18,460
I usually use platforms as a layer that's anything I can't move through.

829
02:09:18,460 --> 02:09:20,460
So any type of wall.

830
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:28,460
You can call it whatever you want, but the example code that I've got assumes that you are using platforms as the layer.

831
02:09:28,460 --> 02:09:35,460
So double click on that, rename it platforms, then click on this new tile set button.

832
02:09:35,460 --> 02:09:39,460
And you should get a screen that looks something like this.

833
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:46,460
Anybody have trouble getting to this spot where we need to double check?

834
02:09:46,460 --> 02:09:48,460
All right, we're good.

835
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:52,460
Okay, the new tile set, you can actually call this just about anything.

836
02:09:52,460 --> 02:09:55,460
We're not really going to end up using this name anywhere.

837
02:09:55,460 --> 02:10:01,460
So just type something in there, and then there are different types of tile sets that you can have.

838
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:05,460
In our particular case, we want a collection of images.

839
02:10:05,460 --> 02:10:12,460
Using a sprite sheet is not supported right now in the arcade, so we definitely want a collection of images.

840
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:19,460
And then it's a lot more convenient if we just embed the tile set in the same map that we've got.

841
02:10:19,460 --> 02:10:29,460
So set your new tile set up box like that, and then you'll get the option basically to work with the tile set.

842
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:31,460
So I'm going to go ahead and do that in my program.

843
02:10:31,460 --> 02:10:37,460
New tile set, my tiles, great, click okay.

844
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:40,460
And then it seems like pretty much nothing changes.

845
02:10:40,460 --> 02:10:48,460
What I've got in the lower right corner are all the tiles that I can use to paint my screen with, except I have no tiles.

846
02:10:48,460 --> 02:10:54,460
And in order to get those tiles, I need to click on the right icon, which actually looks like it's grayed out.

847
02:10:54,460 --> 02:10:55,460
This takes a lot.

848
02:10:55,460 --> 02:10:58,460
This took actually me quite a bit of time to figure out.

849
02:10:58,460 --> 02:11:04,460
But if you click on that little wrench icon, you'll actually get taken to a screen that will allow you to specify your tiles.

850
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:09,460
So find that wrench icon, which would be in the lower right corner of your screen.

851
02:11:09,460 --> 02:11:18,460
Click on it, and then you should get a new screen to pop up that will allow you to add in your tiles.

852
02:11:21,460 --> 02:11:24,460
Looking something like this.

853
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:30,460
Once you've got that set up, we need to hit the plus button.

854
02:11:30,460 --> 02:11:34,460
So these are basically two kind of hidden buttons that you just have to magically know to hit.

855
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:37,460
You hit the plus button, and then you can add in tiles.

856
02:11:37,460 --> 02:11:44,460
And then you can find the images and add all of those images into your particular tile set.

857
02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:45,460
So I'm going to go back over here.

858
02:11:45,460 --> 02:11:47,460
I'm going to hit the plus button.

859
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:54,460
I'm going to go into the images folder for my particular examples.

860
02:11:54,460 --> 02:12:01,460
Let's see, examples, platformer, tutorial, images.

861
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:04,460
And I've got multiple directories.

862
02:12:04,460 --> 02:12:07,460
The first directory that I want to add in is the tiles directory.

863
02:12:07,460 --> 02:12:09,460
So I'm going to double click on it.

864
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:15,460
You should be able to quickly select every single tile there so you don't have to individually add them,

865
02:12:15,460 --> 02:12:21,460
which would get really monotonous by hitting Control-A or whatever the equivalent is with the Mac.

866
02:12:21,460 --> 02:12:26,460
This should select all of the different tiles, and then you can click open on that.

867
02:12:26,460 --> 02:12:33,460
And I also usually hit the plus button, go to the directory with the items,

868
02:12:33,460 --> 02:12:38,460
and select all of those and click open.

869
02:12:38,460 --> 02:12:46,460
You can get a tile set with all sorts of tiles that you can actually end up drawing your particular map with.

870
02:12:46,460 --> 02:12:51,460
So go ahead and do that, and let me know if you have any problems getting this set up.

871
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:41,460
Okay.

872
02:14:41,460 --> 02:14:47,460
Okay.

873
02:14:47,460 --> 02:14:52,460
Okay.

874
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:22,460
Okay.

875
02:15:22,460 --> 02:15:27,460
Okay.

876
02:15:27,460 --> 02:15:32,460
Okay.

877
02:15:32,460 --> 02:15:37,460
Okay.

878
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:42,460
Okay.

879
02:15:42,460 --> 02:15:47,460
Okay.

880
02:15:47,460 --> 02:15:52,460
Okay.

881
02:15:52,460 --> 02:15:57,460
Okay.

882
02:15:57,460 --> 02:16:02,460
Okay.

883
02:16:02,460 --> 02:16:07,460
Okay.

884
02:16:07,460 --> 02:16:12,460
Okay.

885
02:16:12,460 --> 02:16:17,460
Okay.

886
02:16:17,460 --> 02:16:22,460
Okay.

887
02:16:22,460 --> 02:16:27,460
Okay.

888
02:16:27,460 --> 02:16:32,460
Okay.

889
02:16:32,460 --> 02:16:37,460
Okay.

890
02:16:37,460 --> 02:16:42,460
Okay.

891
02:16:42,460 --> 02:16:47,460
Okay.

892
02:16:47,460 --> 02:16:52,460
All right.

893
02:16:52,460 --> 02:16:57,460
Once you've got these different tiles set up, you can flip back to your map editor,

894
02:16:57,460 --> 02:17:02,460
and the tiles are in the lower right corner, and you can paint out what you want for world.

895
02:17:02,460 --> 02:17:07,460
To begin with, I'm just going to throw something down there at the bottom to make sure that I can actually end up loading it.

896
02:17:07,460 --> 02:17:12,460
And it's not a bad idea to make sure it works before you spend a ton of time putting together your particular world.

897
02:17:19,460 --> 02:17:24,460
Then don't forget to save it with a Control-S. By default, it doesn't automatically save behind the scenes.

898
02:17:25,460 --> 02:17:30,460
Then once you've saved the game, you should be able to use the sample code in number eight.

899
02:17:34,460 --> 02:17:39,460
And I'm going to flip back over here to the web where it's a little bit easier to see.

900
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:44,460
This code should be able to load up a map, and the map...

901
02:17:44,460 --> 02:17:49,460
There we go.

902
02:17:49,460 --> 02:17:54,460
On line 90 that I've got up here, the map name is here.

903
02:17:54,460 --> 02:17:59,460
So if you save your particular map with a different name, you can change the map name to whatever your file name is.

904
02:17:59,460 --> 02:18:04,460
And then I actually go through and have two layers that it's expecting, a platforms layer, which is the first one that I would try.

905
02:18:04,460 --> 02:18:09,460
You don't have to have a coins layer yet just to make sure that it's working.

906
02:18:09,460 --> 02:18:14,460
And then at this point, it should be able to load up a map, and then it should be able to load up a map, and then it should be able to load up a map.

907
02:18:14,460 --> 02:18:19,460
So if I run... Let's see, I'm going to go ahead and switch this to map two.

908
02:18:19,460 --> 02:18:24,460
And then you can see if it works.

909
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:29,460
So try to get to the point where you're at least able to see the map.

910
02:18:29,460 --> 02:18:34,460
And then you can see if it works.

911
02:18:34,460 --> 02:18:39,460
So try to get to the point where you're at least able to see the map.

912
02:18:40,460 --> 02:18:45,460
And then you can see if it works. So try to get to the point where you're at least loading the map.

913
02:18:45,460 --> 02:18:50,460
And if you've got the map loading, then you can expand it out. Don't put coins in the map quite yet.

914
02:18:50,460 --> 02:18:55,460
I'll show you how to separate out the coin layer here separately.

915
02:18:55,460 --> 02:19:00,460
But put in the platforms that you want and make sure that that's working. And let me know if it's not.

916
02:19:09,460 --> 02:19:14,460
Oh, right.

917
02:19:14,460 --> 02:19:19,460
So this is what we have here.

918
02:19:19,460 --> 02:19:24,460
And then you can see if it works.

919
02:19:24,460 --> 02:19:29,460
And then you can see if it works.

920
02:19:29,460 --> 02:19:34,460
And then you can see if it works.

921
02:19:34,460 --> 02:19:39,460
So this is what we have here.

922
02:19:39,460 --> 02:19:44,460
Although those look like huge tiles.

923
02:19:44,460 --> 02:19:49,460
I won't get into that part.

924
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:54,460
That part is usually large.

925
02:19:54,460 --> 02:19:59,460
That part is probably not.

926
02:19:59,460 --> 02:20:04,460
So I'll just show you how to separate out the coin layer.

927
02:20:04,460 --> 02:20:09,460
So we have a map.

928
02:20:09,460 --> 02:20:14,460
And then you can see if it works.

929
02:20:14,460 --> 02:20:19,460
I don't think you're supposed to be separating the map.

930
02:20:19,460 --> 02:20:24,460
And then you can see if it works.

931
02:20:24,460 --> 02:20:29,460
And then

932
02:20:29,460 --> 02:20:34,460
I'll just do

933
02:20:34,460 --> 02:20:39,460
that.

934
02:20:39,460 --> 02:20:44,460
And I'll just

935
02:20:44,460 --> 02:20:49,460
do that.

936
02:20:49,460 --> 02:20:54,460
So

937
02:20:54,460 --> 02:20:59,460
.

938
02:20:59,460 --> 02:21:04,460
.

939
02:21:04,460 --> 02:21:09,460
.

940
02:21:09,460 --> 02:21:14,460
.

941
02:21:14,460 --> 02:21:19,460
.

942
02:21:19,460 --> 02:21:24,460
.

943
02:21:24,460 --> 02:21:29,460
.

944
02:21:29,460 --> 02:21:34,460
.

945
02:21:34,460 --> 02:21:39,460
.

946
02:21:39,460 --> 02:21:44,460
.

947
02:21:44,460 --> 02:21:49,460
.

948
02:21:49,460 --> 02:21:54,460
.

949
02:21:54,460 --> 02:21:59,460
.

950
02:21:59,460 --> 02:22:04,460
.

951
02:22:04,460 --> 02:22:09,460
.

952
02:22:09,460 --> 02:22:14,460
.

953
02:22:14,460 --> 02:22:19,460
.

954
02:22:19,460 --> 02:22:24,460
.

955
02:22:24,460 --> 02:22:29,460
.

956
02:22:29,460 --> 02:22:34,460
.

957
02:22:34,460 --> 02:22:39,460
.

958
02:22:39,460 --> 02:22:44,460
.

959
02:22:44,460 --> 02:22:49,460
.

960
02:22:49,460 --> 02:22:54,460
.

961
02:22:54,460 --> 02:22:59,460
.

962
02:22:59,460 --> 02:23:04,460
.

963
02:23:04,460 --> 02:23:09,460
.

964
02:23:09,460 --> 02:23:14,460
.

965
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:19,460
.

966
02:23:19,460 --> 02:23:24,460
.

967
02:23:24,460 --> 02:23:29,460
.

968
02:23:29,460 --> 02:23:34,460
.

969
02:23:34,460 --> 02:23:39,460
.

970
02:23:39,460 --> 02:23:44,460
.

971
02:23:44,460 --> 02:23:49,460
.

972
02:23:49,460 --> 02:23:54,460
.

973
02:23:54,460 --> 02:23:59,460
.

974
02:23:59,460 --> 02:24:04,460
.

975
02:24:04,460 --> 02:24:09,460
.

976
02:24:09,460 --> 02:24:14,460
.

977
02:24:14,460 --> 02:24:19,460
.

978
02:24:19,460 --> 02:24:24,460
.

979
02:24:24,460 --> 02:24:29,460
.

980
02:24:29,460 --> 02:24:34,460
.

981
02:24:34,460 --> 02:24:39,460
.

982
02:24:39,460 --> 02:24:44,460
.

983
02:24:44,460 --> 02:24:49,460
.

984
02:24:49,460 --> 02:24:54,460
.

985
02:24:54,460 --> 02:24:59,460
Okay, if you've got this working,

986
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:04,460
you can add in additional layers.

987
02:25:04,460 --> 02:25:09,460
If you right click on the layer over here, you can select a new tile layer.

988
02:25:09,460 --> 02:25:14,460
And then I'm going to create one here called coins.

989
02:25:14,460 --> 02:25:19,460
That will allow you to add separately things to pick up.

990
02:25:19,460 --> 02:25:24,460
It is extremely easy to select the wrong layer and then have your coins act as blocks that you stand on top of.

991
02:25:24,460 --> 02:25:29,460
And then if you want to add them to the right layer,

992
02:25:29,460 --> 02:25:34,460
you can simply flip them over to the right layer.

993
02:25:34,460 --> 02:25:39,460
You can also add a block of coins that you accidentally end up picking up.

994
02:25:39,460 --> 02:25:44,460
Make sure you select the right one here.

995
02:25:44,460 --> 02:25:49,460
I've got platforms and I've got coins.

996
02:25:49,460 --> 02:25:52,880
There's also a little eyeball thing here on the side, so if you want to make sure you

997
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:56,560
know what's in what layer, you can select those two.

998
02:25:56,560 --> 02:26:02,800
And then once you've done that, you should be able to save it and then rerun this particular

999
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:12,960
program, see the new items, and pick up the coins.

1000
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:14,260
So that's the next step.

1001
02:26:14,260 --> 02:26:16,980
Add in those different layers that you've got.

1002
02:28:14,260 --> 02:28:16,260
Okay, so you can use your fileware.

1003
02:28:16,260 --> 02:28:24,260
So, yeah, right click on the form and then you can use that.

1004
02:28:24,260 --> 02:28:28,260
And then add in the fileware.

1005
02:28:28,260 --> 02:28:30,260
Yeah, now you can do it right after.

1006
02:28:44,260 --> 02:29:04,260
Oh, you've got multiple filepads?

1007
02:29:04,260 --> 02:29:08,260
Yeah, it's like a computer map.

1008
02:29:08,260 --> 02:29:15,260
Oh, yeah.

1009
02:29:15,260 --> 02:29:40,260
Right now the program's set up to always put the person in the same spot, so don't

1010
02:29:40,260 --> 02:30:05,260
worry about putting down the person.

1011
02:30:05,260 --> 02:30:13,260
Okay.

1012
02:30:13,260 --> 02:30:32,260
Okay.

1013
02:30:32,260 --> 02:30:44,260
Okay.

1014
02:30:44,260 --> 02:30:56,260
Okay.

1015
02:30:56,260 --> 02:31:18,260
Okay.

1016
02:31:18,260 --> 02:31:40,260
Okay.

1017
02:31:48,260 --> 02:32:10,260
Okay.

1018
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:32,260
Okay.

1019
02:32:40,260 --> 02:33:02,260
Okay.

1020
02:33:02,260 --> 02:33:24,260
Okay.

1021
02:33:24,260 --> 02:33:46,260
Okay.

1022
02:33:46,260 --> 02:34:08,260
Okay.

1023
02:34:08,260 --> 02:34:30,260
Okay.

1024
02:34:30,260 --> 02:34:39,260
Okay.

1025
02:34:39,260 --> 02:34:40,260
Okay.

1026
02:34:40,260 --> 02:34:44,260
A couple things that you can add in to your particular map.

1027
02:34:44,260 --> 02:34:50,260
If you go underneath the map menu, there's also a map properties.

1028
02:34:50,260 --> 02:34:56,260
So underneath the map menu, there's a map properties, and you can specify the background

1029
02:34:56,260 --> 02:34:59,260
color that you want for your map with that.

1030
02:34:59,260 --> 02:35:03,260
So I am clicking on map, map properties.

1031
02:35:03,260 --> 02:35:08,260
There's a background color, and you can click this and just do whatever particular color

1032
02:35:08,260 --> 02:35:09,260
you want.

1033
02:35:09,260 --> 02:35:14,260
Although keep in mind, when you do the color picker, by default it has things as dark as

1034
02:35:14,260 --> 02:35:18,260
possible, so no matter what I'm over, it's actually still black.

1035
02:35:18,260 --> 02:35:23,260
You need to grab this side thing and pull it up and then get your color.

1036
02:35:23,260 --> 02:35:25,260
And now finally I've got my color.

1037
02:35:25,260 --> 02:35:29,260
So I can get whatever I want for a background color.

1038
02:35:29,260 --> 02:35:33,260
I'm going to make this a bit more pale.

1039
02:35:33,260 --> 02:35:34,260
Awesome.

1040
02:35:34,260 --> 02:35:40,260
And now you've got your background color set for the map.

1041
02:35:40,260 --> 02:35:46,260
The other thing that is really useful is if you've got a particular tile and you don't

1042
02:35:46,260 --> 02:35:52,260
want it to act like a huge rectangle, such as I've got ramps in here, I can go to the

1043
02:35:52,260 --> 02:35:55,260
tile editor.

1044
02:35:55,260 --> 02:36:03,260
I can click on the tile that I want, and then over here, it helps if I zoom in, over here

1045
02:36:05,260 --> 02:36:12,260
on the right side, you can draw a polygon that will act as your hit box for that particular

1046
02:36:12,260 --> 02:36:14,260
tile.

1047
02:36:14,260 --> 02:36:16,260
Zoom out.

1048
02:36:16,260 --> 02:36:26,260
And you can do that polygon by clicking, and it needs to be actually on the polygon tool.

1049
02:36:26,260 --> 02:36:31,260
So if you click on the polygon tool, which is the one that looks like a triangle, you

1050
02:36:31,260 --> 02:36:35,260
can then start drawing around your particular item.

1051
02:36:35,260 --> 02:36:40,260
If you hold down the control key, it will actually snap you into a corner.

1052
02:36:40,260 --> 02:36:45,260
And I'm going to click on this, move this over here.

1053
02:36:45,260 --> 02:36:47,260
Click right here.

1054
02:36:47,260 --> 02:36:51,260
And then I can finally click up here.

1055
02:36:51,260 --> 02:36:54,260
Now this will actually act as a ramp.

1056
02:36:54,260 --> 02:37:02,260
You can put a hit box around the coin so that you don't actually have to get, you actually

1057
02:37:02,260 --> 02:37:04,260
have to touch the coin.

1058
02:37:04,260 --> 02:37:10,260
These particular items right here where you just have part of the item being as a tile,

1059
02:37:10,260 --> 02:37:16,260
if you put a, again, you need to use a polygon around it, but if you click on this and draw

1060
02:37:16,260 --> 02:37:25,260
yourself a box around it, then that bottom part, you won't actually hit.

1061
02:37:25,260 --> 02:37:28,260
You'll move through it instead.

1062
02:37:28,260 --> 02:37:34,260
And once you get your tile set up with all of these different oddities, like this has

1063
02:37:34,260 --> 02:37:44,260
got a bit of an under slope on it, then your hit collisions will work way better.

1064
02:37:44,260 --> 02:37:49,260
So...

1065
02:37:49,260 --> 02:37:57,260
Yeah, basically as soon as you do that shape, it just saves it, but you do have to save the

1066
02:37:57,260 --> 02:38:01,260
entire file, so don't forget to hit file save.

1067
02:38:01,260 --> 02:38:05,260
And then it should just plain work from that point.

1068
02:38:05,260 --> 02:38:07,260
So give that a try too.

1069
02:38:31,260 --> 02:38:37,260
Yeah, that doesn't happen automatically, unfortunately.

1070
02:38:37,260 --> 02:38:39,260
You have to add a code.

1071
02:38:39,260 --> 02:38:41,260
It would be very cool for it to automatically happen.

1072
02:38:41,260 --> 02:38:43,260
Yeah.

1073
02:39:11,260 --> 02:39:21,260
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

1074
02:39:21,260 --> 02:39:25,260
You want to do it basically with a loaded texture, and then once you load a texture,

1075
02:39:25,260 --> 02:39:27,260
you can draw the texture.

1076
02:39:27,260 --> 02:39:29,260
Yeah.

1077
02:39:29,260 --> 02:39:31,260
Yeah.

1078
02:39:31,260 --> 02:39:35,260
Oh, there's not an easy way of representing that file.

1079
02:39:35,260 --> 02:39:37,260
No, not yet.

1080
02:39:37,260 --> 02:39:39,260
Okay.

1081
02:39:39,260 --> 02:39:41,260
Yeah.

1082
02:39:41,260 --> 02:39:43,260
Yeah.

1083
02:39:43,260 --> 02:39:45,260
Yeah.

1084
02:39:45,260 --> 02:39:47,260
Yeah.

1085
02:39:47,260 --> 02:39:49,260
Yeah.

1086
02:39:49,260 --> 02:39:51,260
Yeah.

1087
02:39:51,260 --> 02:39:53,260
Yeah.

1088
02:39:53,260 --> 02:39:55,260
Yeah.

1089
02:39:55,260 --> 02:39:57,260
Yeah.

1090
02:39:57,260 --> 02:39:59,260
Yeah.

1091
02:39:59,260 --> 02:40:01,260
Yeah.

1092
02:40:01,260 --> 02:40:03,260
Yeah.

1093
02:40:03,260 --> 02:40:05,260
Yeah.

1094
02:40:05,260 --> 02:40:07,260
Yeah.

1095
02:40:07,260 --> 02:40:09,260
Yeah.

1096
02:40:09,260 --> 02:40:13,260
So wherever you saved it, is that where you saved it from right here to get to a good load?

1097
02:40:13,260 --> 02:40:15,260
Yeah.

1098
02:40:15,260 --> 02:40:17,260
If you want, I'd love to do it.

1099
02:40:17,260 --> 02:40:19,260
Oh, it just worked.

1100
02:40:19,260 --> 02:40:27,260
See, I was just thinking that you didn't have to do it in the last year, but you did it in the last year.

1101
02:40:27,260 --> 02:40:29,260
So you didn't have to play around with it.

1102
02:40:29,260 --> 02:40:31,260
Yeah, it would be better for its load.

1103
02:40:31,260 --> 02:40:33,260
It just doesn't fit.

1104
02:40:33,260 --> 02:40:35,260
That was actually a good one.

1105
02:40:35,260 --> 02:40:37,260
Yeah.

1106
02:40:37,260 --> 02:40:39,260
Yeah.

1107
02:40:39,260 --> 02:40:41,260
Yeah.

1108
02:40:41,260 --> 02:40:43,260
Yeah.

1109
02:40:43,260 --> 02:40:45,260
Yeah.

1110
02:40:45,260 --> 02:40:47,260
Yeah.

1111
02:40:47,260 --> 02:40:49,260
Yeah.

1112
02:40:49,260 --> 02:40:51,260
Yeah.

1113
02:40:51,260 --> 02:40:53,260
Yeah.

1114
02:40:53,260 --> 02:40:55,260
Yeah.

1115
02:40:55,260 --> 02:40:57,260
Yeah.

1116
02:40:57,260 --> 02:40:59,260
Yeah.

1117
02:40:59,260 --> 02:41:01,260
Yeah.

1118
02:41:01,260 --> 02:41:03,260
Yeah.

1119
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:05,260
Yeah.

1120
02:41:05,260 --> 02:41:07,260
Yeah.

1121
02:41:07,260 --> 02:41:09,260
Yeah.

1122
02:41:09,260 --> 02:41:11,260
Yeah.

1123
02:41:11,260 --> 02:41:13,260
Yeah.

1124
02:41:13,260 --> 02:41:15,260
Yeah.

1125
02:41:15,260 --> 02:41:17,260
Yeah.

1126
02:41:17,260 --> 02:41:19,260
Yeah.

1127
02:41:19,260 --> 02:41:21,260
Yeah.

1128
02:41:21,260 --> 02:41:23,260
Yeah.

1129
02:41:23,260 --> 02:41:25,260
Yeah.

1130
02:41:25,260 --> 02:41:27,260
Yeah.

1131
02:41:27,260 --> 02:41:29,260
Yeah.

1132
02:41:29,260 --> 02:41:31,260
Yeah.

1133
02:41:31,260 --> 02:41:33,260
Yeah.

1134
02:41:33,260 --> 02:41:35,260
Yeah.

1135
02:41:35,260 --> 02:41:37,260
Yeah.

1136
02:41:37,260 --> 02:41:39,260
Yeah.

1137
02:41:39,260 --> 02:41:41,260
Yeah.

1138
02:41:41,260 --> 02:41:43,260
Yeah.

1139
02:41:43,260 --> 02:41:45,260
Yeah.

1140
02:41:45,260 --> 02:41:47,260
Yeah.

1141
02:41:47,260 --> 02:41:49,260
Yeah.

1142
02:41:49,260 --> 02:41:51,260
Yeah.

1143
02:41:51,260 --> 02:41:53,260
Yeah.

1144
02:41:53,260 --> 02:41:55,260
Yeah.

1145
02:41:55,260 --> 02:41:57,260
Yeah.

1146
02:41:57,260 --> 02:41:59,260
Yeah.

1147
02:41:59,260 --> 02:42:01,260
Yeah.

1148
02:42:01,260 --> 02:42:03,260
Yeah.

1149
02:42:03,260 --> 02:42:05,260
Yeah.

1150
02:42:05,260 --> 02:42:07,260
Yeah.

1151
02:42:07,260 --> 02:42:09,260
Yeah.

1152
02:42:09,260 --> 02:42:11,260
Yeah.

1153
02:42:11,260 --> 02:42:13,260
Yeah.

1154
02:42:13,260 --> 02:42:15,260
Yeah.

1155
02:42:15,260 --> 02:42:17,260
Yeah.

1156
02:42:17,260 --> 02:42:19,260
Yeah.

1157
02:42:19,260 --> 02:42:21,260
Yeah.

1158
02:42:21,260 --> 02:42:23,260
Yeah.

1159
02:42:23,260 --> 02:42:25,260
The other

1160
02:42:25,260 --> 02:42:27,260
example I would add

1161
02:42:27,260 --> 02:42:29,260
and it's going to be a good one.

1162
02:42:29,260 --> 02:42:31,260
So if you want to animate that.

1163
02:42:37,260 --> 02:42:38,260
Yeah, there you go.

1164
02:42:38,260 --> 02:42:39,260
That's another one.

1165
02:42:57,260 --> 02:43:02,260
Oh, right.

1166
02:43:02,260 --> 02:43:03,260
Right.

1167
02:43:03,260 --> 02:43:05,260
You know, there were parts of it.

1168
02:43:27,260 --> 02:43:31,260
The half tile doesn't work?

1169
02:43:57,260 --> 02:43:59,260
And it's too good in that order.

1170
02:43:59,260 --> 02:44:01,260
There's two, one has my name on it.

1171
02:44:06,260 --> 02:44:08,260
Yes, that one.

1172
02:44:08,260 --> 02:44:10,260
Draw with that one.

1173
02:44:10,260 --> 02:44:12,260
Right, right.

1174
02:44:15,260 --> 02:44:18,260
Hit the erase button right here.

1175
02:44:18,260 --> 02:44:20,260
And then you can be able to provide.

1176
02:44:20,260 --> 02:44:22,260
Are you going to write later?

1177
02:44:22,260 --> 02:44:27,260
Okay.

1178
02:44:27,260 --> 02:44:30,260
Is that how you do it?

1179
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:37,260
If you don't mind, if you don't look at the most bad

1180
02:44:37,260 --> 02:44:41,260
and short corner, you're definitely on the right layer.

1181
02:44:41,260 --> 02:44:45,260
And then you're getting the right eraser there.

1182
02:44:45,260 --> 02:44:49,260
So I know I'm stuck on the left.

1183
02:44:52,260 --> 02:44:55,260
It's actually in the wrong.

1184
02:44:55,260 --> 02:44:57,260
I don't understand.

1185
02:44:57,260 --> 02:45:00,260
I understand it's not working.

1186
02:45:00,260 --> 02:45:03,260
Yeah, that's what I did.

1187
02:45:03,260 --> 02:45:05,260
Oh, good.

1188
02:45:05,260 --> 02:45:07,260
If you do it a different way,

1189
02:45:07,260 --> 02:45:09,260
then you make it work.

1190
02:45:09,260 --> 02:45:11,260
I do it a different way.

1191
02:45:11,260 --> 02:45:15,260
You can use the flat, you can use the flat.

1192
02:45:15,260 --> 02:45:19,260
This is my theory.

1193
02:45:19,260 --> 02:45:22,260
This is my theory.

1194
02:45:50,260 --> 02:45:52,260
I have another one.

1195
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:55,260
Do you want to go ahead and show me?

1196
02:46:20,260 --> 02:46:22,260
It's weird.

1197
02:46:22,260 --> 02:46:24,260
It's like coming walking.

1198
02:46:24,260 --> 02:46:26,260
I think that's...

1199
02:46:26,260 --> 02:46:28,260
It's in the middle.

1200
02:46:28,260 --> 02:46:30,260
The point on it?

1201
02:46:30,260 --> 02:46:32,260
As much as it is a line there.

1202
02:46:32,260 --> 02:46:34,260
I have it.

1203
02:46:34,260 --> 02:46:36,260
But you can save it.

1204
02:46:36,260 --> 02:46:38,260
I don't know if you have it.

1205
02:46:38,260 --> 02:46:40,260
You have it in the middle.

1206
02:46:40,260 --> 02:46:42,260
I don't know if you have it in the middle.

1207
02:46:42,260 --> 02:46:44,260
I don't know if you have it in the middle.

1208
02:46:44,260 --> 02:46:46,260
I don't know if you have it in the middle.

1209
02:46:46,260 --> 02:46:48,260
I don't know if you have it in the middle.

1210
02:46:49,260 --> 02:46:51,260
Okay.

1211
02:46:59,260 --> 02:47:01,260
Thanks.

1212
02:47:18,260 --> 02:47:22,260
I don't think it is, but earlier down the road,

1213
02:47:22,260 --> 02:47:26,260
it was a much bigger problem.

1214
02:47:48,260 --> 02:47:52,260
So,

1215
02:47:52,260 --> 02:47:56,260
that's a good one.

1216
02:48:18,260 --> 02:48:22,260
Um,

1217
02:48:22,260 --> 02:48:26,260
um,

1218
02:48:49,260 --> 02:48:53,260
I, let's see.

1219
02:49:03,260 --> 02:49:06,260
I have to spend more time looking it up.

1220
02:49:06,260 --> 02:49:10,260
You basically want to take the sprite and then see if it has points that are not corners.

1221
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:14,260
So, you can go to get points, not that it's on sprite.

1222
02:49:14,260 --> 02:49:18,260
And basically you need to find one of those sprites and then call getPoint5

1223
02:49:18,260 --> 02:49:22,260
and see what it actually has.

1224
02:49:22,260 --> 02:49:26,260
See if it's different than what a rectangle would be. And it's different than what actually loaded it.

1225
02:49:26,260 --> 02:49:30,260
And then you need to figure out what the right to steal is going to be.

1226
02:49:30,260 --> 02:49:34,260
So, my guess is that somebody's going to stop loading that.

1227
02:49:34,260 --> 02:49:38,260
The other thing you can do is go into

1228
02:49:38,260 --> 02:49:42,260
maybe you like PyTorch or some other program, go into that

1229
02:49:42,260 --> 02:49:46,260
program load and then you can access it.

1230
02:49:46,260 --> 02:49:50,260
And watch as it pulls in the points

1231
02:49:50,260 --> 02:49:54,260
for that.

1232
02:49:54,260 --> 02:49:58,260
Alright.

1233
02:49:58,260 --> 02:50:02,260
As some additional

1234
02:50:02,260 --> 02:50:06,260
items that one can do. There's a step nine.

1235
02:50:06,260 --> 02:50:10,260
If you don't actually have a program that's like number nine,

1236
02:50:10,260 --> 02:50:14,260
you might want to re-download the items as I just recently

1237
02:50:14,260 --> 02:50:18,260
put this in the chat.

1238
02:50:18,260 --> 02:50:22,260
So, you can go to the next one.

1239
02:50:22,260 --> 02:50:26,260
And you can access the items as I just recently put this in.

1240
02:50:26,260 --> 02:50:30,260
But this expanded example has different layers

1241
02:50:30,260 --> 02:50:34,260
that do other items. It has a background layer

1242
02:50:34,260 --> 02:50:38,260
which the player doesn't interact with, but if you like have a plant or something

1243
02:50:38,260 --> 02:50:42,260
in the background that you want to add that's just for visual reference, then the background

1244
02:50:42,260 --> 02:50:46,260
layer will draw the plant and the player can just basically move in front of it.

1245
02:50:46,260 --> 02:50:50,260
You can also have a foreground layer. This is also for objects that you don't interact

1246
02:50:50,260 --> 02:50:54,260
with. And this will actually be drawn in front of the player

1247
02:50:54,260 --> 02:50:58,260
instead. And I'll show examples of both of those here in a bit.

1248
02:50:58,260 --> 02:51:02,260
You can add a don't touch layer. This could be anything

1249
02:51:02,260 --> 02:51:06,260
like lava or spikes that if the player encounters

1250
02:51:06,260 --> 02:51:10,260
that, it'll just reset them back to the beginning. You could add additional

1251
02:51:10,260 --> 02:51:14,260
code to it like subtract a life, do a game over, or basically

1252
02:51:14,260 --> 02:51:18,260
anything that you want you can add extra layers for.

1253
02:51:18,260 --> 02:51:22,260
I've had questions on like if you wanted a ladder layer where people

1254
02:51:22,260 --> 02:51:26,260
have the physics basically moves different so you can climb a ladder. You could add

1255
02:51:26,260 --> 02:51:30,260
all sorts of layers that act differently depending upon when the player

1256
02:51:30,260 --> 02:51:34,260
encounters them. This code example

1257
02:51:34,260 --> 02:51:38,260
also has

1258
02:51:38,260 --> 02:51:42,260
showing you basically how to reset the player if they end up falling off the map.

1259
02:51:42,260 --> 02:51:46,260
And if the player gets to the right side of the

1260
02:51:46,260 --> 02:51:50,260
map, then this will attempt to advance the level to

1261
02:51:50,260 --> 02:51:54,260
level two. So if you go all the way to the right and

1262
02:51:54,260 --> 02:51:58,260
get to that far, then it will try to load a second

1263
02:51:58,260 --> 02:52:02,260
level. And it will try to load a third level and fourth level. I don't actually have a third and fourth

1264
02:52:02,260 --> 02:52:06,260
level so it will error out in that case. You could add extra logic.

1265
02:52:06,260 --> 02:52:10,260
But this will show you how to have multiple levels and

1266
02:52:10,260 --> 02:52:14,260
be able to load your code that

1267
02:52:14,260 --> 02:52:18,260
way. So the key items to this that are new,

1268
02:52:18,260 --> 02:52:22,260
I have additional layers.

1269
02:52:22,260 --> 02:52:26,260
And the pattern is

1270
02:52:26,260 --> 02:52:30,260
so similar it's really nice to be able to set things up like this. All you need to do is add in

1271
02:52:30,260 --> 02:52:34,260
the additional layers that you've got. So I've got my foreground, background, and don't touch list.

1272
02:52:34,260 --> 02:52:38,260
If only my kids could respect that.

1273
02:52:38,260 --> 02:52:42,260
And then I also have

1274
02:52:42,260 --> 02:52:46,260
a level number.

1275
02:52:46,260 --> 02:52:50,260
And this level number

1276
02:52:50,260 --> 02:52:54,260
I will use to figure out what map I end up loading.

1277
02:52:54,260 --> 02:52:58,260
And I've got a game over,

1278
02:52:58,260 --> 02:53:02,260
which really isn't game over, it's just whenever the user hits something that

1279
02:53:02,260 --> 02:53:06,260
they're not supposed to.

1280
02:53:06,260 --> 02:53:10,260
Then what's new is

1281
02:53:10,260 --> 02:53:14,260
I'm going to do play by play for football.

1282
02:53:14,260 --> 02:53:18,260
I can't figure out these on screen drawing things. I've got a level here

1283
02:53:18,260 --> 02:53:22,260
that you can end up doing.

1284
02:53:22,260 --> 02:53:26,260
And this will change the map that I end up

1285
02:53:26,260 --> 02:53:30,260
drawing. Therefore I can call set up with a one, two, three, four, five

1286
02:53:30,260 --> 02:53:34,260
and it will bring that in as a parameter. And then it's just incredibly

1287
02:53:34,260 --> 02:53:38,260
simple in that down here

1288
02:53:38,260 --> 02:53:42,260
I

1289
02:53:42,260 --> 02:53:46,260
I

1290
02:53:46,260 --> 02:53:50,260
okay, by now, great. I use

1291
02:53:50,260 --> 02:53:54,260
I give up.

1292
02:53:54,260 --> 02:53:58,260
I just use my favorite F strings.

1293
02:53:58,260 --> 02:54:02,260
I hear they have stickers this year.

1294
02:54:02,260 --> 02:54:06,260
And I can easily select what file. So in this case it's going to do map two,

1295
02:54:06,260 --> 02:54:10,260
level one, map two, level two, map two, level three and so forth.

1296
02:54:10,260 --> 02:54:14,260
And then I load the layers. Basically I set up the layers here to load.

1297
02:54:14,260 --> 02:54:18,260
And then down below I end up loading the layers into

1298
02:54:18,260 --> 02:54:22,260
the particular level. The keep in mind levels are case sensitive

1299
02:54:22,260 --> 02:54:26,260
so you don't want to call it background with lowercase b

1300
02:54:26,260 --> 02:54:30,260
if your level name is actually background with an uppercase b inside

1301
02:54:30,260 --> 02:54:34,260
of your program. That can get to be fairly confusing if you don't do

1302
02:54:34,260 --> 02:54:38,260
that case match. And then down

1303
02:54:38,260 --> 02:54:42,260
here I just end up loading the levels. The code's really the same

1304
02:54:42,260 --> 02:54:46,260
for each one. We just do a different variable for

1305
02:54:46,260 --> 02:54:50,260
what layer I'm at and I specify

1306
02:54:50,260 --> 02:54:54,260
which map I want. This

1307
02:54:54,260 --> 02:54:58,260
takes a look at how large the map

1308
02:54:58,260 --> 02:55:02,260
is, the length, how far across it goes and

1309
02:55:02,260 --> 02:55:06,260
I know where the end of the map is which is what I need to figure out

1310
02:55:06,260 --> 02:55:10,260
when I want to advance the level

1311
02:55:10,260 --> 02:55:14,260
and I get to the end of it. Anyway that's basically just an expansion

1312
02:55:14,260 --> 02:55:18,260
of stuff that we've already done before. Then when I draw

1313
02:55:18,260 --> 02:55:22,260
it I want to make sure that I keep in...

1314
02:55:22,260 --> 02:55:26,260
I want to make sure that

1315
02:55:26,260 --> 02:55:30,260
I draw it in a proper order. You'll note that I have the player here

1316
02:55:30,260 --> 02:55:34,260
and the background is drawn first so those

1317
02:55:34,260 --> 02:55:38,260
that whole background layer will appear behind the player and the

1318
02:55:38,260 --> 02:55:42,260
foreground layer will appear in front of the player and that's really

1319
02:55:42,260 --> 02:55:46,260
all I need to do with adding the background and foreground layers

1320
02:55:46,260 --> 02:55:50,260
in order to allow my player to basically pass in front of and behind

1321
02:55:50,260 --> 02:55:54,260
items. Then the don't touch list

1322
02:55:54,260 --> 02:55:58,260
is

1323
02:55:58,260 --> 02:56:02,260
handled down here

1324
02:56:06,260 --> 02:56:10,260
in this section.

1325
02:56:10,260 --> 02:56:14,260
I simply restart

1326
02:56:14,260 --> 02:56:18,260
the player back to the beginning. The second half of this

1327
02:56:18,260 --> 02:56:22,260
the view left and view bottom, it's also important to reset the camera

1328
02:56:22,260 --> 02:56:26,260
back to the beginning. Otherwise you'll reset the player back to the beginning but the camera

1329
02:56:26,260 --> 02:56:30,260
will stay where it was before which will

1330
02:56:30,260 --> 02:56:34,260
make playability a little bit more complex

1331
02:56:34,260 --> 02:56:38,260
if they can't see where they are. So you basically reset the player's location back to the beginning

1332
02:56:38,260 --> 02:56:42,260
you reset the camera back to its original spot and that

1333
02:56:42,260 --> 02:56:46,260
works really well for a don't touch. In this case I also have a

1334
02:56:46,260 --> 02:56:50,260
sound that it plays in addition to that.

1335
02:56:52,260 --> 02:56:56,260
Then

1336
02:56:56,260 --> 02:57:00,260
when the player's X location, so the player I can figure out

1337
02:57:00,260 --> 02:57:04,260
where they are by center X, I can get self dot player sprite

1338
02:57:04,260 --> 02:57:08,260
and I can figure out the location of that player sprite at any time by using center X.

1339
02:57:08,260 --> 02:57:12,260
If it's greater than or equal to the end of the map make sure to always use

1340
02:57:12,260 --> 02:57:16,260
the greater than, don't do equals end of map because the player could easily skip over

1341
02:57:16,260 --> 02:57:20,260
that last number, that's a really common mistake I've had people do

1342
02:57:20,260 --> 02:57:24,260
when working with these games. Then I simply add one to

1343
02:57:24,260 --> 02:57:28,260
my level number and recall the setup function.

1344
02:57:28,260 --> 02:57:32,260
That will load the next map and the player can move forward from there.

1345
02:57:32,260 --> 02:57:36,260
If you've only got three maps in here then you could basically add in extra game logic

1346
02:57:36,260 --> 02:57:40,260
so that if they hit layer three and the end of it

1347
02:57:40,260 --> 02:57:44,260
then you can place a game over on top of the screen. I didn't do that in this

1348
02:57:44,260 --> 02:57:48,260
example but it's pretty straightforward to add in.

1349
02:57:48,260 --> 02:57:52,260
This then allows you

1350
02:57:52,260 --> 02:57:56,260
to do a lot more

1351
02:57:56,260 --> 02:58:00,260
with your particular game. So I'll run this.

1352
02:58:04,260 --> 02:58:08,260
The player passes in front of this background item

1353
02:58:08,260 --> 02:58:12,260
and behind this foreground item.

1354
02:58:12,260 --> 02:58:16,260
Pretty straightforward.

1355
02:58:18,260 --> 02:58:22,260
And like no pressure here.

1356
02:58:28,260 --> 02:58:32,260
And I've got a lava level here.

1357
02:58:32,260 --> 02:58:36,260
Which will just reset the player back.

1358
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:40,260
Which I probably shouldn't have done.

1359
02:58:48,260 --> 02:58:52,260
Cool. Then when I hit the end here

1360
02:58:52,260 --> 02:58:56,260
I've got the exit and

1361
02:58:56,260 --> 02:59:00,260
now I'm on level two. So I've got a background object there, I've got spikes.

1362
02:59:00,260 --> 02:59:04,260
I can add anything I want to the coin level and have it pick up.

1363
02:59:08,260 --> 02:59:12,260
So you can even use those samples. This is a ramp so I've used the collision editor

1364
02:59:12,260 --> 02:59:16,260
to make this into a ramp. This is the foreground so

1365
02:59:16,260 --> 02:59:20,260
I'm just drowning. Help, give me some air.

1366
02:59:20,260 --> 02:59:24,260
And another ramp back down to show you that in action.

1367
02:59:24,260 --> 02:59:28,260
And if you run off the end of the map here it will error out because I don't have a map three.

1368
02:59:28,260 --> 02:59:32,260
But pretty straightforward. Not a lot of extra code

1369
02:59:32,260 --> 02:59:36,260
in order to get this closer to a full fledged

1370
02:59:36,260 --> 02:59:40,260
game.

1371
02:59:46,260 --> 02:59:50,260
Yeah, question if you wanted like a

1372
02:59:50,260 --> 02:59:54,260
continuously jumping type of game.

1373
02:59:54,260 --> 02:59:58,260
Right. You could generate it all at

1374
02:59:58,260 --> 03:00:02,260
once. I mean at some point basically if you just

1375
03:00:02,260 --> 03:00:06,260
wanted it to go infinitely you could

1376
03:00:06,260 --> 03:00:10,260
as the player goes up the ramp you could

1377
03:00:10,260 --> 03:00:14,260
just go up the ramp and just go up the ramp and

1378
03:00:14,260 --> 03:00:18,260
infinitely you could as the player gets near the top trigger the creation

1379
03:00:18,260 --> 03:00:22,260
of new random tiles and it would not be hard then

1380
03:00:22,260 --> 03:00:26,260
to once the tiles at the bottom fall off remove those

1381
03:00:26,260 --> 03:00:30,260
from play just like you remove the coins. And that could

1382
03:00:30,260 --> 03:00:34,260
allow you to infinitely basically move upwards.

1383
03:00:34,260 --> 03:00:38,260
The arcade library itself

1384
03:00:38,260 --> 03:00:42,260
can actually, depending upon the graphics card, you can have about

1385
03:00:42,260 --> 03:00:46,260
400,000 stationary sprites at a time before you start getting slow

1386
03:00:46,260 --> 03:00:50,260
down. Your computer will turn into a heater before then.

1387
03:00:50,260 --> 03:00:54,260
But you can have quite a few sprites actually created even if they're

1388
03:00:54,260 --> 03:00:58,260
off screen. But

1389
03:00:58,260 --> 03:01:02,260
it's totally possible to dynamically put those sprites in and out

1390
03:01:02,260 --> 03:01:06,260
at a time.

1391
03:01:06,260 --> 03:01:10,260
Other questions on the library?

1392
03:01:10,260 --> 03:01:14,260
Right, so to figure out

1393
03:01:14,260 --> 03:01:18,260
the logic behind if you should remove it into a continuously

1394
03:01:18,260 --> 03:01:22,260
upward jumping you'd look at the player center X and the player center

1395
03:01:22,260 --> 03:01:26,260
Y coordinates and then basically

1396
03:01:26,260 --> 03:01:30,260
you could loop through every sprite that you've got in the game

1397
03:01:30,260 --> 03:01:34,260
for wall in wall list and if that

1398
03:01:34,260 --> 03:01:38,260
sprites center X you could loop

1399
03:01:38,260 --> 03:01:42,260
sprites center X is so far below the

1400
03:01:42,260 --> 03:01:46,260
player's center X then you simply just do a remove

1401
03:01:46,260 --> 03:01:50,260
on that sprite and then it goes away. And that will keep you to a

1402
03:01:50,260 --> 03:01:54,260
very manageable number of sprites. And you could

1403
03:01:54,260 --> 03:01:58,260
do that going up, you could do that going down. There are

1404
03:01:58,260 --> 03:02:02,260
procedurally generated examples in

1405
03:02:02,260 --> 03:02:06,260
the example list. So let me get over there.

1406
03:02:06,260 --> 03:02:10,260
Example code.

1407
03:02:10,260 --> 03:02:14,260
And

1408
03:02:14,260 --> 03:02:18,260
right.

1409
03:02:18,260 --> 03:02:22,260
These can hold quite a few

1410
03:02:22,260 --> 03:02:26,260
different sprites. We particularly consider each one of those as an individual block.

1411
03:02:26,260 --> 03:02:30,260
But this shows you an example of creating mazes two

1412
03:02:30,260 --> 03:02:34,260
different ways. A recursive maze uses a recursive algorithm

1413
03:02:34,260 --> 03:02:38,260
in order to divide up the maze. A depth first search

1414
03:02:38,260 --> 03:02:42,260
type of maze. They produce very different types. One has really

1415
03:02:42,260 --> 03:02:46,260
long passages and the other one doesn't. If you

1416
03:02:46,260 --> 03:02:50,260
use the cellular autonomous type of algorithm you can create

1417
03:02:50,260 --> 03:02:54,260
cave type items. This is the, if you've ever played Terraria

1418
03:02:54,260 --> 03:02:58,260
where you've got this style of layout they use a very similar

1419
03:02:58,260 --> 03:03:02,260
logic and procedurally generating their item.

1420
03:03:02,260 --> 03:03:06,260
Binary space partitioning. I love doing procedural

1421
03:03:06,260 --> 03:03:10,260
types of layouts. But that's if you have more of a dungeon

1422
03:03:10,260 --> 03:03:14,260
and you want to make sure all of the rooms are connected up. You can create

1423
03:03:14,260 --> 03:03:18,260
quite a few games or quite a few randomly generated

1424
03:03:18,260 --> 03:03:22,260
levels that way. Other particular items to make

1425
03:03:22,260 --> 03:03:26,260
sure to sort of show or talk about. Adding

1426
03:03:26,260 --> 03:03:30,260
in enemies is not too difficult. There's an example for how to

1427
03:03:30,260 --> 03:03:34,260
do that. How to,

1428
03:03:34,260 --> 03:03:38,260
yes, if you want to shoot things there are, all you need is

1429
03:03:38,260 --> 03:03:42,260
a bullet list basically. So another sprite list that manages bullets.

1430
03:03:42,260 --> 03:03:46,260
And then there are a whole series of examples. One, the simplest one

1431
03:03:46,260 --> 03:03:50,260
is just to have bullets always go upwards and

1432
03:03:50,260 --> 03:03:54,260
shoot coins. Then a slightly more complex one

1433
03:03:54,260 --> 03:03:58,260
is to aim the bullets. This is where you actually end up needing

1434
03:03:58,260 --> 03:04:02,260
to use a little bit of trig because you've got to use sine and cosine to figure out

1435
03:04:02,260 --> 03:04:06,260
what your vector is in order to get to that final location.

1436
03:04:06,260 --> 03:04:10,260
Or you can use the programmer's favorite three keys of Control C and

1437
03:04:10,260 --> 03:04:14,260
Control V in order to just copy the code rather than

1438
03:04:14,260 --> 03:04:18,260
remember your geometry. Having the

1439
03:04:18,260 --> 03:04:22,260
enemies shoot and having them randomly shoot.

1440
03:04:22,260 --> 03:04:26,260
A common pattern is to actually keep a frame

1441
03:04:26,260 --> 03:04:30,260
counter. So you've got an attribute inside of the game

1442
03:04:30,260 --> 03:04:34,260
class that's simply an integer. You start it at zero and then every time

1443
03:04:34,260 --> 03:04:38,260
you call update you add one to it. If you use the

1444
03:04:38,260 --> 03:04:42,260
modulus to see if it's operated, see if it's evenly divisible. So

1445
03:04:42,260 --> 03:04:46,260
if you do frame count modulus 60 then every time it's evenly

1446
03:04:46,260 --> 03:04:50,260
divisible by 60 that's going to equal zero. And that will allow you to

1447
03:04:50,260 --> 03:04:54,260
have something shoot one time per second. Or 120 would be

1448
03:04:54,260 --> 03:04:58,260
two seconds since it's 60 frames per second. That's a nice way of doing

1449
03:04:58,260 --> 03:05:02,260
periodic shooting. Or you can use the random number generator and just

1450
03:05:02,260 --> 03:05:06,260
randomly one out of every 60 see if they end up

1451
03:05:06,260 --> 03:05:10,260
shooting if you don't want it to be as predictable.

1452
03:05:10,260 --> 03:05:14,260
The have enemies aim at the player example again uses a little bit

1453
03:05:14,260 --> 03:05:18,260
of trig. It's very similar to the one up above. And sprite

1454
03:05:18,260 --> 03:05:22,260
explosions shows you how

1455
03:05:22,260 --> 03:05:26,260
to basically animate items frame by frame. So you've got a sprite

1456
03:05:26,260 --> 03:05:30,260
and then you're going to flip through a whole bunch of frames. There's actually a really cool

1457
03:05:30,260 --> 03:05:34,260
website out there. I forget the name of it but it's in the example

1458
03:05:34,260 --> 03:05:38,260
that will allow you to generate explosions. I mean what more could you want out of

1459
03:05:38,260 --> 03:05:42,260
a website, right? And then it will

1460
03:05:42,260 --> 03:05:46,260
let you download each of the individual images that make up the explosion.

1461
03:05:46,260 --> 03:05:50,260
And you just simply flip through those different images.

1462
03:05:50,260 --> 03:05:54,260
And another very similar example

1463
03:05:54,260 --> 03:05:58,260
right here

1464
03:05:58,260 --> 03:06:02,260
covers some of the

1465
03:06:02,260 --> 03:06:06,260
basics on actually having the user move around

1466
03:06:06,260 --> 03:06:10,260
with a little bit of animation in it.

1467
03:06:10,260 --> 03:06:14,260
And I need to get an example with the physics engine

1468
03:06:14,260 --> 03:06:18,260
as well as I've been told.

1469
03:06:18,260 --> 03:06:22,260
So we've got those as particular examples. Tetris is always popular

1470
03:06:22,260 --> 03:06:26,260
so you've got to have Tetris. If you really want a full fledged

1471
03:06:26,260 --> 03:06:30,260
physics engine, the physics engine that we have is incredibly

1472
03:06:30,260 --> 03:06:34,260
simple and straight forward. PyMonk is

1473
03:06:34,260 --> 03:06:38,260
a wonderful library that does a full 2D

1474
03:06:38,260 --> 03:06:42,260
game engine, basically a 2D physics engine inside

1475
03:06:42,260 --> 03:06:46,260
of it. And I can kind of show you that a little bit.

1476
03:06:46,260 --> 03:06:50,260
So I'm going to go ahead and show you the PyMonk examples.

1477
03:06:58,260 --> 03:07:02,260
So you can basically, this example lets me grab

1478
03:07:02,260 --> 03:07:06,260
a box and move it around. I can toss things over, I can shoot

1479
03:07:06,260 --> 03:07:10,260
stuff. So anyway, I love PyMonk and it's very

1480
03:07:10,260 --> 03:07:14,260
straightforward to implement with the

1481
03:07:14,260 --> 03:07:18,260
arcade library. It is however physics, so you have to

1482
03:07:18,260 --> 03:07:22,260
think about mass, weight, and a bunch of other particular

1483
03:07:22,260 --> 03:07:26,260
items on friction when you put this together. But you can

1484
03:07:26,260 --> 03:07:30,260
create some pretty interesting items.

1485
03:07:30,260 --> 03:07:34,260
You can also create

1486
03:07:34,260 --> 03:07:38,260
joints. I think I hit the wrong

1487
03:07:38,260 --> 03:07:42,260
button. I don't know what happened. Try again.

1488
03:07:44,260 --> 03:07:48,260
There we go. I can

1489
03:07:48,260 --> 03:07:52,260
do a,

1490
03:07:52,260 --> 03:07:56,260
and I want circles.

1491
03:08:04,260 --> 03:08:08,260
So I can join these together.

1492
03:08:08,260 --> 03:08:12,260
Oop, don't hit that button.

1493
03:08:14,260 --> 03:08:18,260
So you can join multiple items together.

1494
03:08:18,260 --> 03:08:22,260
Let me try this again. Pin joint,

1495
03:08:22,260 --> 03:08:26,260
one, two, two, two.

1496
03:08:30,260 --> 03:08:34,260
Then I can drag them around

1497
03:08:34,260 --> 03:08:38,260
as well.

1498
03:08:38,260 --> 03:08:42,260
Anyway, you can do fun stuff. It can add motors, that type of

1499
03:08:42,260 --> 03:08:46,260
thing. There's a lot that's possible. The simple physics engine

1500
03:08:46,260 --> 03:08:50,260
is good enough to get started with, but if you want to create something

1501
03:08:50,260 --> 03:08:54,260
really advanced, PyMonk is an awesome library to

1502
03:08:54,260 --> 03:08:58,260
join up with this.

1503
03:08:58,260 --> 03:09:02,260
There's a start of a particle system.

1504
03:09:02,260 --> 03:09:06,260
There are some different stress

1505
03:09:06,260 --> 03:09:10,260
tests if you really want to play around with items. You can do

1506
03:09:10,260 --> 03:09:14,260
full screen as well. There's an example that shows you how to do

1507
03:09:14,260 --> 03:09:18,260
that. Doing a background image. So if you don't want a solid color,

1508
03:09:18,260 --> 03:09:22,260
you can do a background image. There are examples showing you

1509
03:09:22,260 --> 03:09:26,260
how to do a timer on screen. There's also a full-fledged

1510
03:09:26,260 --> 03:09:30,260
asteroid example if you're not interested in doing a platformer.

1511
03:09:30,260 --> 03:09:34,260
Then that example

1512
03:09:40,260 --> 03:09:44,260
shows you a little bit on how to do fade out.

1513
03:09:44,260 --> 03:09:48,260
This, when you shoot it, it actually ends up creating

1514
03:09:48,260 --> 03:09:52,260
additional sprites for the smaller

1515
03:09:52,260 --> 03:09:56,260
rocks.

1516
03:10:04,260 --> 03:10:08,260
Anyway, there's a lot of different examples on that particular website to give you an idea

1517
03:10:08,260 --> 03:10:12,260
of the things that you can do and building blocks to go

1518
03:10:12,260 --> 03:10:16,260
from there. Any general questions?

1519
03:10:28,260 --> 03:10:32,260
Goal in the future on the library?

1520
03:10:32,260 --> 03:10:36,260
Basically, I'm hoping that

1521
03:10:36,260 --> 03:10:40,260
more work is done on shaders so that you can have lights as well. It's not

1522
03:10:40,260 --> 03:10:44,260
all particularly lit up. Performance improvements

1523
03:10:44,260 --> 03:10:48,260
right now. Stationary sprites

1524
03:10:48,260 --> 03:10:52,260
draw incredibly fast. The moving sprites you're limited to about

1525
03:10:52,260 --> 03:10:56,260
I forget what it is, like 2000 or so before it starts to

1526
03:10:56,260 --> 03:11:00,260
slow down. The other thing is sound support is

1527
03:11:00,260 --> 03:11:04,260
the, probably McKeeley's Heel that I would really like to see

1528
03:11:04,260 --> 03:11:08,260
improved. But just Python in general. Pygame uses

1529
03:11:08,260 --> 03:11:12,260
a really old library called AVlib that hasn't been updated in forever.

1530
03:11:12,260 --> 03:11:16,260
This is using FFmpeg libraries, which can be a little bit problematic

1531
03:11:16,260 --> 03:11:20,260
from system to system to make sure that they end up loading. There are some other

1532
03:11:20,260 --> 03:11:24,260
libraries out there that are sort of on the research queue.

1533
03:11:24,260 --> 03:11:28,260
That would be a huge load to try to figure out

1534
03:11:28,260 --> 03:11:32,260
better overall sound support, particularly with callbacks so that you can

1535
03:11:32,260 --> 03:11:36,260
play background music in the games and then when it's done playing background

1536
03:11:36,260 --> 03:11:40,260
music you can queue up the next song as well. That would be

1537
03:11:40,260 --> 03:11:44,260
a big improvement. So, I don't know, we'll see.

1538
03:11:44,260 --> 03:11:48,260
It depends on what people contribute to. The whole particle system was contributed

1539
03:11:48,260 --> 03:11:52,260
by somebody else because they cared about the particle emitters

1540
03:11:52,260 --> 03:11:56,260
and being able to do that.

1541
03:12:02,260 --> 03:12:06,260
Is there anything

1542
03:12:06,260 --> 03:12:10,260
regarding fluid mechanics?

1543
03:12:10,260 --> 03:12:14,260
Is there anything regarding fluid mechanics?

1544
03:12:14,260 --> 03:12:18,260
I would think probably not. You'd need to look

1545
03:12:18,260 --> 03:12:22,260
at the Pymunk library and

1546
03:12:22,260 --> 03:12:26,260
see if they've got anything like it. They might

1547
03:12:26,260 --> 03:12:30,260
actually, because then, my recollection is that you kind of end up

1548
03:12:30,260 --> 03:12:34,260
creating a whole bunch of circles with some soft bonds between the two and then

1549
03:12:34,260 --> 03:12:38,260
you just kind of draw over it.

1550
03:12:38,260 --> 03:12:42,260
For the arcade library itself, no, but take a look at the Pymunk

1551
03:12:42,260 --> 03:12:46,260
library and see if it's got something fluid-like

1552
03:12:46,260 --> 03:12:50,260
on it.

1553
03:12:50,260 --> 03:12:54,260
Any other questions?

1554
03:12:54,260 --> 03:12:58,260
Okay, at this point I will

1555
03:12:58,260 --> 03:13:02,260
stick around for as long as people want to stick around and take a look

1556
03:13:02,260 --> 03:13:06,260
at that other ninth example that's a little bit fancier. You can edit the maps that are

1557
03:13:06,260 --> 03:13:10,260
already there. You can create your own maps. There's quite a bit

1558
03:13:10,260 --> 03:13:14,260
that you can do with that final example and the multiple layers that it's got.

1559
03:13:14,260 --> 03:13:18,260
So, thank you very much.

1560
03:13:18,260 --> 03:13:22,260
Applause
