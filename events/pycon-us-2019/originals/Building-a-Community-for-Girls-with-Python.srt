1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
And I'm Jessica. I'm a physics teacher from Connecticut and I've taught girls who code in various different areas.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:17,500
The motivation for our talk and for running a code specifically for girls is because studies by NCWID,

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:24,500
which is the National Council of Women in Technology, have shown a variety of motivational aspects

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,000
that can be different than what traditional classrooms tend to see.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:36,500
One is that women would like to see the ability of technology to help them help society.

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,000
They feel welcomed when there are a lot of projects and a lot of collaboration as opposed to a lecture style.

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,000
And they want to be able to take risks. They want to be able to make mistakes.

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:56,000
And it's also really important that women have accurate knowledge about what computing careers look like.

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,500
These are obviously not the only issues that the gender gap in computing faces,

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,000
but they are contributing factors that we hope we can help with.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,500
So as many girls get discouraged from doing computer science as early as middle school,

12
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,500
we really wanted to focus on building a community for these younger girls.

13
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,500
We're going to talk about our experiences, so there are many, many, many resources out there.

14
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
These are ones specifically that we have used.

15
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Some of our goals were building a community, building self-confidence, and helping bridge the gender gap.

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
So we broke this talk into three different parts.

17
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,500
First is getting started in code and Python, so what we use that we found useful.

18
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Working with local communities and logistics on how we were able to successfully create a club.

19
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,000
And then we want to prepare these girls for a career in computer science,

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,500
so we really want to build their confidence and curiosity beyond this club.

21
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
So getting started with code and Python.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So when I first learned computer science, it was a screen, it was just very typing,

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
it wouldn't work because there was never a semicolon, and there was a really steep learning curve.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So when you're trying to get girls interested in middle school, that's not really going to work.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So you need to make programming fun for all ages.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
These girls often come in with no knowledge of programming.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
They don't understand that the program does exactly what you tell it to do, and that's it.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So that's definitely a struggle.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They don't understand that there are bugs.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,500
Is there something around, like what do you mean a bug?

31
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
They don't understand basic variables.

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Some of them haven't even taken algebra yet, so that's a way that we connect,

33
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,500
we can teach that concept, but they don't even know what that is.

34
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,500
And then different words like control structure, program flow, syntax,

35
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
those are all foreign concepts to them.

36
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,500
So as I think most of us probably know, Scratch is a great resource for this.

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
It's a very user-friendly environment.

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,500
It's a click and drag, so there's no typing, there's no really chance for syntax errors.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
There's this little sprite that will do whatever it tells.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's very colorful, very user-friendly, kids especially like because you can include your own images,

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
so they can make it about their own room or whatever they're interested in.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
With Scratch, you can also create pretty complex programs.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,500
So this is an example of three of my girls did over the summer.

44
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,000
They created a maze game using Scratch, and here they had like a day where they planned the project,

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and then they created a minimal viable product,

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,500
and then they created all these different levels and all these different complex code,

47
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
and this is just a small image of it.

48
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,500
So they created a timer, used control, so really a pretty complex project that they had a week to do,

49
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,500
and so Scratch is great with those types of projects.

50
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,000
Other resources are like code.org, so my school put on the Hour of Code,

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,500
where students from every, for the entire school, tried to different programs.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So this is just an example of Anna and Elsa, where they really like make it a game to make Elsa behave in certain ways.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
They have a lot of different examples on code.org.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Some are like more for Minecraft, they have age recommendations.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
My students like doing this one where you can make a little sprite dance and it's a different music,

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and they really enjoyed that.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So it's really a lot of opportunities for students to do whatever they find interesting.

58
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Beyond some drag and drop programs, there's a variety of ways you can get kids out of their seats

59
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:21,500
and moving with technology that we found was good as far as like bringing kids together in an after school program

60
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,500
where they're not necessarily all from the same school and don't know each other that well right away.

61
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,500
So games like, when you're illustrating if statements, play a game of Simon Says,

62
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,500
and they'll realize that if you do something, you do something else, but not if you don't.

63
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,000
If you don't say Simon Says, do not touch your nose, that kind of thing.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So another big one was variables.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We found that especially with girls that are middle school and younger, teaching variables was pretty difficult.

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So our favorite way of illustrating that was with a cup, a sticky note on the outside that has the variable name,

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and a crumpled up piece of paper on the inside that has a variable value.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So kids had fun with that kind of thing too.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Codesters is something that Meg already talked about, and we found that it actually works really well for after school programs

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,500
that might have inconsistent attendance.

71
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,500
So Codesters, which she mentioned earlier, has a drag and drop element,

72
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Python code, as well as sprites and characters that you make move with the Python code.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So the reason that Codesters worked so well, we thought, is because kids can see the response of characters right away,

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
they learn how to fix bugs, and they learn what a bug actually is,

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
as well as because it's individual lesson plans, students that might not show up every week or skip a week inconsistently

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
can pick up where they left off.

77
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,500
It's also really great for a wide range of instructor experience levels,

78
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:02,500
because our instructors range from professional coders and software engineers to new coders.

79
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,500
So the fact that every lesson has instructions that students need to follow

80
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:14,500
means that new instructors can read the instructions along with the students.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
One example of a really cool game that some of our students made with Codesters

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
was they wanted to make an environment-themed game featuring cleaning up the ocean.

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So this was something that they had a lot of fun with, I thought, and this was actually made by fifth graders.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The students had fun with this because they were able to come up with a minimum viable product

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
of, oh, we want the quiz to have at least three questions.

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
They were able to come up with advanced ideas like, okay, we want an advanced version of the game

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and an easy version of the game, and it worked pretty well for the fact that they can customize what they want.

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So the last thing as far as teaching kids Python themselves is

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
there's a lot of advantages to starting with a debugger, and the spider has a great one,

90
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and if you're not able to use spider and you have to use something like Jupyter Notebooks,

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
then PythonTutor.com will let you copy-paste code in and watch it execute,

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
which is great especially for stuff like lists and pointers.

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It'll have actual arrows.

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And this resource is good if you're Chromebooks and you can't download Python, it's available online.

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So our club of Girls Who Code had a pretty wide range of skill sets.

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We had students on Scratch and we had students that wanted to learn like true code

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
because they wanted to take AP Computer Science the next year.

98
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So what worked for us was keeping a spreadsheet of where each student was and updating it weekly.

99
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The other thing that we had them do is we had them use a Kanban board where they had like a to-do column,

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
a doing column, and a done column.

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So they had fun moving their sticky notes across the board and keeping track of their own progress as well.

102
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This helped us get ready for final presentations, which we'll talk more about in a minute.

103
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And it also allows a lot of flexibility.

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If you have drop-in volunteers that are coming in for one week,

105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
then they can help a student that they think they have knowledge about how to help them.

106
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah, so now we'll talk about like the other aspect beyond just like helping students learn code.

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The perhaps bigger one is like getting a community together, getting the logistics handled.

108
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So what worked for me because I was a software engineer when I was looking for a community to join

109
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
is that I was just Googling stuff like STEM tutoring in Connecticut and how to help women in tech in Connecticut.

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And I found a local community leader who ran a local nonprofit

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and was a retired school principal in the area that wanted to get more people like me in.

112
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So I contacted her through her website that she had up already, and we met up and we started planning.

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
People talked about local libraries before. That is where we hosted the club that Jessica and I worked at together.

114
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's great because libraries have computers and they already have all the resources that you need.

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And the woman that I was working with had not only some other people that she wanted to bring in,

116
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
as well as a lot of connections within the community to other school teachers and recruiting students.

117
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah, and for me to join, it was really, really simple.

118
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I had worked with Girls Who Code over the summer and I wanted to continue with the fall.

119
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So I looked up online. You could do this with Girls Who Code or other organizations.

120
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This is just what I have experience with.

121
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And I found Neha's group that was within walking distance of my apartment.

122
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I was like, oh, this is perfect. So it's really pretty easy.

123
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Girls Who Code, I know, specifically has ones all over the country and they're expanding internationally,

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I think, to Canada and maybe some other places.

125
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Some other opportunities if you can't commit to a full year club is just doing a one day workshop at a company.

126
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's a great experience for girls or for any students.

127
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And then since I'm a teacher, one way to recruit is just to talk to guidance counselors, other teachers,

128
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
students, have them bring a friend to the club to try to recruit more people and just kind of get the word out there.

129
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So one major part of our group was to have presentations.

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So we had the girls twice a year show their work off to their family, their friends, and different people like that.

131
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This was a great opportunity because girls and I think all students are not great at public speaking,

132
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
but fortunately you'll never public speak to more friendly people than your family and friends.

133
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So it's a great place for them to try out new things.

134
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
They're able to show off their work and then also show it off to people who might want to join in the future.

135
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So we got a lot of new people join just through these things.

136
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We also encourage the older girls to kind of help with the younger girls to show them how it works.

137
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And then some of our older girls were commuting from a little bit farther to come to our club.

138
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So they actually created their own club more locally available to them after they saw, after they tried it out with us.

139
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So our kind of one part next was trying to prepare these girls for a part after the club.

140
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So this is building a group community, building confidence and curiosity beyond the scope of this club.

141
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So one key feature is these women tech spotlights.

142
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So I think a lot of people, especially young girls, might think that computer scientists might be older, male, and white.

143
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And we want to really show them that that's not necessarily true.

144
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So there's the idea that you can't be what you can't see.

145
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So if they don't have role models that they can identify with, it's going to be hard to get them to continue with this career.

146
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So pretty much every lesson or whenever we had time, we would try to do these women tech spotlights.

147
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So some people we talked about were like Ada Lovelace, a famous computer scientist from the 1800s, who was one of the first computer scientists.

148
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We also wanted to make sure that we provided a diverse role model.

149
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So this is Ayanna Howard, who is a robotics engineer who helped work with NASA.

150
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So we talked about her.

151
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We kind of ran these in different ways.

152
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Sometimes the girls would prepare it and then we'd have a group discussion.

153
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Sometimes we'd like put a name or show a video, have the girls do a little bit of research on their own, and then bring it back to a group discussion.

154
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I think having these role models was really important because you could see different girls really connect with different people that we were talking about.

155
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, the benefit to those is largely that you have the chance to bring in girls that get excited about technology,

156
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:42,000
even if they aren't during the course of like six weeks to 12 weeks able to necessarily become Python experts.

157
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And they're still just getting comfortable with variables.

158
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
At least they're excited about technology and excited about what's to come.

159
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So another big way that we did that was incorporating emerging areas of technology by which I definitely don't mean like blockchain and Kubernetes.

160
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I mean like stuff that kids already know what it is.

161
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So they know that they need clean water.

162
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And if we're able to find a YouTube video about, you know, a woman that works at UNICEF that is helping create technology for clean water,

163
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:21,000
then that's something that they get excited about and they're able to immediately see the ways that they can potentially have a career that impacts society and impacts other people using technology.

164
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So we would talk about stuff like health technology, design of like heating fabrics is what that one is,

165
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and a lot of different exciting areas for them to be able to potentially think of career opportunities with and think about like new innovations with.

166
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You can also encourage the girls to bring in their own ideas.

167
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And so whatever they're interested in.

168
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
In one of my classes, we had like a whole discussion about like self-driving cars and how we thought that might be good for the society or how it might be bad.

169
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So just getting their interest in it.

170
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So one of the key features of this is building a sisterhood or building a community of girls.

171
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So beyond the club, they'll feel like they have people that have their back.

172
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So we tried to build connections in some really simple ways.

173
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So one key way is just to make sure the girls are sitting next to each other and not in desks by their way.

174
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You really want to encourage this collaboration and have the girls help each other whenever it's possible.

175
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So if two girls are working on a similar assignment, maybe they can be like, oh, I have a question.

176
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, you just answered that question. Like you just had the same bug. Now you figured it out. Can you help me?

177
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Also encourage girls of older ages help with younger girls.

178
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So like for one of our projects, we had the older girls build a website that then hosted all the other girls projects, which is really cool way for them to all see that they're working towards a goal together.

179
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We also had them end the year by working on group projects.

180
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So for example, we had three, I think they're all in middle school work on a project about endangered species and they each research like a panda and different things.

181
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And they had so much fun looking at pictures and all this stuff.

182
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And then they each created their own project and coasters and came together to show like that endangered species are important.

183
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And they really bonded by just like brainstorming that project as a group.

184
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah, so I definitely recommend like trying to reach out to local communities and finding ways that you can potentially get started with a club like this.

185
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Like I was at the time that I found a local community leader to start this with.

186
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I was looking for committing like two to five hours a week.

187
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But we also had volunteers coming in that were committing like just one or two.

188
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And maybe just twice a month.

189
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So there's a wide range of ways you can get committed to these types of like long run after school programs or summer programs.

190
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But the biggest thing that I would say is that like experience probably not as needed as long as you're willing to be there and be encouraging and make sure that things are fun for people to.

191
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah, we are a little bit more of a group.

192
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah, we are also really fortunate in our group that we had people that had there were like four or five of us who each had different skills.

193
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So like I came in for more of an educator background.

194
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
They had some other people came from more of a computer science background.

195
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So together we were really able to put something that the girls really enjoyed and we felt like we could work together.

196
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Well, there's any questions.

197
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Now, I know that Girls of Code is more geared towards younger girls.

198
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Not not not.

199
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's that's all the generalization.

200
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The target audience tends to be younger girls because even at my own institution, the Girls of Code really focuses on local girls.

201
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And I think that's a really good point.

202
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I think that's a really good point.

203
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I think that's a really good point.

204
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So that's all the generalization.

205
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The target audience tends to be younger girls because even at my own institution, the Girls of Code really focuses on local elementary school or middle school and elementary school.

206
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I think there's some high scores.

207
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But how do you bridge that gap past scratch to more intermediate level stuff?

208
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah, so they're like.

209
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I teach it for them over the summer and the first week is scratch and the second week is Python.

210
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And that is the hardest week of the seven week program.

211
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It is so painful.

212
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I would say what you just have to do is go really, really slow.

213
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So like the curriculum had us doing like a hangman thing on the third day and it's a disaster.

214
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So then on the fourth day, we went back and did like a guessing game and that worked so well.

215
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And you're like, oh, wait, you can't like put ten lines of code.

216
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
There's no way you could have done this hangman.

217
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So I think that's when you just like have to really like slow down and be patient.

218
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And that's when like we always had helpers and you just have them like really ready.

219
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Like you got to be ready to go and help with that.

220
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So it is really a challenging thing.

221
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I think the student teacher ratio is really important for that as well.

222
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Being able to have multitude of volunteers, even if they're just dropping in for one time, works really well.

223
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And if you're at a place where you can like broadcast to all of your friends,

224
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
all of the software engineers and data scientists that you know, that works really well.

225
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I would just say that like the biggest thing we would look at would be whether or not students wanted to return the next year,

226
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,000
as well as like the general vibe that they had, because this is all up to them, whether or not they come.

227
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's not something that they have to come to.

228
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's not a school program. It's after school. They could just quit if they wanted.

229
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So we definitely consider the fact that they kept coming back and their parents kept dropping them off

230
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
as meaning that like they wanted to and their parents thought it was valuable for them.

231
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah, we didn't necessarily do surveys or anything like that, but I'm sure you could find some on the Girls Who Code's website.

232
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah.

233
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh, there's a question over there.

234
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, so I would say like I think some of the girls when they first go in, they're like concerned to say like, oh, I'm interested in this.

235
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But then they find another girl that's like also interested in this and they like bond over video games,

236
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
which is something like they might not necessarily feel like share because it's not necessarily a female thing to really enjoy.

237
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So I think just like it gives them more of a space where they can be brave and take risks that they might not take in other environments.

238
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Thank you. Thank you.
