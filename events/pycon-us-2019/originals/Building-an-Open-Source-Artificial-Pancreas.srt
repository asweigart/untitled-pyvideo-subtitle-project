1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Hi, how's it going?

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,920
Nice.

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,920
Okay.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,040
So I'm here to talk about an open source artificial pancreas.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,760
And it looks like this.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
Here's mine.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,760
All right.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,760
Thank you very much.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,760
I'm kidding.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,760
I'm kidding.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,520
I'm kidding.

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,520
I'm kidding.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,800
So if you're like most of the people that hear about this or, you know, new friends

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,320
that find out I have one of these, you probably have like all of a sudden 50 new questions

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,320
you want to ask.

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,200
So I'm hoping to kind of start to cover a lot of those in my little spot here.

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,640
But first, a little introduction.

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
My name is Sarah Withee.

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm a software engineer.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I like calling myself a polyglot software engineer.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,360
So I don't really stick with one particular language.

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,520
So I work in Python and a whole bunch of other languages I won't bring up here.

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,440
I'm also a robot and hardware tinkerer.

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,640
So I like playing with different IoT things and things like that.

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,280
I also do a lot of public speaking, teaching workshops and things like that.

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,760
I'm also a type one diabetic, which I haven't used to share.

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,400
I didn't used to share that much.

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,960
I've started doing it since I think this technology is really cool.

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,560
But in the process of sharing a lot of the stuff, I've been able to start to meet other

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,360
people that are type one diabetics or family members, friends of other diabetics.

31
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,360
And so they've been interested in this technology as well.

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,120
So I've been really happy to kind of share that part of my life.

33
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,440
But to really explain kind of what this device does and how it works, I kind of need to backtrack

34
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,200
a little bit to the science of kind of what goes on.

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,120
So the quick rundown of carbohydrates, which I'm sure you've heard of, is that when you

36
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,160
need a bunch of carbohydrates and sugar really is kind of a form of carbohydrate, your body

37
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,280
breaks those down into glucose and fructose.

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,160
For this talk, we don't care about fructose.

39
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,540
The glucose then goes into your bloodstream.

40
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,040
Your pancreas sees that rise in glucose and says like, oh, no, I need to do something.

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,340
So it makes a hormone called insulin, which you probably also heard of.

42
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,320
Your body cells see that insulin and then start to use that along with the glucose and

43
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,160
use that to make energy or use it for energy.

44
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,120
So you can kind of see the carbohydrates are really sort of important nutrients that your

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,720
body needs.

46
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,880
And diabetes is kind of where this whole process doesn't work right anymore.

47
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,960
You probably heard of the different types, but just to kind of go over them.

48
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,280
Type one is an autoimmune disease.

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,520
So something in your body has attacked the cells that are making the insulin so you don't

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,680
end up making it anymore.

51
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,040
Type two is where your body becomes resistant to that insulin.

52
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,520
So you're still making it, but your cells for some reason aren't using it all up correctly.

53
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,820
And then there's gestational, which is where once you become pregnant, your body then becomes

54
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,560
resistant to it, which is sometimes just temporarily while you're pregnant and sometimes kind of

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
permanently.

56
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,520
There's a few other rare types too.

57
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,640
I landed in the hospital once where I had a swollen thing in my stomach and they needed

58
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,840
to do surgery and they did a blood test.

59
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,360
And coincidentally, I was diabetic.

60
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,880
They're just like, surprise, you need surgery and now you have this lovely chronic disease.

61
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,680
But they found out later I don't have the autoimmune disease, but I'm still type one,

62
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,120
which is sort of a weird thing, but not really important for the purpose of this talk.

63
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
So more rundown.

64
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,200
In the United States, we measure this, the glucose in your blood using milligrams per

65
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
deciliter.

66
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,480
And a deciliter is like one tenth of a liter.

67
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,600
So it's sort of an odd amount, but it works.

68
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,800
Other countries use millimoles per liter.

69
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,480
And there's like a conversion rate for that.

70
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,240
But for the purpose of this talk, we're not going to go into that.

71
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,080
Before meals, normal people are, as I like to call them, civilians.

72
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,120
Usually are about 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter.

73
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,400
And once you eat, obviously, you know, the more glucose enters your body.

74
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,240
So it kind of goes up for a little bit and then goes back down.

75
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,080
So somewhere in like the 70 to 140 range.

76
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,480
For diabetics, you usually have to manually do this process yourself.

77
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,960
The doctors like to give you a wider range.

78
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,280
So usually 80 to 150 and then 80 to 180 for those two ranges.

79
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,880
That's just because we'll find out in a little bit you don't want to go too high and you

80
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,120
don't want to go too low with that.

81
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,680
So the problem is the diabetes is really hard to manage.

82
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,760
For one thing, normal people usually aren't told about the warning signs until it's too late.

83
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,080
So I know when they found it in me, they're just like, well, these are the warning signs.

84
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Didn't you see those?

85
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,680
And I'm like, well, yeah, I saw them, but I thought I had excuses for all of them.

86
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,480
Like other things were going on that led to these.

87
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,560
The other case was that usually diabetics are told either too little information or

88
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,560
too much information.

89
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,840
So sort of this overlord.

90
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,160
And sometimes they're usually really terrible at math.

91
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,320
So you'll start to find out there's a lot of things that we have to kind of take account

92
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,040
when we deal with all this.

93
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,320
So another reason it's hard is we have to start counting how many carbs we eat and how

94
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,520
much medicine we have to take for it.

95
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,920
It's not just a simple you always take this amount three times a day.

96
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,960
We really have to do it based on what we eat.

97
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,960
So a unit of insulin is one one hundredth of a milliliter.

98
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,720
So just throughout the course of this talk, we'll just talk about units.

99
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,080
And this carb ratio is so however many number of carbs you eat, you know, that amount of

100
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,000
insulin is what you need to sort of counteract that in your body.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,320
These ratios can be anywhere from usually like three grams to 50 grams.

102
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,440
So this ratio is really, really wide.

103
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,440
And we'll also find out that this ratio varies from person to person.

104
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,840
So if you look at the people around you, their carb ratios are different than yours.

105
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,040
It can vary at different times of day.

106
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,960
So I know I need a little bit more insulin at the beginning of the day.

107
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,600
And in the evening, I usually need a lot less or a little bit less, at least.

108
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,400
And then under different conditions.

109
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,880
So when you're sleeping, you might need a little less or a little more.

110
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,400
And it depends when you're stressed.

111
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,960
We'll find out in a little bit that ends up making things go up.

112
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,240
Different things like that can alter this ratio.

113
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,200
And then it changes over your lifespan.

114
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,760
So your ratio last year is not the same as this year, which is not the same as next year.

115
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,480
Kind of a pain.

116
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,440
To add more interesting complications to it, when you start to eat your carbs,

117
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,600
within 10 to 20 minutes is when those start getting into your bloodstream.

118
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,160
But the insulin that you would take to counteract that starts kind of slowly at

119
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,480
first and then hits really hard about 45 to 60 minutes in.

120
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,280
And then just over the course of five hours finishes absorbing.

121
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,760
There's this really weird curve.

122
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,000
But this, where the blue line is the absorption rate for insulin.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,680
So it kind of picks up in about the course of an hour and then tapers off over five.

124
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,920
And the purple area is your reduction rate of that glucose in your bloodstream.

125
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,040
So it kind of starts going down slowly, dives down really fast.

126
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,760
Let's make it more complicated.

127
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,240
So if your glucose gets too high in your bloodstream, bad things start to happen.

128
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,640
So it ends up clogging your capillaries, the really,

129
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,920
really fine blood vessels in your body.

130
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,000
Which is why people end up with circulation problems in your feet.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,480
They lose their eyesight, sometimes their kidneys go bad.

132
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,840
These are all places where that glucose can build up and stop your prevention.

133
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,440
And then organs slowly die.

134
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,720
I hate to kind of say that, it's kind of bad, but yeah.

135
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,520
When your glucose goes too low, you end up with sort of a different type of problem.

136
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,000
Where immediately you start shaking, you start sweating, you get really weak.

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,920
And I get sort of like foggy brained where I'm like,

138
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,080
no I'm there but sort of weird things kind of happen.

139
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,040
I pretty much have to set and I'm like out for at least 20 minutes.

140
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,400
Worst case scenarios, you can land in comas in the hospital.

141
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
It's really not great.

142
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,600
You don't want that to happen.

143
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,560
So we have to maintain this like perfect level on top of like all these ratios and

144
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,480
things we have to figure out.

145
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,120
Let's make it more complicated.

146
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,040
When we're stressed, our body makes our glucose levels rise up.

147
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,800
And same for when we're sick.

148
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
It kind of goes up as well.

149
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,000
When we exercise, it goes down because your cells need more energy.

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,080
So it begins to use up what's in the bloodstream.

151
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,720
If you have a little bit to drink,

152
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,160
most alcoholic drinks usually have some carbs in them, so your sugars are going to go up.

153
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,920
But if you drink too much, then your blood composition's a little different, so

154
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,160
your glucose ends up going down.

155
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,720
And then if you happen to have that special time of the month,

156
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,560
your glucose can also go up.

157
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,880
So, you know, a lot more fun adventures in diabetic land.

158
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,680
But I'm not done.

159
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,120
Correction ratios are what happens when you go high and

160
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,000
you need to take some medicine to make that go lower.

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,120
So however many milligrams per deciliter high you are,

162
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,640
there's a ratio of you can bring that down with so many units of insulin as well.

163
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,160
Similarly, this also varies from person to person.

164
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,840
It can vary over time, all those different things too.

165
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,720
So hopefully you're completely overwhelmed at how insanely complicated all of this is

166
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,680
to do on your own, but hopefully as technologists in the room,

167
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,560
you've been kind of thinking like, wait a minute, can we use technology to fix this?

168
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,720
You're right, we can use technology to fix this.

169
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,240
So there's two main things that have been around for

170
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,880
a really long time that diabetics use.

171
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,840
One is called a continuous glucose monitor, and one is an insulin pump.

172
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,760
And you may have seen these.

173
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,560
The first one's called a continuous glucose monitor, or CGM.

174
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,200
I have one on my arm right here, this little pod thing, whatever you want to call it.

175
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,640
So every five to 15 minutes, they can grab a measure of the glucose in my blood.

176
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,680
And then over Bluetooth, send it to my phone.

177
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,720
Which right now it's not actually sending to my phone, but.

178
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,200
So I can get a live value at any moment of what the blood sugar in my body is.

179
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,400
And so you can kind of see in the picture,

180
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,480
there's this tiny little needle that just goes under the skin.

181
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,400
And it's kind of like hair, like it's really flexible.

182
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,640
It's not even really like a needle, it just kind of sits in there.

183
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,160
So as I kind of move my arm, that whole thing can move with it, so

184
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,880
it's not even really uncomfortable.

185
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,040
I don't even feel it going in.

186
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,120
The other part that you've probably seen people have is called an insulin pump.

187
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,280
So it attaches with a tube to your body.

188
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,880
There's no good place in the dress to keep this.

189
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,480
Oh my god.

190
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,000
This is mine right here.

191
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,480
So mine's attached to my stomach at the moment.

192
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,800
But basically throughout the course of the day, it delivers insulin to my body.

193
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,720
And I can go in and punch in there, like give me two and

194
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,440
a half units right now, so it would do that.

195
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,400
So it's kind of nice that I can go in and say it whatever I want it to do.

196
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,960
And there's also, your liver makes glucose all day, so

197
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,320
it has a built in value to kind of give me a little bit throughout the course of

198
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,600
the day too.

199
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,760
So that's kind of nice, but it's a really static process.

200
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,320
This doesn't do anything on its own, it's really kind of stupid.

201
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,040
So, and the other problem is they don't talk to each other.

202
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,600
These two things kind of live independently, but

203
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,520
they don't interact in any way whatsoever.

204
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,200
Which is kind of where this do it yourself artificial bank race comes in.

205
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,760
Moving forward to the 21st century.

206
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,480
All right, so that's where this little do that comes in.

207
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,000
So there's two main types that are kind of out there at the moment.

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,600
One's called OpenAPS, which is the Open Artificial Pancreas System.

209
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,560
And it's a Linux based IoT device, so

210
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,640
I have a little thing on here that's running Debian at the moment.

211
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,600
It's attached to a 900 megahertz transceiver, so

212
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,920
it can send out signals and listen to the airwaves.

213
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,680
And all the code, including the board it's on, is all open source.

214
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,840
We can go to GitHub and get all of that stuff, so it's kind of cool.

215
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,200
The other main one is called LoopKit.

216
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,160
So it's the open looping framework.

217
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,000
We're looping is sort of this process of using the values on the blood sugar meter

218
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,920
and changing the insulin pump values from it.

219
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,760
So it's also similarly, there's another Bluetooth transceiver board.

220
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,920
It runs on its own, so it doesn't do the calculations like this one does.

221
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,400
Your phone does that.

222
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,000
So your phone tells it to tell your insulin pump what to do.

223
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,960
And all that's open source as well, but it's really geared just towards iOS devices,

224
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,000
whereas OpenAPS can be used for either one.

225
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,440
So this is where the looping process comes in.

226
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,640
So your CGM gets the value of the bloodstream, sends it over Bluetooth to

227
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,040
a receiving device, which I use my phone.

228
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,360
And I use this open source app called Xtrip, which I really like.

229
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,600
This app then sends it up to a database, basically, and

230
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
one's called Night Scout that I'm using.

231
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,600
And Night Scout will collect all these values, but also kind of collect the trans

232
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,080
and device statuses, since I don't know the battery value of my thing,

233
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,040
it collects that as well.

234
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,400
And these you can deploy to a free instance of Heroku or Azure,

235
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,080
which is kind of nice.

236
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,360
From there, one of your devices, either the LoopKit or the OpenAPS,

237
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,800
will download those values, look at kind of the trends that are happening over

238
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,440
15 minutes, 4 hours, and 24 hours, I think.

239
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,080
Kind of figure out what's going on with your body at the moment,

240
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,240
kind of what your sensitivity is, and then take that and

241
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,080
send some information to your insulin pump to say,

242
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,920
either give you a little more or give you a little less medicine.

243
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,920
So it's pretty cool.

244
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,480
Time for a live demo.

245
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,560
So really quickly, I'm gonna back out of this.

246
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,360
I'm gonna mirror my display.

247
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,360
Cool.

248
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,240
All right, so live demo pending the internet working.

249
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,320
Cool.

250
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,280
Besides the big red mark there.

251
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:24,000
For whatever reason, it hasn't gotten a value from my CDM for 34 minutes, but

252
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,080
that's fine.

253
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,320
Last it read, it was 102.

254
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,920
Does anybody remember if that was good or bad?

255
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,440
Pretty good?

256
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,040
Yeah, it's fine.

257
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,960
So these little plot points here are individual data points.

258
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,600
I don't know if you can see my mouse cursor at all.

259
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,600
But the green dots are individual data points.

260
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,120
The blue dots are kind of its trends.

261
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,800
So given one particular algorithm, it thinks it could possibly go up a bit.

262
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,640
One algorithm, it says it can go down a little bit.

263
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,240
And it's not doing very good predictions at the moment,

264
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,320
because it hasn't gotten a value for a few minutes.

265
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,160
I'm guessing to signal interference in here.

266
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,680
I can also turn on the basals.

267
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,440
And the basals is like that all day value.

268
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,520
We can kind of see up here in this blue bar.

269
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,680
So there's a dotted line, it's gonna be really hard to see on the screen.

270
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,480
That's the default value that's programmed in the pump.

271
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,760
And those blue lines are it adjusting my insulin throughout the course of the day.

272
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,520
So there's a couple times where it's just like,

273
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,520
I'm gonna give you a lot more to try and keep that level.

274
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,600
But other times where it's just like, hey, you're doing fine,

275
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,160
let's dive that down a bit.

276
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,280
So you can kind of see over the course of 12 hours,

277
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,160
it's made a pretty good amount of adjustments.

278
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,760
And the great thing is this works overnight as well.

279
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,800
So I don't even have to be awake to let this kind of manage things on its own.

280
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,000
Which is really good because a lot of diabetics struggle with what happens if

281
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,280
it goes low in the middle of the night and they don't wake up.

282
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,080
Really bad things can happen.

283
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,200
So systems like this can help prevent health issues like that.

284
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,880
If I can plug it in real quick.

285
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,080
We can show you kind of live on the device itself.

286
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,040
All right, so.

287
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,720
Cool, I'm still logged in.

288
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,800
Saurborg is the name of my device, Sarah Cyborg, Saurborg.

289
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,840
I was hoping some people would be amused with that.

290
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,560
If I can run this log command so

291
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,400
it can see live at any given moment what it's doing.

292
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,200
So it looks like kind of at the bottom here it just started our loop process.

293
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,720
Since you can only get a new value every five minutes,

294
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,400
it doesn't constantly calculate.

295
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,000
So it really only makes sense to like every five minutes do some of this data

296
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,520
analysis.

297
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,160
So it waits a little bit.

298
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,160
But you can kind of see there's a whole bunch of log data up there.

299
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,440
So what it does is it listens for some radio interference.

300
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,800
If it gets the all clear and then starts talking to the pump,

301
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,680
finds out the latest dosages maybe the pump has given out.

302
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,800
Sync that with its own data up in that Heroku instance, the database app.

303
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,760
And then kind of see what my trends are and then send a new value.

304
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,560
This is, hey, insulin pump, for the next 30 minutes, give this much insulin instead.

305
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,000
So it's constantly giving like all these little minor variations,

306
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,280
which in turn ends up in that little kind of graph.

307
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,600
Well, let's get that.

308
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,360
Maybe we can go back to, oops, I don't want to start.

309
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:35,880
I'm sorry.

310
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,680
Of course, I'm on the wrong monitor.

311
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,280
Slideshow somewhere, right?

312
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,360
So hopefully that was kind of cool.

313
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,400
Let's go to the FAQ section, which like I said,

314
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,520
a lot of people usually ask me a lot of interesting questions about this.

315
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,400
So usually I first get, wait a minute,

316
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,760
is that really a pancreas if it's not like actually inside of you?

317
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,680
And I guess no, it's not actually like a legit pancreas.

318
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,840
But it really much replicates all the things that your pancreas does anyway.

319
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,440
So kind of artificial pancreas is like the simplistic way to call it.

320
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,680
The more technical term would be like an open hybrid looping system,

321
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,360
which nobody knows what that means anyway.

322
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,320
So okay, so if this thing is on the internet and it's giving you medicine,

323
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
like is it really safe?

324
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,280
And the answer is yes, it's actually pretty darn safe.

325
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,280
The woman that discovered the initial algorithm to kind of do this pretty

326
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,160
accurately, she is a researcher and was doing this against her own blood sugars.

327
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,480
Ended up getting like some values from other people,

328
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,400
testing your algorithm against those, seeing if it was responding correctly.

329
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,680
And then her husband was a software engineer,

330
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,600
wrote some of those into some scripts.

331
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,680
And then some other people found how to wirelessly communicate to the pump.

332
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,280
And sort of all these like little small scripts came together into sort of this

333
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,440
bigger package.

334
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,280
Everything is published online, including both her research in research format,

335
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,800
as well as kind of, you can see everything on GitHub.

336
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,160
You can understand sort of the process of the algorithms.

337
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,880
And also there's hard limits.

338
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,280
So I sat in there, you cannot give me more than so much insulin at any given hour.

339
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,320
So it will never go above that.

340
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,760
And if it tries to, it sort of shuts off the whole system.

341
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,520
Okay, and again, kind of if it's online, can't you hack it?

342
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,080
I'm like sure, anything online can be hackable.

343
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,080
But let me tell you how you would actually have to hack this.

344
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,960
So first you would have to find the IP address of my phone.

345
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,440
And second of all, you'd have to find the IP address of the device that's tethered

346
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:53,960
to my phone.

347
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,280
And then once you find that, you actually have to log on to the device through Linux.

348
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,360
And then once you do that, you then have to find the script that actually issues

349
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,480
the commands to my pump.

350
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,760
Wait several minutes for that communication process to happen.

351
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,000
And then once it starts dosing, it's really slow.

352
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,680
Remember how I said it takes a time because otherwise you'd just get this big

353
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,120
buildup of insulin in you.

354
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,440
So then it's really slow.

355
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,800
And then because it takes so long to absorb,

356
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,840
I would probably detect something weird is going on with my body before anything bad

357
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,560
happens.

358
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,320
And I would just eat a bunch of candy or something to make it go back up.

359
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,040
So it's great.

360
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,160
Whenever I go low, I'm just like yes, I'm eating cookies for my health.

361
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,320
As I like to call the day after holidays with a bunch of candy,

362
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,960
hypoglycemic discount day.

363
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,560
So yeah, you can hack it.

364
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,680
But I think the process is in no way worth the effort to actually do this.

365
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,200
You would have to really, really, really not like me.

366
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,880
And then at its worst, it's really just a bad inconvenience.

367
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,160
Is it kind of annoying to carry all this stuff around?

368
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,680
Sure.

369
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,920
I mean, I have to either carry it on my backpack or attach it to a purse or a

370
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,520
belt loop or something like that.

371
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,000
So it's a little bit annoying because I've been gone for a few days at a

372
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,520
conference.

373
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,320
These are all my spare insulin pump supplies, extra insulin,

374
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,160
CGM things, a whole bunch of nonsense.

375
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,440
So that's a little bit annoying.

376
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,480
But my health is so much better because of this.

377
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,200
It's managing a lot of things I don't have to do anymore, which is really great.

378
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,160
What if the battery dies?

379
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,120
Good question.

380
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,840
So yes, I have to charge my pancreas.

381
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,960
It happens.

382
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,080
So if it dies, then the pump just doesn't hear anything anymore.

383
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,920
That temporary value quits.

384
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,640
And then it goes back to its default.

385
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,240
So it goes from basically dynamic back to static.

386
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,120
It doesn't kill me or anything like that.

387
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,640
Same for if it loses internet access.

388
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,440
Since it can't get those values and can't really detect the trends, it just kind of

389
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,480
goes back to that default status, which is sort of what's happening now because I

390
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,120
can't read the things on my blood sugar meter.

391
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,840
Why is this not FDA approved?

392
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,080
Complicated question, but the simple answer is it's not a sold product.

393
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,240
So you don't go to the store and buy this.

394
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,040
It's kind of this hack together internet of things device that I'm using to sort

395
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,640
of mess with my body.

396
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,440
So since it's sort of like a home built device that only works on me,

397
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,120
it doesn't really have to go through the FDA.

398
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,920
And why have not any of these medical technology companies really jumped on

399
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,160
this yet?

400
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,120
And the simple answer is they usually claim it's too expensive, too risky,

401
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,360
too whatever.

402
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,840
They're tech that they're already using works.

403
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,840
People are paying gobs and gobs of money for it, so why change anything?

404
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,640
But as they're starting to notice this open source community building these

405
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,960
things and it's working really, really well and it's getting a lot more

406
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,160
publicity now, they've started to think like, okay, so I guess we need to release

407
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,960
some technology like this.

408
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,200
And one company has released sort of a looping system.

409
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,280
It's not really great.

410
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,920
People keep complaining about how kind of terrible it is.

411
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,680
But an organization called Tytool, which does some data analytics on blood sugar

412
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,760
values, has jumped in to say, you know what, we'll be that intermediary.

413
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,040
We'll let you keep your proprietary technology, but

414
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,440
we want to help enable open source software like this, be able to talk to your pump.

415
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,720
So I think only within like the last week or two have they actually released a beta

416
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,600
version for the first company that they've been talking to.

417
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,360
So it's really been kind of fascinating to watch this process just blossom only in

418
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,280
the last couple months.

419
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,200
Kind of to start to end it up, the top one is kind of an example of perhaps

420
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,760
a typical day without the pancreas going.

421
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,440
So you can kind of see I have a lot of high values there.

422
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,800
On good days, maybe it roller coasters a bit between good and bad.

423
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,960
On bad days, it just kind of stays high and, you know, it's a lot harder to manage.

424
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,760
The bottom one is a lot busier.

425
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,520
There's a lot of stuff going on on there.

426
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,000
But you can kind of see that value is pretty much in that perfect range,

427
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,160
pretty much all day long.

428
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,360
There's a couple of tiny little high points.

429
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,600
But that blue value at the bottom, it's super active.

430
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,800
All day long, it's adjusting me to keep it as much in that green value as possible.

431
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,360
Okay, so where is all this code?

432
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,600
You don't have to pay attention to this.

433
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,320
I'll post my slides on Twitter and all those things.

434
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,720
Instructions are on read the docs for

435
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,360
the open APS system, which is usually Android.

436
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,640
You can do it on iOS too.

437
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,640
My friend Tracy does it.

438
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,440
Open APS, Night Scout, and Xtrip are all on GitHub.

439
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,600
If you're doing the iOS based system, all the instructions are there too.

440
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,440
There's LoopKit and RileyKit.

441
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,640
RileyKit's the hardware board that does the communication.

442
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,800
So they've open sourced that as well, which is really cool.

443
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,880
And I kind of want to wrap it up with thinking about open source software.

444
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,840
There's not a lot of products that we think about that actually can

445
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,960
legitimately change lives.

446
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,920
I think when I think open source software, I either think one quirky

447
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,320
library that somebody built at one point that does one special thing.

448
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,320
Or something like Firefox, which is this huge,

449
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,160
monstrous open source project that has tons of funding and stuff like that.

450
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:29,200
But about 30 people or so have come together to build this product.

451
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,040
It's working great.

452
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,680
They've tinkered with it over three or four years.

453
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,200
It's pretty much at the point where anybody can download it and

454
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,960
just run with it.

455
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,480
And good examples of who it's affecting.

456
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,920
Young children that are diagnosed with type 1 don't have to manage their

457
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,320
own blood sugars anymore.

458
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,400
This thing can help work with that.

459
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,920
Because kids just want to go out and play.

460
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,600
They don't want to sit in the nurse's office and have to get insulin shots.

461
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,720
Their parents can also get notifications of what's going on with their body too.

462
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,560
Older people that can't manage the medicine as well.

463
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,760
Low income people can run this because it's free.

464
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,960
Those without health insurance don't need as much fancy complicated technology

465
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,280
outside the pumps and CGMs.

466
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,600
I guess I'll end it with who do you know that can SSH into their pancreas?

467
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Me, you know one now.

468
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,280
Hi, I'm Sarah.

469
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,160
You can SSH into my pancreas.

470
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,560
Anyway.

471
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,760
Thank you all for coming.

472
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,640
I really like sharing this technology.

473
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,520
I really like sharing how it's worked well for me.

474
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,840
You can find me on all the social media things as geekygirlsara.

475
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,480
You can also email if you have questions or

476
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,120
you want to learn about deploying this for maybe a family member or

477
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,320
friend or perhaps yourself.

478
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,960
It's helloedsarawithyou.com.

479
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,360
Slides for everything are up on geekygirlsara.com.

480
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,200
Thank you for coming and definitely find me in the hallways.

481
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
You can come see it.

482
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,800
You can hold it.

483
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,280
Maybe I can pull out my laptop and

484
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,720
you can see kind of how the Linuxy side of it works.

485
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,760
So thank you all for coming.
