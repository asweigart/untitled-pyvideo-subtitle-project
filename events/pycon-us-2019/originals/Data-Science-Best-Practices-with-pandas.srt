1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Good.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome, everyone.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,600
We're going to go ahead and get started.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,960
So thank you so much for being here.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,960
My name is Kevin Markham.

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,880
I'll be your instructor for this tutorial.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,920
This is Data Science Best Practices with Pandas.

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,920
Very happy to be here.

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,800
It's my privilege to be teaching you today.

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,840
So before I talk about the tutorial, I'm just going to tell you some setup instructions

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,800
if you haven't done them yet so that you can get caught up with that.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,440
And then I'll introduce myself and what we're doing.

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,120
And then we'll get started.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,440
So you'll want to go to the GitHub repository.

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,440
And I snagged that sweet bit.ly link slash PyCon 2019 if you want to go directly there.

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:54,280
And there's some instructions here on downloading a CSV file, checking that Pandas and Matplotlib

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,000
are working.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And that's about it.

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,280
I'll link here to the TED Talks dataset.

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,000
You're welcome to pull that up.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,880
We'll use it just a tiny bit.

23
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,680
But yeah, go ahead and open your Python environment, whatever environment you're most comfortable

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,120
with.

25
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:19,080
And put that CSV file into the same directory or wherever you usually open files from.

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,560
And that's that.

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,560
If people run into problems, I've got two backups, backup solutions.

28
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,720
One backup is I have some flash drives with the data file on them and some flash drives

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,800
with Anaconda installers if your machine just isn't working and you want to install Anaconda

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,000
right now.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,880
The other backup is that if at any time you are having problems with your machine, just

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,480
go to the top of the repo, click Launch Binder, and you'll be running Jupyter Notebook in

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,560
the cloud with the data file and with the libraries you already need installed.

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,720
It takes a couple minutes to open, but it's a great solution if you're having big problems

35
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,560
with your machine.

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Okay.

37
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,960
All right.

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,480
So while anyone's getting set up that's not already, I'll just tell you about myself.

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,760
I live in Asheville, North Carolina with my wife and my son.

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,040
And I used to live in Washington, D.C.

41
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,400
I'm the founder of Data School.

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,360
I teach data science in Python.

43
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,400
I teach in person at General Assembly in D.C.

44
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,080
I have a lot of YouTube videos.

45
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,800
Anyone seen one of my YouTube videos on something?

46
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Cool.

47
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Awesome.

48
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Thanks.

49
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Cool.

50
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,000
Well, I have taught a couple tutorials.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,400
I taught a machine learning one at PyCon 2016 and one on Pandas at 2018.

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,080
That was a lot of fun.

53
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,480
And since I'm online only, it's a real pleasure for me to be in the classroom these days.

54
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,960
So this is great.

55
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:55,560
What we're going to be doing today is my goal is to help you become more fluent at using

56
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,880
Pandas to answer your own data science questions.

57
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,080
So I do expect you know some Pandas.

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,120
We're going to be doing a lot of exercises.

59
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,440
Basically, we're going to have this single data set.

60
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,500
I'm going to ask you a question or give you a task.

61
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,560
You're going to try to answer it using Pandas.

62
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,320
And then we'll discuss the answer together.

63
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,880
We'll spend a good amount of time on that where I'll kind of walk through a solution.

64
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,720
We can talk about it.

65
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,600
And at the end of each section, there are just some takeaways, some best practices that

66
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm trying to communicate.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,720
In terms of the pacing, this is intermediate level.

68
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,080
So if you feel beginner to Pandas, it might go a little fast.

69
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,120
If you feel like pretty advanced, it might go a little slow.

70
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,860
But I'm aiming for that middle ground.

71
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:51,220
If you do finish an exercise early, I've in most cases got a bonus written down that

72
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,220
I can give you.

73
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,580
So always let me know if you want a bonus exercise to work on, if you're just sitting

74
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,980
there and I'm happy to give you something.

75
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,860
Alternatively, just help your neighbor or just explore the data set on your own, make

76
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,940
up a question and start trying to answer it with Pandas.

77
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,940
And I can help you.

78
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,940
Yeah, please.

79
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:15,940
Yeah, I might.

80
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:22,940
Oh, please.

81
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:29,180
Okay.

82
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,680
So the question is about using a Conda environment for running the Jupyter Notebook.

83
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,900
So if you're in a Conda environment and you have installed the Notebook in that environment,

84
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:43,660
you'll have access to it.

85
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,660
That sounds good.

86
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,300
Yep.

87
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,340
Let's see what else.

88
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,420
If you are struggling to keep up at any point, don't worry so much about that.

89
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,940
Most of the exercises are independent of one another, so you won't get too far behind.

90
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,140
Don't worry about the red and green pieces of paper.

91
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,380
Final thoughts, if you're not used to using the Jupyter Notebook, that's what I'm going

92
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,180
to be using, but you should use what you're most comfortable with.

93
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,480
Questions are welcome at any time, but I've kind of timed this out and it's a lot of material,

94
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,180
so if questions are too far off topic, I'll probably just save it for a break or to talk

95
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,780
with you one-on-one and I'm happy to help.

96
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:28,540
We will break from 3 o'clock to 3.20 and we will end at 4.40.

97
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,040
All the code I'm typing will be posted on GitHub, so you don't feel like you have to

98
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,880
type everything if you're trying to keep up.

99
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
That's it.

100
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Any questions for now before I jump into the first exercise?

101
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,880
Awesome.

102
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,520
All right.

103
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,520
What I'm going to do, this is all live coding, and this first exercise we're just going to

104
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,640
do it together, so I would encourage you to just type along with me.

105
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:08,080
We're just going to do an introduction to the dataset.

106
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,360
This is really just kind of a warm-up.

107
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,640
Go ahead and follow along.

108
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,000
In terms of ... This is a dataset of TED Talks.

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,440
Has anyone ever seen a TED Talk?

110
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,120
Yes, everyone.

111
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,400
Can someone just define quickly what a TED Talk is?

112
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,920
A talk about technology, entertainment, or design, or that was the original idea.

113
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,480
They're short talks, very popular.

114
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,640
They've been around for a long time and they have kind of a message they're trying to communicate.

115
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:45,520
This dataset, actually before I start typing, there's this page on the Kaggle Datasets website,

116
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,440
which by the way is a great way to find and explore datasets.

117
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,800
This is a description of the TED Talks dataset.

118
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,920
If you don't have this open, it might be useful.

119
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,120
The thing that may be useful is there's some metadata here about the dataset that might

120
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,520
be useful for you to understand, so I would keep that page open.

121
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,040
This was scraped from the TED.com website.

122
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,160
That's where this came from.

123
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,600
I just wanted to set the context for the dataset, but let's go ahead and just import pandas.

124
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:28,160
Sorry, it's harder to type and talk than it seems.

125
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,640
I'm using, I think, .24, .2, but you can use any modern version.

126
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,160
Should be just fine for today.

127
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:45,360
We're just going to import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

128
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,320
If you're in the notebook as well, matplotlib inline.

129
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:58,440
If you're not in the notebook, that's largely or completely irrelevant.

130
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,520
Then we're just going to read in the dataset, and we're just going to read it into a dataframe

131
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,720
called TED.

132
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,880
It's in my local directory, so I'm just going to read right from TED.csv.

133
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,080
Let's just take a quick look at the dataset.

134
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,920
If you're falling behind, definitely feel free to ask your neighbor if you missed a

135
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,560
line of code.

136
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,160
Is it okay if I take the font size down one notch, because I want to get a little more

137
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
on screen?

138
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,640
Is this okay, or is that a little small in terms of reading the code up here?

139
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
Bigger?

140
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Pretty small?

141
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,920
Okay, I'll go back up.

142
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:45,120
Each row in this dataset represents a single TED talk.

143
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,160
We're just going to check the shape, just the shape attribute.

144
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,880
There are 2,550 talks, so those are rows and columns.

145
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,000
Then we'll just take a quick look at the D types.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,440
This is just what I do when I get a new dataset and want to be vaguely familiar with what's

147
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
in it.

148
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,760
We'll just take a quick look at the D types.

149
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,560
It's just a blend of integer columns and object columns.

150
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,400
Object columns are usually strings, but what else can an object column contain?

151
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,680
Just go ahead and raise your hand and I'll grab someone.

152
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,280
For categories, it'll actually say category, I believe.

153
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
There's something else.

154
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,920
What else can an object type contain?

155
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,720
Other than strings, other things?

156
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Yep.

157
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,400
Object data types, though they usually have strings, they can contain arbitrary Python

158
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,640
objects such as lists or dictionaries.

159
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,200
That is something useful to keep in mind, that they're not always strings.

160
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,320
But yeah, the most important thing, we have a bunch of int columns and object columns.

161
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:59,720
I'm just going to write this and not explain it and then show you the result.

162
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,520
Can anyone tell me what this code is checking for?

163
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,440
Right there?

164
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,160
What I did is .isna.sum.

165
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,280
I'm checking for missing values.

166
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,560
That's another useful thing to know when you open up a data set.

167
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,920
Isna, which is the same as isnull, isna outputs a data frame of Boolean values.

168
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:30,160
Then when you sum it, sum sums along the zero axis, the rows axis, which gives you column

169
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,240
sums.

170
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,960
True values are treated as ones.

171
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,120
False values are treated as zeros.

172
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,360
A lot happening in that line.

173
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,960
The bottom line is that speaker occupation has six missing values.

174
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,120
I'm not going to take any action at this time, but this is something you should know about

175
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,960
any data set you're working with.

176
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,320
There's lots of different ways you might deal with missing values, especially if you have

177
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
a lot of them.

178
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,680
But we have very few, so there's not much to say.

179
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,180
This isn't really a big best practice, but the documentation has been migrating over

180
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:14,100
to using isna and notna rather than isnull and notnull for consistency with dropna and

181
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
fillna.

182
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,940
That's why I've switched to isna.

183
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,100
You might, I don't know if they'll eventually deprecate the isnull and whatnot, but that's

184
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,540
what I'm doing here.

185
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:30,100
Anyway, that's just a brief intro to this data set.

186
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,740
We're going to jump into the first exercise, which is going to be very short.

187
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,980
Does anyone have any questions up till now?

188
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,980
I'm going to call this.

189
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,700
This exercise is the following question.

190
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:56,700
Which talks provoke the most online discussion?

191
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,300
That, you don't have to type that, you can if you want.

192
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,860
But that's the exercise.

193
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,860
You're going to have to decide which column or columns are relevant to answering this

194
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,860
question.

195
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,860
Some of the columns are self-explanatory, but you can check out the Kaggle website for

196
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,860
descriptions.

197
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:24,860
I will give you about three minutes on this, so that's just because it's not that deep

198
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,860
of an exercise.

199
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,380
But if you've already got an answer, maybe think a little bit beyond the surface as to

200
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,460
what I'm trying to get at.

201
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,460
But I'll be walking around during every exercise and you can ask questions.

202
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:44,460
But go ahead and take three minutes and try to figure out which talks provoke the most

203
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,460
online discussion.

204
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,460
Okay.

205
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,460
Okay.

206
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,460
Okay.

207
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,460
Okay.

208
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,460
Okay.

209
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,460
Okay.

210
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,540
Okay.

211
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,540
All right.

212
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,620
Okay.

213
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,620
Okay.

214
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,620
Okay.

215
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,620
Okay.

216
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,620
Okay.

217
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,620
Subcomments?

218
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,620
Subcomments on other forms?

219
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:36,620
There's a lot of data we do want, but we don't have, and that's an example.

220
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,620
How about there?

221
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,620
Right.

222
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,620
How long it's been online, right?

223
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,620
Because that's really relevant.

224
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,620
Some of these talks have been online for 20 years.

225
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,620
Others have been online for a day.

226
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,620
And so it's relevant how long it's been online.

227
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:02,700
The way I was thinking to correct for this bias is to normalize it by, anyone want to guess?

228
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,700
Views.

229
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,700
Views is what I'm thinking.

230
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,700
So if someone watches a talk, the number of views, if someone watches a talk and they

231
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:16,700
do comment or they don't comment, that would seem to indicate how provocative, if you will,

232
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,700
a talk is.

233
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,700
So I'm going to create a new column called comments per, per, per, per.

234
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,700
View.

235
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,700
And it's going to be Ted.comments divided by Ted.views.

236
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
Okay?

237
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,700
And I'm creating a new column.

238
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,700
I always use dot notation when I can, which I'm using on the right side.

239
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:42,700
You have to use bracket notation when you're creating a new series in a data frame.

240
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,700
Thus, that's why I use bracket notation.

241
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,700
I put underscores in my, in my column names because I like to use dot notation.

242
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,700
So you need underscores there.

243
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,780
So we, I do that.

244
00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:02,780
And then let's go ahead and sort by comments per view instead.

245
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,780
Use comments per view.

246
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:12,780
And we'll look at the tail again.

247
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,780
So now we actually, so that Richard Dawkins talk is still up high.

248
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:26,860
But now we have a different talk we're defining as the most, sorry, I'll scroll over all the way to the right because when you add new columns to a data frame, they end up all the way on the right.

249
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,860
And here's the comments per view column.

250
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,860
And all the way at the bottom, we've got our number.

251
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,860
This is the greatest number in the data frame.

252
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:40,860
So this talk, called the case for same-sex marriage, is a different way you might define, you know, the number of people you might have in your life.

253
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:46,940
So we would interpret this number as for every view of this talk, there are .002 comments.

254
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,940
So that's the greatest number.

255
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:54,940
Though that number is a little bit tricky to kind of put into real world context.

256
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,940
How might I make this more interpretive?

257
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:06,940
So we would interpret this number as for every view of this talk, there are .002 comments.

258
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:13,020
So in real world context, how might I make this more interpretable than what I've got?

259
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:19,020
How might I make this the same information but slightly more interpretable?

260
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,020
Views per comment, that is a great idea, that is exactly what I was thinking.

261
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:35,020
Is we can just reverse the calculation, invert the calculation.

262
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,100
And change this to views per comment.

263
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,100
Views per comment.

264
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
And then it will be Ted.views.

265
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,100
Maybe the copy-paste wasn't the best idea.

266
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,100
Ted.comments.

267
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,100
Sorry, I should have just typed it, that was silly.

268
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,100
All right, views per comment.

269
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,100
All right, looks good.

270
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:07,180
And then we'll do Ted.sort values, views per comment.

271
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,180
Views per comment.

272
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,180
And then this time we'll look at the head because we want the lowest number.

273
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,180
It's the opposite.

274
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:21,180
So now I will just scroll over all the way over here.

275
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,180
And views per comment, it says 450.

276
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:33,260
So it says that it takes 450 views to generate a comment or one out of every 450 people who

277
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:41,260
watches the talk comments on it, which to me is a lot easier to interpret than comments per

278
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,260
view with that small decimal number.

279
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:49,260
So the bottom line for this exercise is this is how I would probably measure with the data

280
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:55,340
we have, which talks provoke the most online discussion, but it would be great to have

281
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,340
other data.

282
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,340
All right, I'm going to show you, I'll just show you on screen a couple lessons I took

283
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,340
away from this, but any questions about this exercise before I do that?

284
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,340
Yeah, please.

285
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,420
All right.

286
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:15,420
When I created this self-explanatory thing for them, I'm interested in, I believe that

287
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,420
the views come from the rating test.

288
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,420
Okay.

289
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,420
I'm thinking about the view from the rating test.

290
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,420
Right.

291
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,420
Oh, okay.

292
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,420
So you, yeah, no, that's fine.

293
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,420
So she basically filtered out a lot of the columns that were irrelevant to the question

294
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,420
before doing kind of a similar process.

295
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:41,500
So yeah, you can always, the problem with kind of like sub data frames is if you create

296
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:47,500
them and then you do any manipulations to it, you haven't affected the one you created in

297
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,500
the original one, so it can be easy to lose track, but sometimes it is nice to create

298
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,500
a smaller data frame that focuses on the columns you're interested in.

299
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Okay.

300
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,500
So I'll just show you the lessons, the lessons I was trying to get across from this exercise.

301
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,580
And these are lessons or best practices.

302
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,580
Some of these will be data science lessons.

303
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,580
Some of them will be pandas lessons.

304
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:13,580
But number one, consider the limitations and biases of your data when analyzing it.

305
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:19,580
So the limitation, as someone mentioned over here, is we only have the first level comments,

306
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,580
whereas actually having those nested comments might actually be even more useful for which

307
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,580
talks are most provocative because people are saying things and then other people are

308
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,580
replying to them.

309
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,660
But we can't really correct for that without gathering the data ourselves.

310
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,660
And then the bias that we tried to correct for was that older talks have had a lot more

311
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:45,660
time to accumulate comments, so we tried to correct for this by normalizing by views.

312
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,660
So that was the first lesson I was trying to get across.

313
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,660
The second lesson is just to make your results understandable, regardless of your audience,

314
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,660
regardless of whether it's just for yourself.

315
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,660
And that's why we used views per comment rather than comments per view.

316
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,740
So those are just a couple lessons.

317
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,740
I hope you found that to be useful.

318
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:07,740
I'm going to move on to the next exercise unless there are any final questions about

319
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,740
this one.

320
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,740
Okay.

321
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,740
All right.

322
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:23,740
So the next exercise is visualize the distribution of the data that you're using.

323
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,820
Visualize the distribution of comments.

324
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,820
Okay.

325
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,820
And we're going to talk about this one for just a few minutes before I let you loose

326
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,820
on this one.

327
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:41,820
So let's just make a plot real quick with pandas.

328
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,820
So we're going to do ted.comments.plot.

329
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,820
All right.

330
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,820
And here's what we get.

331
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,820
What kind of plot is this?

332
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,900
A line plot.

333
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,900
A line plot, that is correct.

334
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,900
So what do the axes represent?

335
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,900
What does the X represent and what does the Y represent?

336
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,900
X is the index.

337
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,900
X is the index.

338
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,900
And what does the Y represent?

339
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,900
The value of the comments field.

340
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,900
Right.

341
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:19,900
So it's basically plotted out 2,550 points and connected them by a line.

342
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,980
That's what a line plot is.

343
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,980
Line plot is not what you would use here because a line plot is for measuring

344
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,980
something over time.

345
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,980
So if there's not a time component to it, in what you're showing, a line plot is

346
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,980
usually not the right choice.

347
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:39,980
I just wanted you to know how to plot using pandas if you haven't done it before.

348
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,980
We can learn some things from this plot.

349
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,980
We can see that many talks have a low number of comments and a small number of talks have

350
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,060
lots of comments.

351
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,060
But that's about it.

352
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,060
So this is not the plot I want you to create.

353
00:25:54,060 --> 00:26:00,060
But you might know, and in a Jupyter Notebook you put your cursor in the parentheses and

354
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:06,060
shift-tab and I'm going to do it four times to pull up the signature, essentially the

355
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,060
doc string in a lower pane.

356
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,060
And you'll see, and it'll be different depending upon which editor you use, but

357
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:16,060
you'll see that there's this kind of thing that you can do.

358
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:22,140
But you'll see that there's this kind argument, okay, the default is line.

359
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:28,140
But if you scroll down, you'll see that there are also other options like bar, bar H,

360
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:34,140
hist, box, KDE, density, area, and pie, okay?

361
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:40,140
So there are many different plot types supported by pandas.

362
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,140
So the exercise is really, again, I want you to visualize the distribution of comments.

363
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,220
So the first step is I want you to figure out what plot to do that.

364
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:54,220
And if you don't know the terminology, you're looking for a plot that summarizes how often

365
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,220
particular values are occurring.

366
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,220
This is called the frequency distribution.

367
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:06,220
And when you've made this, it should be easy to see are there a lot of low values?

368
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,220
Are there a lot of high values?

369
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,220
Okay?

370
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,220
So that's step one is pick a plot type.

371
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:18,300
And step two is once you've picked a plot, I want you to modify the defaults to make it as

372
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,300
informative as possible.

373
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:26,300
So let's pretend you've got one shot to pick the perfect visualization to visualize the

374
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,300
distribution of comments.

375
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,300
I want you to make it as informative as possible.

376
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:36,300
You don't need to add labels, but I want you to modify how it looks so that it's as

377
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,300
informative as possible, okay?

378
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:42,380
So I'm only going to give you about four or five minutes on this, but I'll be walking

379
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,380
around.

380
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,380
I'll leave this doc string up just in case it's helpful to anyone.

381
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,380
And then we'll be back up in a couple minutes to talk about it.

382
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,380
And I'll...

383
00:27:54,380 --> 00:28:04,380
So in the Jupyter Notebook, if you put your cursor within the parentheses, you can hit

384
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,460
Shift-Tab once, and it will pop it up here.

385
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,460
A second time to get it larger, a third time to do I'm not sure what, and a fourth time

386
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,460
to get it to appear at the bottom of your screen.

387
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,460
And then you can hit this X to close it.

388
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,460
So that's how it's done.

389
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,460
Great question.

390
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,460
And I will do that again so that everyone can have it.

391
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,460
All right.

392
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,460
So...

393
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,460
So...

394
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,460
So...

395
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,460
So...

396
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,460
So...

397
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,460
So...

398
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,460
So...

399
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,460
So...

400
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,460
So...

401
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,460
So...

402
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,460
So...

403
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,460
So...

404
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,460
So...

405
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,460
All right.

406
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,460
We're going to go ahead and go through this one.

407
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,460
Hope you had some fun playing with some visualizations.

408
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,460
So...

409
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,460
What plot type did someone choose?

410
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,540
Tell me what plot type you used.

411
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,540
Histogram.

412
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:18,540
So that's kind of when you talk about a frequency distribution, that's kind of the natural thought of...

413
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:25,340
Usually, so a histogram, if you're not familiar, it shows the frequency distribution of a single

414
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,420
numeric variable.

415
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:33,420
And the way it works is it creates 10 equally sized bins by default between the minimum value

416
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:39,420
and the maximum value, divides those into 10 bins, and then it counts how many observations appear

417
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,420
in each bin.

418
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:49,420
So this isn't kind of the end point, but what have we learned so far by looking at this visualization?

419
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:53,420
Where was that?

420
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
What have we learned?

421
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,500
The bins need to be a much greater number of bins.

422
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
There's only 10 bins there.

423
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
So it's going to be by default.

424
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:21,500
If you're going to spread it out, you're going to see basically smaller things.

425
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500
So there are two thoughts I want to get at.

426
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,500
One is adjusting the number of bins, which we'll get to in a minute, that many of you may have

427
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,500
thought about already, and if you haven't or are not familiar, you'll see that.

428
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:39,500
The other thought, which is just to make sure we understand this, this is a bin that starts at zero

429
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,500
and ends at about 600 and something.

430
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:53,580
So this bar represents a lot of talks with between zero and 600 comments.

431
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,580
It's not a lot of talks with zero comments.

432
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,580
So it's not what's at the left.

433
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:03,580
You have to think about the bin itself, which is zero to 600 and something.

434
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:07,580
And we only know that because the max number is 6,000 and something, so when you divide it by 10,

435
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,580
you get 600 and something.

436
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:15,660
So that's the first thing we've learned about the distribution, is that most talks have a lot

437
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,660
fewer than 1,000 or 600 comments.

438
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:25,660
Now, what does this not tell us that we might want to know?

439
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,660
Right.

440
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:37,660
So how are the, what does the distribution look like within that bar?

441
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,740
How does the distribution look like within that first bar or within that subset?

442
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,740
So we've got, the reason we have this kind of weird looking histogram, well, weird in the sense

443
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:51,740
that you've got a lot of what looks like empty space, is because there's a talk with 6,000 and

444
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:55,740
something comments, but that doesn't really tell you anything, and it's artificially spread out

445
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,740
this histogram.

446
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:03,740
So the vast majority of our data is at the left side, and so my thought is that we don't know

447
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:09,820
whether most talks have 5 comments or 500 comments, we just know that most talks have less than 600

448
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,820
comments.

449
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:17,820
So I thought it would be nice to modify this to be more informative by filtering it down.

450
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:23,820
So we're actually going to filter just like this.

451
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,820
Ted Doug's comments is less than 1,000.

452
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,820
Okay?

453
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,820
So we're just filtering out everything above 1,000.

454
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:37,900
So all I did is filter the actual data frame before selecting the comments series, and we've

455
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:43,900
actually only lost a little bit of data, and I'll just show you in a cell above here.

456
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:57,900
So if we do Ted.comments is greater or equal to 1,000, sorry, and we do that dot shape, we can see

457
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:05,980
that when we filter out the ones with 1,000 or greater, we're only losing 32 talks out of 2,500.

458
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,980
Okay?

459
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:13,980
So this is my way of getting at a little more, like this to me is a much more informative plot

460
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,980
because it tells me about most of the data.

461
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,980
It doesn't focus on the outliers.

462
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,980
Okay?

463
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:25,980
Any questions about like how this line of code works or what's going on here?

464
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,060
Okay.

465
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,060
All right.

466
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,060
So before I move on and show you a few more things, I do want to mention that there are

467
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:38,060
different ways you could write this code that would produce an identical plot.

468
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,060
So did anyone use the query method?

469
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,060
Anyone use query?

470
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:48,060
So it's a different way of writing, of filtering your data frame.

471
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:54,060
So you pass it, actually pass it a string, and dot plot kind equals hist.

472
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,140
I think I got that right.

473
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:02,140
So this does exactly the same thing using the query method.

474
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,140
Some people like using query.

475
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:10,140
And then a third way you can write this, and it's the way I like, and sorry to move things off

476
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:18,140
screen, but that's kind of the nature of this, is I use loke a lot instead because I think it is the

477
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:26,220
most flexible and the most, well, to me it's the most readable way because it's very explicit

478
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,220
about which rows do I want and which columns do I want.

479
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,220
So this is not really about plotting.

480
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:36,220
This is just showing you a couple different ways to do the same thing.

481
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,220
So this is with loke.

482
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:46,220
So with loke, I select which rows I want, which columns I want, and then run the, sorry,

483
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:52,300
which rows I want, which column singular I want, and then plot it as a histogram.

484
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,300
Okay?

485
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,300
Yeah, please.

486
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,300
Right, yes.

487
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,300
So loke is great because you can select multiple columns.

488
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,300
You can pass it a single column.

489
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,300
You can pass it a list of columns.

490
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:14,300
You can pass it a range of columns, literally column A colon column C, and it will select A, B,

491
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:22,380
and C, or a Boolean series, and that will at least work for the rows, and I'm actually not sure

492
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,380
about that for the columns, but anyway, yes, there are different ways you can select with loke,

493
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,380
which is quite nice.

494
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,380
Okay.

495
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,380
So the final thing, or well, there's two things left I wanted to show you about this, is what

496
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:40,380
someone over here has already suggested, which is maybe we should increase the number of bins so we

497
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:46,460
can see a little more fine-grained detail, and so instead of sticking with the default of 10 bins,

498
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:52,460
we're going to change it to 20, and now we get a little bit more fine-grained picture, and what

499
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:58,460
we've learned, so now we have 20 bins, each represent, like the first bin is zero to 50

500
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,460
comments, the next bin is 50 to 100 comments, et cetera, et cetera.

501
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:08,460
Now we've learned that the most popular, at least in this context, is 50 to 100 comments,

502
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:12,540
that's more common in this data set than zero to 50.

503
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,540
Yep.

504
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,540
Right.

505
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,540
Right, right, right, yes.

506
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,540
So, and a lot of folks, when they were trying to research the documentation, were like, I don't

507
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:30,540
see all these things I want, and if you did like ted dot something dot hist instead of dot plot,

508
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,540
you would get, you would have more information about the data set, and so that's what we're going

509
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,620
to do, and if you did like ted dot something dot hist instead of dot plot, you would get, you would

510
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,620
have more information about that.

511
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:46,620
So, very briefly, and we can talk about it more after, but briefly, pandas is always calling

512
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:54,620
matplotlib to draw its plots, there are different, there are many different ways to call pandas

513
00:42:54,620 --> 00:43:00,620
plots, there are the generic, like, dot plot kind equals, with a lot of options for keyword

514
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:04,700
arguments, and those keyword arguments ultimately get passed, I think, directly onto matplotlib,

515
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,700
but if you want to know what all those are, you unfortunately have to go to the matplotlib

516
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,700
documentation.

517
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:18,700
The flip side is you can use things like ted dot comments dot hist, which allow things like

518
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:26,700
grouped histograms, but the downside is most plots don't have a, you know, dot hist, I mean,

519
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:32,780
there is dot hist, there is dot box plot, but there's not, I don't think, like dot kde, and

520
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:38,780
there's so many types of plots that there's not a specifically named one, that I like to teach the

521
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:44,780
dot plot generically because it has most of it, but the downside being you have all these kind of

522
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:50,780
hidden keyword arguments that you don't know what you can put in it, and you end up at the matplotlib

523
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:54,780
documentation, like, kind of guessing, like, okay, I think this one will work here, and then you try

524
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:59,580
it, and it usually does work. So, that answer your question? Okay, great, great, great, great, great.

525
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:08,700
The final thing you might think about using here is did anyone try a box plot? So, some box plots,

526
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:18,300
yep, so that's another good way to do distributions, and it's kind equals box, and unfortunately,

527
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:23,420
it doesn't, it's not quite as informative because of what are all the black dots?

528
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:29,660
Outliers, so anything that it defines as an outlier just gets a black dot. There's a ton of things that

529
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:36,700
it shows you, so you can think of this kind of like a, in a sense, it's like a histogram that's

530
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:44,300
been turned vertically, but it's just showing you your quartiles, and then, but it's got so many

531
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,900
outliers that it's not the most informative plot. So, I don't like the box plot in this case,

532
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,620
but sometimes the box plot is kind of what you're looking for.

533
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:02,060
All right, before I jump into some lessons, any, some lessons about what we just

534
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,580
walked through, any questions about this exercise?

535
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:13,820
Okay, and I will say that after the next exercise, which is longer, I'll take a pulse on how we're

536
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:18,940
doing in terms of is this too fast or too slow or somewhere in the middle, but I want to have one

537
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:26,860
longer exercise before you kind of gauge that, so I will be asking just not quite yet. The lessons

538
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:35,500
that I take away from this, from this exercise, number one is you choose your plot type based on

539
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:41,500
the question you're answering and the data types you're working with, so histograms are good for

540
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:48,940
distributions, bar plots are for comparing categories, line plots are good for time series

541
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:56,780
data, scatter plots are for comparing multiple numeric variables, so yeah, you have to choose

542
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:02,700
based upon the type of data you're working with, and pandas actually has a lot more plot types

543
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:08,060
than are represented in that kind equals, so if you're really interested, I would encourage you

544
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:13,900
to read the visualization page of the pandas documentation because it has tons more plots and

545
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:19,420
you call them, unfortunately, in an array of different ways, but there are actually a ton of

546
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:25,100
supported ones, so that was my first lesson. My second kind of takeaway is I like to use pandas

547
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:32,940
one-liners to iterate through plots quickly. As I said, pandas is calling matplotlib under the hood,

548
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:39,500
but it's generally faster and easier to write pandas plots than matplotlib plots, the downside

549
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:46,940
being that this advice is mostly relevant for exploratory plots because there are limits to

550
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:53,900
how much you can customize it without using matplotlib directly. The third lesson I wanted

551
00:46:53,900 --> 00:47:00,060
to impart is just to try modifying the plot defaults because it's rare that the default

552
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:05,580
settings are going to give you exactly the plot that you are looking for, the most informative plot,

553
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:11,660
and the final takeaway, especially for anyone who is uncomfortable with the idea of like,

554
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:19,260
let's just cut out these 32 observations, which is what I did, creating plots involves decision

555
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:24,700
making, in fact a lot of decision making, because you can't show everything on a visualization. A

556
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:31,340
visualization is inherently a summary, so you have to accept that you're not going to show something.

557
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:37,500
There's no single correct way to visualize a certain piece of data, so there's no right or

558
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:43,260
wrong visualization, but there are certainly misleading visualizations, and it's very easy

559
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:50,300
to create a misleading visualization even accidentally, so your decision should be guided

560
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:56,940
around how do I accurately answer this question and not mislead folks as to what's going on in the data.

561
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:05,420
Okay, so those are the takeaways there. I'm going to jump into the next exercise,

562
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:10,860
and this one is going to be, as I mentioned, is going to be longer, and hopefully you will like

563
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:16,300
kind of, if you found those to be easy, then hopefully you'll struggle some, a little bit at

564
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:28,860
least. So this is number four. Plot the number of talks that took place each year. Okay, number four.

565
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:35,260
Plot the number of talks that took place each year, and I choose my words very carefully, so

566
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:43,260
look back at that if you're unclear. I'm not going to give you any advice this time. I do have a

567
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:48,540
bonus for anyone who finishes early. I will just raise your hand and grab me. I am going to give

568
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:57,820
you about 12 minutes for this exercise, okay, and again always grab me while I'm walking around with your questions.

569
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:59,100
So we're at 12 minutes, but I'd like to just see, just a quick show of hands, how many folks would use more time if they had it?

570
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:04,940
Oh, okay, almost everyone. So at least a couple, we'll do at least a couple more minutes and then

571
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:10,860
I'll kind of make a decision, but yeah, ask a neighbor, if you're stuck on one part and you're like,

572
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:16,220
I just can't get, ask a neighbor and see if they can just tell you and then you can move on to the next part, okay.

573
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:48,220
So

574
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,220
yeah, I've gotten that,

575
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:05,260
I've gotten it to group by year, but

576
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:09,660
I think so.

577
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,660
So I got it from the film date.

578
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:15,660
So I think it's a UNIX time stamp.

579
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:26,700
So yeah, I think the UNIX S should be, I don't know why, but I realized the question very quickly in my little program.

580
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:31,100
So

581
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:35,100
yeah,

582
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,100
yeah,

583
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,100
so

584
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:41,100
yeah,

585
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,100
yeah,

586
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,100
yeah,

587
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,100
yeah,

588
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,100
yeah,

589
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,100
yeah,

590
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,100
yeah,

591
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:55,100
yeah,

592
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,500
yeah,

593
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,500
I can't figure out how to

594
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:23,580
know

595
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,100
You got these things.

596
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,100
There's two of them.

597
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,100
This is the first one starting in 1932.

598
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,100
A lot of the movies and others.

599
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,100
But it's also like, this isn't, I don't think it's the sword.

600
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:28,100
Yeah.

601
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,100
All right.

602
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:02,100
This is, I think I'm going to go ahead and cut you off on this one,

603
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:06,100
because there are some sticking points that a lot of people are running into,

604
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:10,100
and I don't know if you'll get it even if I give you like a really long time.

605
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,100
So I don't want to just spend all day.

606
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,100
No, and that's not, I mean, this is hard.

607
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,100
Like, this is hard.

608
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:19,100
If you, you have to know, I mean, I have to guess what you might know,

609
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,100
and that's what I'm using when I create these exercises.

610
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:26,100
So if you don't know certain key things, this would be very, very hard.

611
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:30,100
So anyway, with that being said, let's go through it.

612
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,100
Okay?

613
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,100
Let's see here.

614
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,100
Okay.

615
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:42,100
So what is wrong first with using the event column?

616
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:46,100
Did anyone try the event column, and then they got stuck?

617
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:50,100
Why did, did it work or did it not work?

618
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:54,100
Well, I was able to extract years out of that field.

619
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:55,100
You were?

620
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:58,100
I mean, it's just the last four characters in the field.

621
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,100
Okay.

622
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,100
Meaningful.

623
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:06,100
Now, in what cases would that all, did that always work?

624
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:10,100
And the answer is no, but can someone tell me why the answer is no?

625
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,100
Some of them work.

626
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:15,100
Some of them don't have the year.

627
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:22,100
So this is, if you're not familiar with, like, the random sample method,

628
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,100
that's useful.

629
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:28,100
So, you know, I just want 10 randomly selected events,

630
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:34,100
and you'll see that some of them end with a number that obviously represents the year,

631
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,100
and some of them don't.

632
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:38,100
So if you go to that column, you are going to get stuck.

633
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,100
You're going to have at least a lot of missing values

634
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:43,100
because you're not going to have the year.

635
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:50,100
So what I was hoping you would do is go over to the TED Talks dataset website,

636
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,100
and you would scroll down and you would see Film Date,

637
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:58,100
and you'd see it's the Unix timestamp of the filming,

638
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:03,100
and that sounds like, well, that's when it took place.

639
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:08,100
So that sounds like the right column to focus on.

640
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:11,100
So let's take a look at it.

641
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:20,100
Film Date dot head, okay, and we've got our Unix timestamp, okay.

642
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:24,100
So I look at that and I think, well, I don't really know much about Unix timestamps

643
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:28,100
or what to do with them, but my, you know, pd dot to date time,

644
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:33,100
which was a key function here, if you did not get to pd dot to date time,

645
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:38,100
that was like a big, something you needed to make this easy.

646
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:44,100
So pd dot to date time converts a series to the date time format,

647
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:49,100
and it does a lot of guessing as to what format it is and produces pretty good results.

648
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:54,100
Now, unfortunately, these don't look like good results,

649
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:58,100
which is disappointing because usually you stick in whatever

650
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:02,100
and out comes the real dates, and you're like, wow, that's magical.

651
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:05,100
But in this case, it did not work, okay.

652
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:09,100
So here's what I was hoping you would do, and I know this is a stretch

653
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:12,100
because you'd have to happen to follow this same sequence,

654
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:15,100
but if it was me and you know what to date time is,

655
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:20,100
you would Google pandas to date time, do to date time,

656
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:26,100
and you might go looking to Stack Overflow and you might stumble upon a good answer.

657
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:31,100
But in this case, I would get here because I know I want to use this function.

658
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:35,100
I would search for the word Unix, whoops, Unix,

659
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:39,100
and I would get down at the bottom, I would find this,

660
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:44,100
which is an example of using it to convert something that looks like our timestamps

661
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:47,100
to something that looks like what we want.

662
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:52,100
And all they did was say unit equals s, and magically they got the right thing.

663
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:59,100
So my thought was, well, let's just add unit equals s.

664
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:04,100
And then you get these dates that look like, hey, that looks like the right date.

665
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:11,100
And so what I did, and so if you didn't know about two-day time,

666
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:15,100
getting to this step would be very hard, but if you did,

667
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:19,100
then what I'm hoping you did is created a new column,

668
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:25,100
because it's best not to overwrite your existing column unless you're sure you don't need it.

669
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:33,100
So I'm going to create a new column called film date time with this data.

670
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:38,100
And then they looked like the right dates,

671
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:46,100
but I would want to verify that these are, that this is like, that it worked as we had hoped.

672
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:54,100
So what I'm actually going to do is just pull out two columns, event and film date time.

673
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:59,100
So I'm pulling out the two columns that one is the one I just created,

674
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:03,100
and the other is one that has a name that often includes the year.

675
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:06,100
And I'm just going to randomly sample.

676
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:10,100
And when we do that, you're going to have a different random sample.

677
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:13,100
But you're going to look at it and you're going to say, okay,

678
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:17,100
the 2012 event has a 2012 film date time.

679
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:21,100
Same thing with the 2007 and the 2008 and the 2015.

680
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:24,100
And so you think, okay, that probably did work.

681
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:29,100
So we don't want to assume it worked just because some rows looked like they were correct.

682
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:33,100
It's good to use a random sample to kind of verify your results.

683
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:43,100
Okay. Now, the thing it's done, the we're going to check the D types again of the entire data frame.

684
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:50,100
And the thing it's done is create this new column called film date type.

685
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:54,100
Okay. Sorry. It's created the new column called film date time,

686
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:57,100
and it's using the date time data type.

687
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:03,100
So that's a special pandas data type that is automatically output when you use PD.2 date time.

688
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:11,100
Okay. And just I'm just curious, like how many people this is completely new to them using the okay,

689
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:15,100
at least half of them. Okay. Okay.

690
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:21,100
So the neat thing, so basically, if you want to get a, I'll show you,

691
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:24,100
you'll see why you want to have date time data types.

692
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:35,100
But any time you use PD.2 date time and pass it something, it will output a date time column.

693
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,100
And that's useful for a lot of reasons.

694
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:43,100
And I'll show you one reason right now, which is Ted, if I select film date time,

695
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:51,100
then I have this little DT namespace and I can select convenient attributes like year.

696
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:57,100
Okay. I can select day of week, I think is one.

697
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:01,100
I can select day of year.

698
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:07,100
And all these convenient attributes are available under this little .dt namespace

699
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:10,100
because it's the date time data type.

700
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:14,100
Okay. So this is the easiest way to get the year.

701
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:20,100
There are other solutions to this exercise, but this is a good one.

702
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:27,100
So now we've got this .dt.year.

703
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:32,100
Now, if you're like, wait, that looks kind of familiar.

704
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:39,100
This is the same as like string methods have this little str namespace, like str.lower.

705
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:44,100
So if you want to do string methods on a series that's a string,

706
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:49,100
you do column.str.string method name and it will do it.

707
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:55,100
In the same way with date time data types, you have this little DT namespace

708
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:59,100
with a variety of convenient attributes you can pull out.

709
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:05,100
Okay. So I've got this year data.

710
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:12,100
How, so I've got everything I need in this column, year, which is what we were going after.

711
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:19,100
How do we count the number of talks per year from where we are here?

712
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:22,100
Value counts, whoever said that.

713
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:27,100
The value counts method is good anytime you want to count values.

714
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:31,100
Okay. Now we've got our value counts.

715
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:35,100
And now that we've got the data that we're looking for,

716
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,100
which is the number of talks that took place each year,

717
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:45,100
what kind of plot do we probably want to use?

718
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:54,100
Bar plot is one suggestion. Anyone want to offer an alternative?

719
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,100
Someone said histogram, someone said line plot.

720
01:14:56,100 --> 01:15:06,100
Okay. So a bar plot is okay, but there are two things, well, let's just, okay, let's do it.

721
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:08,100
And then we'll talk about it for a second.

722
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:14,100
And whoops, obviously I need to actually dot plot.

723
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:18,100
Sorry. Value counts dot plot.

724
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:22,100
Okay. So we get this and yes, we can fix up the sorting.

725
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:29,100
But the thing, there are kind of the main issue here with using a bar plot other than sorting,

726
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:37,100
which we can fix, is that it's excluding all the years that did not get, that are not in the data.

727
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:41,100
So there was no talk in 1973, but there was in 1972.

728
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:50,100
But a plot that misses those time spans is a little bit misleading because you can't see the jumps.

729
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:53,100
Now bar plots are best for categorical data.

730
01:15:53,100 --> 01:16:02,100
And technically you could consider years to be categories, but they're not really, and, or it's not optimal.

731
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:08,100
And a line plot is better because line plots are four things that are plotted over time.

732
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:12,100
Okay. So a line plot is better in this case.

733
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:16,100
So what I'm going to do, the line plot is the default.

734
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:19,100
So I'm just going to run this.

735
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:23,100
And I want you to tell me what went wrong here.

736
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:28,100
So this is not the answer, but what went wrong?

737
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:34,100
Someone, something about sorting and who can tell me more?

738
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:44,100
Tell me a general principle about why this plot looks the way it is.

739
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:48,100
Like what is it doing that is non-optimal?

740
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:54,100
Yes. Why is it doing that is the question.

741
01:16:54,100 --> 01:17:02,100
It is, yes, it is forming a continuous line, but there's something more to it.

742
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:09,100
That's actually not the case. Over here.

743
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,100
It's not plotting along the wrong axis.

744
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:20,100
These are great. Obviously this is a great question because I'm not getting the right answer.

745
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:29,100
Right. Okay. So it is a sorting issue and let's look at the data.

746
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:32,100
Okay. Let's look at the data.

747
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:38,100
If I take this and I give it to dot plot, which produces a line plot,

748
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:42,100
pandas will plot them in the order in which they appear.

749
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:46,100
So it will first plot 2013 to 70.

750
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:49,100
Then it'll plot 2011 to 20.

751
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:55,100
Then it'll plot 2011 to 70 and connect it.

752
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:58,100
Then it'll plot 2010 to 67.

753
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:04,100
And if you actually follow this, you'll see that that is why it produces this plot.

754
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:08,100
So it plots things in the order you give it to them.

755
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:16,100
Okay. Now if we want to fix this, we're just going to do sort index.

756
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:19,100
Okay. So we're going to throw in sort index.

757
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:22,100
Actually let me show you that before the plot.

758
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:26,100
Sort index sorts the index, which is the thing on the left,

759
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:29,100
not the values, which is the thing on the right.

760
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:35,100
So you want to sort the index because the index is going to become the x-axis

761
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,100
and the values are going to become the y-axis.

762
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:43,100
But because it's connecting the points, you need those points to be in order.

763
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:50,100
So when we do that, we get the plot that I was actually looking for.

764
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:56,100
So this is one way to go about getting this particular plot.

765
01:18:56,100 --> 01:19:00,100
And there are others, but we could talk about that all day.

766
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:04,100
I do have one question though.

767
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:10,100
Is the number of talks on a sharp decline?

768
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:13,100
You say no, and why do you say no?

769
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:16,100
Probably just the last year in the conclusion.

770
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:18,100
Right. So there's some incomplete data.

771
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:24,100
So you don't want to draw a conclusion that there is a big drop

772
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:27,100
just because there's a drop in the plot,

773
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:33,100
because it turns out that if you use film datetime.max,

774
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:38,100
so you can use things like max and min with your datetime data types,

775
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:43,100
and you see that this data ends in the middle of 2017,

776
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:49,100
which is why we have incomplete data for this particular year.

777
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:54,100
Yeah, please.

778
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,100
Sorry, say that one more time.

779
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:59,100
Okay.

780
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:03,100
Good question. In this case, it would not.

781
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:09,100
And there's a different way, so there's multiple ways you can go about.

782
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:16,100
There are, if you're familiar, anyone familiar with resample?

783
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:18,100
Resample? Okay.

784
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:21,100
So I won't go into it because I don't want to stray too far,

785
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:25,100
but resample is another way you could solve this problem.

786
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:28,100
Essentially, you resample it by year,

787
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:31,100
and then you do a count of observations of any column,

788
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:34,100
and you'll end up with roughly the same plot,

789
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:39,100
except it will handle zero years slightly differently,

790
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:42,100
which is probably slightly better,

791
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:46,100
but it depends on what exactly you're trying to show.

792
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:57,100
Oh, interesting. Okay.

793
01:20:57,100 --> 01:21:03,100
So there aren't any missing values in this case,

794
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:06,100
so a zero isn't a missing...

795
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:10,100
There are no observations 2010.

796
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:11,100
Right.

797
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,100
In that series.

798
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:17,100
Okay, got it. Got it, got it, got it. Yes.

799
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:20,100
So I don't know how plotting...

800
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:23,100
I think plotting would just...

801
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:26,100
I'm actually not sure how plotting would handle a missing value

802
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,100
in that case, but it's a great question.

803
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:31,100
I just don't happen to know.

804
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:34,100
Other questions about this particular exercise,

805
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:37,100
and then I'll go through some lessons. Yeah, please.

806
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,100
So I'm a little confused.

807
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:41,100
See, this is a plot that I had before,

808
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:44,100
and I'm doing a plot for 2006.

809
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,100
Right.

810
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:51,100
So I created that by mapping the daytime function to that row,

811
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:54,100
and I'm a little confused about why those two things

812
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:56,100
didn't get different results.

813
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,100
When I looked up the doctrine of meaning for what I did,

814
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:02,100
I was learning a unique timestamp for the same object.

815
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:03,100
Okay.

816
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:09,100
So your question is essentially you're wondering why yours ended up

817
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,100
without anything below 2006.

818
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,100
Yeah.

819
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:13,100
Okay.

820
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,100
Let me take a look at your code during the break

821
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,100
and see if I can figure it out, but...

822
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:19,100
I was going to say I had the same issue.

823
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,100
Okay.

824
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,100
Publish date instead of...

825
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:24,100
Oh, you use publish date.

826
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:27,100
Okay, that might be it.

827
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:30,100
So publish date and film date are actually different,

828
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:32,100
though I don't know how far back the publish dates go.

829
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:33,100
Oh, okay.

830
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:34,100
Well, that solves it.

831
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:37,100
So that is a tricky little piece of...

832
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:43,100
It's why I phrased it as the number of talks that took place each year

833
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,100
so that you would kind of choose a certain way,

834
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:47,100
but it's an easy mistake to make.

835
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:49,100
Other questions?

836
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:51,100
Yeah, please.

837
01:22:51,100 --> 01:23:00,100
What's the name of it from...?

838
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,100
Okay.

839
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:06,100
Got it.

840
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,100
Okay.

841
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:09,100
So it is probably...

842
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,100
So most things in Pandas,

843
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:15,100
as long as you're calling them directly and not through apply,

844
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:17,100
which we'll talk about later,

845
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:21,100
are going to be more efficient than anything else

846
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:24,100
you can just pick out of a different library

847
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:27,100
because Pandas overall is well optimized.

848
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:29,100
So it's probably less efficient,

849
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:35,100
but it's more that the functionality in two-day time is really nice,

850
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:38,100
and I know it works really well, and there's a ton of options.

851
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,100
Now, there might be more or less options

852
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:42,100
in the library you're mentioning,

853
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:45,100
so sometimes you might need to use it,

854
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:49,100
but in this case, all we needed was to say unit equals second,

855
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,100
and we got what we needed.

856
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:53,100
But great question.

857
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:57,100
Other questions about this one?

858
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,100
Okay.

859
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:02,100
So a couple lessons, and then let's see.

860
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:04,100
Okay.

861
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:08,100
A couple lessons I wanted to go through as to some takeaways.

862
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:12,100
And first takeaway is read the documentation.

863
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:15,100
So in this case, the documentation for the data set

864
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:20,100
as well as the Pandas documentation would both be useful to you,

865
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:23,100
so it's a good resource to use.

866
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:28,100
The second lesson is to use the date-time data type for dates and times.

867
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:31,100
So number one, it works well with plots.

868
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:35,100
Number two, it provides convenient attributes.

869
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:39,100
And Pandas actually has extensive, extensive functionality

870
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:42,100
for working with time series data,

871
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:47,100
but that functionality depends upon you using these specialized data types.

872
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:50,100
So the takeaway here is if you have date and time data,

873
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:56,100
it will serve you well to use the date-time data type.

874
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:59,100
Lesson number three is check your work as you go.

875
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:02,100
So hopefully, you know, I use the random sample method

876
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:06,100
in order to spot check that certain conversions are working properly

877
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:09,100
rather than just looking at like the head or the tail.

878
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:11,100
I like to use a random sample.

879
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:15,100
And then the fourth point here is to consider excluding data

880
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,100
if it might not be relevant.

881
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:22,100
So as we saw, we only have partial data for 2017.

882
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:25,100
You might want to consider excluding that.

883
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:28,100
It depends on what you're trying to show.

884
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:33,100
It turns out that some of the talks from the TED website,

885
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:36,100
which is this is it was scraped from the TED website,

886
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:41,100
some of the talks on the TED website actually were not TED talks.

887
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:43,100
They're just like talks that they uploaded

888
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:46,100
because they thought they were really TED-like talks.

889
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:51,100
The TED conference was actually founded in 1984, not in 1972.

890
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:54,100
So you might want to consider, like,

891
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:57,100
if someone asked you this question for work for some reason,

892
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:59,100
it might be a good idea to research,

893
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:02,100
oh, are all the talks in the data set actually TED talks?

894
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:08,100
And do I want to include data that is non-TED talks on the TED website?

895
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:12,100
And that would depend on what question you're trying to answer.

896
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:15,100
So, yeah, that's really all I want to say about that

897
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:19,100
is sometimes the data you have, you should exclude certain things

898
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:22,100
depending upon what you are trying to get across.

899
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:24,100
Okay?

900
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,100
All right. Yeah, please.

901
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:28,100
Question about H time conversion.

902
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:32,100
Is there a way to do the dot notation on the arbitrary integer

903
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:37,100
treated as an epoch time dot the as type of H?

904
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:42,100
Oh, he's asking if you can do conversion using, like, as type

905
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:45,100
in the same way that you have a column of strings that says,

906
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:48,100
like, it's a string of the number 3,

907
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:50,100
you can just do, like, as type int,

908
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:53,100
and it will become an integer column.

909
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:57,100
I think it would be a good thing if there was, like, as type date time,

910
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:00,100
but as far as I know, that does not work.

911
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:05,100
There's no, like, as type does not support that particular conversion.

912
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:10,100
So you have to use this PD.2 date time, which is this top level method.

913
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:13,100
It's not like a series method or a data frame method.

914
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:16,100
It's just this top level function, actually.

915
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:19,100
Other questions?

916
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:21,100
Okay.

917
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:25,100
So let's see.

918
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:27,100
I think what we're going to do...

919
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:31,100
So we've got 12 minutes till the break.

920
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:35,100
So I'm going to start you on the next exercise,

921
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:39,100
and I think I'll just let you go to the break working on that,

922
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:42,100
and then we'll talk about it afterwards.

923
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,100
It might put us slightly behind,

924
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,100
but I may start talking about it before if I feel like it.

925
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:51,100
So anyway, you're going to have at least eight minutes for this one,

926
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:56,100
and let me go ahead and type it out and let you get started.

927
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:59,100
Okay, this is number five.

928
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:01,100
Oops. Five.

929
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:09,100
What were the best events in TED history to attend?

930
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:12,100
Okay. What were the... Sorry.

931
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:15,100
What were the best events in TED history to attend?

932
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:19,100
And I'm not asking about the best individual talks.

933
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:21,100
I'm asking about the best event,

934
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:25,100
that event column that's like TED 2006, TED whatever.

935
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:29,100
So what was the best event in TED history to attend?

936
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:33,100
And it's your job to figure out how to define best

937
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:38,100
and then use that definition to calculate which event was best.

938
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:39,100
Okay?

939
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:41,100
So I'm going to give you at least eight minutes,

940
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:44,100
but I will more likely give you until the break at three o'clock

941
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:46,100
and then we'll discuss it after.

942
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:50,100
And if anyone finishes early, I have a bonus you can work on.

943
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:53,100
But yeah, go ahead and get started.

944
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:16,100
Okay.

945
01:29:44,100 --> 01:30:07,100
Okay.

946
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:10,100
Okay.

947
01:30:37,100 --> 01:31:04,100
Okay.

948
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:07,100
Okay.

949
01:31:34,100 --> 01:32:01,100
Okay.

950
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:18,100
Let me give one quick piece of advice.

951
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:24,100
Is start with a simple-ish solution.

952
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:28,100
If you have multiple ideas, try to execute a simple one first

953
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:32,100
and then increase your complexity just in case you're heading down

954
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:35,100
a path and you decide you don't want to be there.

955
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:40,100
So just start with simple and then add on complexity if you like.

956
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:42,100
Yeah, I'll just leave it at that.

957
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:01,100
Okay.

958
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:42,100
Okay.

959
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:45,100
Okay.

960
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:15,100
Okay.

961
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:45,100
Okay.

962
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:15,100
Okay.

963
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:45,100
Okay.

964
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:15,100
Okay.

965
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:59,100
Okay.

966
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:01,100
Just give you a preview.

967
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:03,100
So it's 2.57 right now.

968
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:05,100
So the break is from 3 to 3.20.

969
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:10,100
I'm not going to talk before 3.20, but at 3.20 sharp,

970
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:14,100
I'm going to start and I'm going to start explaining this exercise.

971
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:17,100
So if you need still more time on this,

972
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:20,100
then feel free to work on it a bit during the break.

973
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:25,100
But you're welcome now or in two minutes at the start of the break to head out.

974
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:28,100
But we are starting back at 3.20 promptly.

975
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:54,100
Okay.

976
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:57,100
Okay.

977
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:27,100
Okay.

978
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:57,100
Okay.

979
01:38:57,100 --> 01:39:00,100
Okay.

980
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:03,100
Okay.

981
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:06,100
Okay.

982
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:09,100
Okay.

983
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:12,100
Okay.

984
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:15,100
Okay.

985
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:18,100
Okay.

986
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:21,100
Okay.

987
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:24,100
Okay.

988
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:27,100
Okay.

989
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:30,100
Okay.

990
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:33,100
Okay.

991
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:36,100
Okay.

992
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:39,100
Okay.

993
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:42,100
Okay.

994
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:45,100
Okay.

995
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:48,100
Okay.

996
