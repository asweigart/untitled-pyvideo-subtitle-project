00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,680
Hey, everyone. Let's get started. Our speaker right now is Lauren Schaefer with Does Remote

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:31,200
Work Really Work. Hey, welcome, everyone. I want to begin by asking you to think about

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,800
a time that you were fabulously productive. I mean, you were in the zone. Maybe you were

4
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,080
sitting at your desk, at your office, you had your headphones on, and you were nailing

5
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,760
it. I mean, the code was going directly from your mind to your fingertips. You weren't

6
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,200
having to check stack overflow every five minutes, you weren't introducing bugs, things

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:58,800
were actually working well. Maybe you felt like a pop star. And then you got the dreaded

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,200
tap on the shoulder. And somebody said, I'm going to let you finish, but first, I've got

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,800
to ask you a question. And maybe it was something that was really important, right? Like maybe

10
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,440
everything had crashed in production and you were the only person who could solve it. Or

11
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,400
maybe they just wanted to talk about their latest Game of Thrones theory episode. I mean,

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,280
like, maybe it really wasn't that important. Either way, you answered their question, they

13
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,600
went on their way, and you were left sitting there like, what? Where was I? What was I

14
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,680
working on? And maybe you're going to try to get back in the zone. Or maybe you've got

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,400
a meeting in 25 minutes, so it's not even worth the effort of trying to get back in

16
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:47,360
that zone. You've lost a huge chunk of productivity. And that's why open office spaces can be the

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:55,640
worst, right? You get those drive-by distractions. Oh, yes, thank you. Thank you. I did not pay

18
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,120
him. I appreciate that, though. Right? You've got those drive-by distractions. You don't

19
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,960
really have any privacy. It can be tough. And cube land can also be the worst. You've

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,120
got that illusion of privacy, but you still kind of have to be quiet. People will glare

21
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,800
at you if you're noisy. It can be a problem. Now, I'm a huge advocate for remote work,

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,600
as you'll find out throughout this talk. But to be fair, working remotely can also be the

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,160
worst. I don't know if you guys remember a couple years ago, there was a guy who took

24
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:34,640
an interview for the BBC from his home office. You remember it, right? Okay. Well, for those

25
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,880
of you who don't remember it, this is what happened. Scandals happen all the time. The

26
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,800
question is how do democracies respond to those scandals? And what will it mean for

27
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,000
the wider region? I think one of your children has just walked in. I mean, shifting sands

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,040
in the region. Do you think relations with the north may change? I would be surprised

29
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:11,360
they do. The, pardon me. My apologies. What rules is going to be for the region? My apologies.

30
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:20,880
North Korea, South Korea's policy choices on North Korea have been severely limited in the

31
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,600
last six months to a year. Okay. How great is that mom, though? Okay. So I think we can probably

32
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:34,880
all agree that in that particular moment, that guy failed at working remotely. Right? So today

33
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,640
we're going to be answering the question, does remote work really work? And some of you sitting

34
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,280
in here are probably pretty skeptical. I mean, you've seen videos like that. And maybe you think

35
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,560
it's not possible for people to be as productive or as collaborative or as innovative when they

36
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,800
work remotely. So we're going to examine that and take a look at what the research says.

37
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,760
Some of you might be interested in working remotely, but your company does not have a

38
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,200
remote work policy and you think there's no way my boss is ever going to let me work remotely.

39
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,200
So we'll talk about how you can convince your boss that remote work is a great option.

40
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,520
And finally, some of you here probably want to try remote work. Or maybe you've tried it and you

41
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,320
failed. Or maybe you're a manager of people who work remotely or want to work remotely,

42
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,960
but you're not sure how to be successful. So we're going to talk about some very practical

43
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,960
steps that you can take to be a successful remote employee. My hope is that by the end of the

44
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,680
session, you'll be able to answer the question for yourself, does remote work really work?

45
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,520
So to begin, we're going to start out, I want to share my story with you, why I work remotely.

46
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,280
And to do that, we're going to travel back in time to 2008. It was a simpler time. Tina Fey was

47
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,640
amusing us all with her impressions of Sarah Palin. We all thought rickrolling someone was

48
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:01,920
hilarious. And Beyonce was encouraging men to put a ring on it. And that summer, my boyfriend at

49
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,360
the time did just that. He proposed. And I said yes. And we were young and in love and life was

50
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,520
great. And we decided that, you know, we wanted to get married, obviously. We wanted to live

51
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,640
together. And the problem was that I was a computer scientist and he was a nuclear engineer. So

52
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,120
that's obviously not a problem. But it was a problem eventually. So we did get along. Okay.

53
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,360
So we had our internships that summer. And life was good. We came back. And I ended up interviewing

54
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,600
with IBM, who I had interned for. And I ended up getting three job offers at IBM, which is a

55
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,720
fantastic problem to have, right? No complaints here. The problem was that the nuclear engineering

56
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,000
recruiting cycle didn't start until the following spring. And nuclear engineers don't have a lot of

57
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,120
job options. And the few job options that they have are in very specific cities. You have to kind

58
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,480
of live where the nuclear power plant is. So I found myself in this awkward position of saying,

59
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,720
ultimately, I want to live with my husband, right? But I don't know where he's going to be

60
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,400
able to get a job. Maybe he'll be able to get a job in Raleigh where we had been living and I got

61
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,960
these job offers. But maybe not. So I decided to put my cards on the table and I called these

62
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,600
hiring managers up and I said, you know, I can commit to work for you in the office for a year.

63
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,360
But after that, I really don't know. Maybe I'll be able to stay in Raleigh. Maybe I'm going to move.

64
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,600
What are my options? Will you let me work from home? And one of the managers was like, no,

65
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,240
that's not going to happen. One of the managers was like, maybe it depends on your performance

66
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,040
and how your team lead feels. And one of the managers was like, yeah, that's no big deal at all.

67
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,360
So it was a very easy decision. I didn't care about the technology. I didn't care about the

68
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,680
team. I just wanted the manager that was going to let me work remotely. So I accepted the job offer.

69
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,840
Life was good. My fiance got a job offer in Maryland. So we were very excited for him.

70
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,800
And we realized, okay, we're going to make this work. So we went back to school. We got our

71
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,360
graduate degrees. Life was good. And we split up. So I stayed in Raleigh. We didn't split up

72
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,840
forever. We split physically locations. Okay. So you guys get up here and talk and you find

73
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:25,520
how your words come out. Okay. So I stayed in Raleigh. He went to Maryland. And I went and

74
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,800
worked in Cubeland for a year. And to be honest with you, Cubeland was not for me. The walls were

75
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,600
very gray. It felt a little drab. I didn't have any sunlight. There were people in the office.

76
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,880
Sometimes I talked to them. Sometimes I didn't. If I yelled down the hallway to a friend, people

77
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,400
glared at me. It was kind of horrible. So Cubeland was not great. So after a year of Cubeland,

78
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,480
I was excited to get out. So we got married. We were all excited. And I was ready to work remotely.

79
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,840
But the first six months, working remotely was the worst. It was a real struggle for me. There

80
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,880
were so many life adjustments that happened at the same time. I went from being in the office with

81
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:11,280
people to really not seeing anybody. I went from having lots of local friends to really having one

82
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,160
set of couple friends. I went from the busyness and excitement of planning a wedding to having

83
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,920
really nothing major going on in my life. My life changed in a big way and I wasn't really happy

84
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,680
about it. The first two teams I was a part of when I worked remotely. I was one of the few remote

85
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,640
employees where everybody else was co-located. And on one of those teams, the team was in Switzerland,

86
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,920
so we had a big time zone issue. So I would meet with two of the team leads about once a week for

87
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,200
an hour. And that was all that I talked to them. I knew I was missing out on conversations. I knew

88
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,720
I was not working on the most important part of the product. I was working on things they could

89
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,840
just easily silo off to me. It was a struggle. I didn't really talk to people during the day.

90
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:58,080
When Jason would come home, I would just talk his ear off. On another team I was on, I was in charge

91
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,440
of running the build verification tests. I was in charge of building them, managing and running them.

92
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:11,280
This was before DevOps was a normal thing. We had our overnight build. I would get on at 6.30 in the

93
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,640
morning to run the tests with the hope of getting them finished before the team came online at 9 a.m.

94
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,880
Most days life was good. But you guys know overnight builds, they don't always pass, right?

95
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,680
On those days, the team would keep fixing them and keep fixing them. I had to keep checking in

96
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,040
all day long to see if the build had passed. On those days I would skip the gym and I would just

97
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,800
keep checking in. I found myself burning out. I actually found myself really unpassionate about

98
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,600
my work. And I used to daydream about having a kid so it would be socially acceptable to quit.

99
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,920
Not so great. But after about six months, I figured out how to be a successful remote employee.

100
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,120
And working remotely became the best. Over time, my career began to gain momentum.

101
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,000
I began to switch teams so I could learn new skills and work on new projects.

102
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,840
I began to speak at conferences like this one. Several years ago, I was speaking at a birds of

103
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,520
a feather session for remote employees. And an IBM exec came up to me and she said, you know,

104
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,560
I think you should start a work from home networking group for IBM employees. And that was a

105
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,240
little scary for me at the time, but I went for it and the group eventually grew to 11,000 people

106
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,400
under my leadership. This was a huge leadership opportunity for me that I would have never

107
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:34,240
otherwise gotten. I was even able to participate in the IBM corporate service core where I spent

108
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,440
four weeks in Kenya. It was such a cool opportunity working for a local school there. So I started

109
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,480
to get all this career momentum. And after eight years as a software engineer at IBM, I switched

110
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,960
to Sugar CRM and I was a developer advocate there for a little over a year. And then this past

111
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,720
November, I moved to MongoDB and I'm a developer advocate here. And I love it. I've been remote

112
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,880
since 2010 and I don't see myself ever going back into an office. I truly love remote work.

113
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,160
So some of you might be wondering how I was able to make that shift of how I went from

114
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,160
being the worst to the best. And we're going to get to that. We'll talk about how to be a

115
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,560
successful remote employee. But first, I want to talk about you. So some of you in here, maybe

116
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,520
you want to work remotely or you've got friends or coworkers who work remotely or maybe you manage

117
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,080
people who want to work remotely. And I want to talk about what some of those motivations are.

118
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:34,080
Why would people want to work remotely? Some people like me might be unable to relocate due

119
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,520
to a spouse's job or maybe they just don't want to pull their kids out of high school.

120
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,080
Some people want to avoid lengthy commutes. I mean, 45 minutes to an hour of stop and go traffic

121
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,120
is soul sucking. And time you're not spending commuting is time you can spend with your family

122
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,720
or on your hobbies or sleeping, right? Who doesn't need more sleep? So some people want to be

123
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,480
physically available for children or aging parents. They don't necessarily need to be hands on with

124
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,080
them. They just need to be in the same physical location in case there's an emergency. Some people

125
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,920
like me find the open office environments very distracting. And this last reason is by far my

126
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,600
favorite. I've known people who have actually rented out or sold their homes and traveled the

127
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,800
world while continuing to make a full-time salary. There are actually programs now that facilitate

128
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,400
this. So you can sign up for like a six month or a one year program and you continue on with your

129
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,280
same job. But the program facilitates all of your travel for you. So they handle your lodging,

130
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,920
your transportation and even your activities while you're there. So you can keep working

131
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,360
your same amazing job and you get to experience the world. It's so cool.

132
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,520
So those are some of the reasons why employees want to work remotely.

133
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,760
But why would employers want to offer these options, right? It seems like it would be so

134
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,280
much easier to manage employees if you can physically see them every day. I've got a few

135
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,360
reasons. I'll move through quickly here. So one of the biggest reasons is that you can attract and

136
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:06,160
retain top talent from anywhere in the world. If you're trying to get people to come to your

137
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,720
office in one spot or a few spots around the world, you've got a limited talent pool, right?

138
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,080
You've got to find people who already live there or who are willing to live there. But when you

139
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:22,720
open up to a global talent pool, you've got so many more options. Also you can increase employee

140
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,080
morale. Employees like to have the option of where they want to work. You can save money, right?

141
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:34,240
Employers love to save money. So you can have smaller or no office space. You don't have to

142
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,560
pay to relocate employees. And finally, you can increase employee productivity. And this might

143
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,800
seem a little counterintuitive to you. We'll get into the research in a few minutes. But here's a

144
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,120
couple reasons why. One, you've got fewer sick days. You know, if you're not feeling good, it's

145
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,160
a lot easier to waddle down to your home office than it is to get yourself pretty and get to the

146
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,480
office. Confession, I've had pink eye this year. Not once, not twice, but three times. And I didn't

147
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,480
have to miss any days of work to do that because I didn't have to worry about infecting anybody else.

148
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,360
Remote employees take shorter breaks. We don't get distracted by those, you know, side by

149
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,120
side line conversations. And there are just fewer distractions.

150
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,720
Okay. So some of you are probably sitting here going, this sounds good. I know I'm sitting here

151
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,640
talking to a bunch of engineers and you're like, okay, let's get to the data. What does the research

152
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,640
say? I've got you. Okay. So we're going to start out with the 2019 Stack Overflow developer survey.

153
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,760
I'm guessing many of you filled it out. But if you're not familiar with it, it's a survey put on

154
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:41,360
by the people who run Stack Overflow. And they try to target a diverse set of developers from all over

155
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,960
the world. And they ask a lot of questions like what languages do you like? What database do you

156
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,560
most want to use? The answer is MongoDB. Okay. I had to throw that in there. And they ask a lot of

157
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,160
workplace options. So let's highlight some of those workplace questions. So first they asked,

158
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,880
where do developers want to work? Well, about 60% of developers want to work in the office. But about

159
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,640
40% want to work from home or another place such as a coworking space or cafe. So that's a pretty

160
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:17,760
big chunk of developers who want to have a remote work option. Next, they asked developers, how often

161
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,240
do you want to work remotely? So up at the top, we see people who pretty much never get to work

162
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,240
remotely. In the middle is sometimes down towards the bottom is full-time remote. So you can see up

163
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,960
at the top, we've got 43% of developers never get to work remotely. And down towards the bottom,

164
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:39,920
we've got 12% who get to work remotely full-time. One interesting stat that they pulled out of this

165
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:46,000
is they found that developers who work remotely full-time have on average about 60% more years of

166
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,760
professional coding experience than those who never do. So we can kind of guess why that is.

167
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,840
If you've got more coding experience, you've got a little more leverage. Or maybe you've just built

168
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,520
up more trust with your team. So for whatever the reason, the more experience you have, the more

169
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:08,000
likely you are to be able to be working remotely. Last question I'm going to hit from this survey,

170
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,520
they asked developers to identify their top three greatest challenges to productivity.

171
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,840
So everybody could pick three. I'm going to highlight just two for you. So up at the top,

172
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,520
41% of developers, the number one greatest challenge of productivity is a distracting work

173
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,840
environment. And I think you all have experienced it. I know that you have. You applauded when we

174
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,480
talked about open office spaces being the worst, right? They're rough. And then down towards the

175
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,680
bottom, we see time spent commuting. And some remote employees do commute. But that's something

176
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:44,000
that can be completely eliminated through remote work. All right. So let's dive into a research

177
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,400
study. So in 2014, a study was published in the quarterly journal of economics. So this is a

178
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,240
journal paper, which is generally higher than a conference paper. This is very well received,

179
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,320
a peer-reviewed study. And the researchers worked with Ctrip, which is a Chinese travel agency with

180
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:07,360
16,000 employees. And they focused in on their call center employees. And they said, who of you

181
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,360
would like to work remotely? And of those who said yes, they split them in half. So they said,

182
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,800
half, you have to stay in the office. Half of you can work from home. What's so great about this is

183
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,680
this is an actual controlled study, right? Everybody had the same motivation. Everyone who

184
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,800
participated wanted to work remotely. And then so we're able to very clearly see the results that

185
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:37,120
they found were attributed to workplace locations. So here's what they found. They found a 13%

186
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:44,320
performance increase in work from home employees. That's pretty good, right? So why is that? 9% of

187
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,920
that was from working more minutes per shift. So if you're like me, you're thinking, okay, a shift

188
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,720
is a given amount of time. How can you work more minutes per shift? Well, they said that remote

189
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,680
employees took fewer breaks and fewer sick days. So we talked about that a little bit, right? So

190
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,000
they're actually sitting, they're getting more butt in seat time because they're a remote employee.

191
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,560
The other 4% of that 13% was from taking more calls per minute. So these are call center

192
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,720
employees. It's very important that they can hear the person they're talking to and the person on

193
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,240
the other line can hear them. So they had a quieter work environment that was more conducive to

194
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,960
getting their work done and they found a significant increase from that. They also found a

195
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,080
statistically significant higher work satisfaction in work from home employees. This is great, right?

196
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:41,920
Happy employees, happy life. Related to that, they found a 50% reduction in attrition rate in work

197
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,760
from home employees. This is huge, right? Attrition is a major problem. When people leave, they take

198
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:54,240
their tribal knowledge with them. It costs money to recruit and hire new employees. So if you can

199
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,800
reduce your attrition rate by 50%, that is a major cost savings. One downside that they found

200
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,200
is they found a 50% reduction in promotion rate conditional on performance for work from home

201
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,840
employees. So work from home employees were not being promoted as quickly. Why is that?

202
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,680
They had three major reasons they suggested. First, the age old, out of sight, out of mind,

203
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:24,240
you're not being thought about for promotion. Secondly, so a lot of times in the engineering

204
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,280
world, we've got like individual contributor one, individual contributor two, and you can kind of

205
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,360
move up the ladder that way. This was not the case here. If you were a call center employee and you

206
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,360
wanted to be promoted, you were being promoted to a team lead or a management position. So they said

207
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,080
that the work from home employees lacked opportunities to develop their interpersonal skills,

208
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:51,120
which was a crucial part of being promoted. And they also found that promotion, since it required

209
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,520
a return to the office, many of the work from home employees may not have even been interested in the

210
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:02,320
promotion, so they may not have been putting themselves up for it. All right. So last stat

211
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,720
from this, this is a really cool one. So I mentioned that at the beginning they had a 13%

212
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,240
performance increase. So after nine months, they said, yes, this is working. We're going to let

213
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,560
people work wherever they want. So some of the work from home employees went back into the office.

214
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,000
Some of the office employees decided to work from home. And they measured their productivity again

215
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,960
three months later. They found a 22% performance increase after allowing employees to choose where

216
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,240
they work. 22%. That's the equivalent of an extra work day just by giving people the choice of where

217
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,000
they want to work. That's amazing. All right. I've got a couple more studies I'm going to move

218
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,360
through a lot quicker. So in 2009, Cisco had a teleworker survey. So they let their employees

219
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,440
work from home for a year. This is what they found. They found a significant increase in

220
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,840
productivity, work-life flexibility, and job satisfaction. This is fantastic for employees.

221
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,360
They found a $277 million savings in productivity. It's fantastic for the company.

222
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:13,600
And they found 47,320 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions were not released in one year

223
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,040
due to teleworking. That's fantastic for the environment. If you're not commuting every day,

224
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:25,200
you're drastically reducing your carbon footprint. All right. So one more study for you about

225
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,240
advocating for remote work. So some researchers got together and they did a literature review.

226
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,960
And they said, let's take a look at all of the remote work studies and let's see what we find.

227
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:43,520
So they looked at 46 studies spanning 20 years. And I know you're not supposed to read the slides,

228
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,680
but I'm going to because I love what they wrote in their paper. So here we go. Telecommuting has a

229
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:56,000
clear upside. Small but favorable effects on perceived autonomy, work-family conflict,

230
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:02,880
job satisfaction, performance, turnover intent. That's the attrition rate we've been talking about,

231
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:10,720
and stress. Contrary to expectations in both academic and practitioner literatures, telecommuting

232
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,840
also has no straightforward damaging effects on the quality of workplace relationships or

233
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,360
perceived career prospects. So this is amazing, right? This is what we've been talking about. So

234
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,520
they found that it's great for the employee, right? It's great for job satisfaction. It's great for

235
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,040
the company, right? You're not, you're reducing turnover intent. And then what I love at the end

236
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:37,040
is they said, you know what, contrary to what we thought, we didn't actually find issues with career

237
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,480
prospects. So we kind of saw that in that first call center study, but when they examined the

238
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,760
research over 20 years, they didn't find that to be a problem, which is awesome. Now, some of you

239
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,320
are probably thinking, okay, she advocates for remote work. She's only showing us the good stuff.

240
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,360
Okay. So I'm going to show you some of the downsides to working remotely according to the research.

241
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,720
So the first one, professional isolation negatively impacts job performance. Yeah, that's true,

242
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,240
right? But that's the case whether you're remote or in the office. You need to make sure that you're

243
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,680
not professionally isolated. You've got to very proactively communicate with your peers,

244
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:21,120
communicate with those who are above and below you so you can do your job well. Another study said,

245
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,960
maybe it doesn't matter where I work. Maybe it matters where my manager works. And so they found

246
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,840
that having a remote manager can actually negatively impact you. And I think this is kind of related,

247
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,760
right? So if your manager is professionally isolated, it's going to impact you as well.

248
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,640
So you need to make sure that your manager is very tuned into what's going on and is going to advocate

249
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:48,160
for you. All right, third one, remote employees fear stalling careers, isolation, distractions,

250
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,360
and blurred lines between work and home life. That's true. These are things that I used to fear.

251
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:59,840
But my experience after eight years of being a remote employee, almost nine, is that you can

252
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,520
actively work to combat these. These are not things I still fear. These are things that I

253
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,880
work on and my career has kept going. And finally, this one is a little surprising to people.

254
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,080
Remote work encourages employees to overwork and to allow their work to infringe on their family

255
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,520
role. So a lot of people think, okay, if you're working from home, you're slacking. That's actually

256
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,800
not the case. Work from home employees are often very paranoid that that's going to be the impression.

257
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,280
So we show up every time. We've got our stuff together. If we're at a scrum, we're talking

258
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:37,200
about what we're doing. We're making sure that we are getting our part done. It's also very easy to

259
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,320
overwork. If your day is wrapping up and you've got a bug, you're like, oh, I'll just sit here and

260
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,280
figure this out. And three hours later, you're still working. Or if your partner goes out for

261
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,040
the night, you're like, well, I'm a little behind on work. And then you spend an extra five hours

262
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,120
working. So remote employees have to really actively prevent burnout.

263
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,080
All right. So where are we here? We've been talking about the question, does remote work really work?

264
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,880
Yes. Our studies all show remote work works for the employee. It's great for productivity. It's

265
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,240
great for job satisfaction. It works for the company. Productivity leads to more profit.

266
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,240
And it's great for the environment. If you're not commuting every day, you are drastically

267
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,000
reducing your carbon footprint. Okay. So hopefully I've convinced you, right? I've convinced you that

268
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,880
remote work is awesome. And some of you are going, okay, but now I've got to convince my boss. Okay.

269
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,320
How are we going to do that? How are we going to convince your boss to let you work remotely?

270
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,880
So there's a great book called Remote Office Not Required. And what they suggest is to propose

271
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,080
an experiment. Go to your boss. Explain your reasons for why you want to work remotely.

272
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,880
Maybe it's something really serious, like your mother-in-law just moved in and she's aging and

273
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,400
you need to be there to take care of her. Or maybe it's something lighter, something fun,

274
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,520
like you want to be able to travel the world. Be honest. Explain why you want to work remotely.

275
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,800
And propose an experiment. So maybe for the next three months, you're going to work from home full

276
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,880
time. Or maybe you're going to work from home two days a week. Or maybe you're going to work

277
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,200
from home just in the afternoons. But talk about what you think the experiment should be.

278
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,960
And then talk about how you're going to evaluate the results, right? Because you need to know

279
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,040
definitively yes or no, this experiment passed or failed. And then propose the experiment for all

280
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,600
team members. So you've got fairness going on, right? You want to be the kid who's working

281
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,320
remotely when everybody else is stuck in the office. So some managers will be like, yeah,

282
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,360
that's cool. No problem. That's very reasonable. You're being very level-headed. Got it. Okay.

283
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,240
But some managers are going to be like, what about collaboration? What about water cooler

284
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,240
conversations? How are you going to replicate that? Well, some people replicate it with tools

285
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,160
like Slack. My company, we've got an actual water cooler channel in Slack. And you'll see people,

286
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,280
even if they're sitting right next to each other at their desk, will sit there and type in the

287
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:03,360
water cooler channel, right? So you can kind of recreate that online. But for many people,

288
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,800
the idea that you can be as collaborative or as innovative remotely is a really hard sell.

289
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,920
They don't care about the data. They don't care about the productivity. It's this gut feeling

290
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,720
they have that it's just not going to work. So I love, again, I'm going to reference that same

291
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:26,560
book, Remote Office Not Required. And they ask you to stop and think, how many wildly innovative

292
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:32,960
ideas can your team process and implement at a time? Like, really think about it. How many

293
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:40,320
things can you implement? Maybe two? Maybe three? So suggest that everyone gets together every few

294
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,440
months, maybe once a quarter. Be wildly innovative. Get everybody together. Have those ideas.

295
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,680
And then disperse to your remote location so you can get stuff done, right? Because we saw you're

296
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:56,400
going to get a productivity increase when you allow people to work remotely. When all else fails,

297
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,280
talk about the bottom line. Talk about how you can save the company money on office space.

298
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,520
Talk about how the company will be able to hire top talent from anywhere in the world without

299
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,880
paying relocation costs. Talk about how you can reduce attrition rates. Don't do it in a

300
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,360
threatening way, like you're going to quit your job because nobody likes that. But talk about the

301
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,160
reduced attrition rates. And then finally, talk about the productivity increases that's going to

302
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:27,920
lead to more profit. All right. So I've convinced you. You've convinced your boss. Now you need to

303
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,920
be successful. How are you actually going to succeed at working remotely, right? Because you

304
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:37,360
don't want to fail like this guy. You don't want that to be you. You want to be the pop star of

305
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:45,120
remote work, right? Okay. So I've got five tips for you. Number five, join the right team. I highly

306
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,400
recommend that you join a fully distributed team if possible. Okay. Why? All right. So imagine the

307
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,640
scenario. So somebody gets stuck on a problem. They're sitting at their desk and they can't

308
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,560
figure out why, what's going on. They're struggling to debug. So they walk over to their teammate.

309
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,440
And they're talking and they're having a conversation. They say, oh, you know what? I

310
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,760
think Sally just solved that problem last week. Let's talk about it. So they get Sally together

311
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,000
and then they go to a whiteboard and they sketch it out. They solve the problem. Everybody goes

312
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,640
back to their desk and implements it. They might totally forget to tell you that that conversation

313
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,240
happened. My experience has been that distributed teams are much more conscious of that happening.

314
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,040
First, they schedule times to meet and they'll bring everybody in. And then if they forget,

315
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,760
if it's truly as a one-off conversation, they'll let the team know. So distributed teams, fully

316
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,440
distributed teams are so much easier to work with. Also, consider the communication styles.

317
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,800
A lot of teams now are using video chat, so it's a lot easier to see people's faces. But when you're

318
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,920
a remote employee, you have to be very vocal. You have to be comfortable saying how you're feeling,

319
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,440
saying when you're struggling, saying when you disagree, because people aren't going to be able

320
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,760
to read it on your face. So consider the communication styles of the team and you'll

321
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,720
be comfortable working with those personalities. And finally, this can feel a little awkward,

322
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,960
but when you find the right team, I highly recommend that you schedule one-on-ones with

323
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,080
each team member. I had a mentor suggest this to me years ago and it felt so awkward at first,

324
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,720
but it totally works. Schedule 15-minute one-on-ones. Get on the phone and say, hey,

325
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,040
you know, my name is Lauren, this is my role, here's why I'm excited to be on the team,

326
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:28,080
here's a little bit of my work history. And then ask them to do the same. Then share a picture of

327
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,120
yourself, maybe with your family, maybe doing one of your hobbies, maybe on vacation. And chances

328
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,880
are, you don't have to ask, chances are they'll send a picture back. And in that moment, you've

329
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,080
broken the barrier, right? Things are more personal. It's so much easier to go ask them for help

330
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,240
and for them to communicate with you, right? Because you're becoming a real person. All right,

331
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,400
so number five, join the right team, make sure it's distributed, make sure you're comfortable

332
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:57,040
talking with these people. Number four, be productive, do your job. Okay, that's obvious,

333
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:02,560
right? Okay, how are you going to do that? Every day, I highly recommend that you set daily goals.

334
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,400
You know, every day I will look at my to-do list and I'll say, what are the top two or three things

335
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,120
that I need to get done today? I don't have anybody else holding me accountable, I have to

336
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,080
hold myself accountable. So this helps me stay on task and make sure that I'm not putting off those

337
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:24,720
hard or daunting tasks, but I really am focusing on what's most important. Also, create a workspace

338
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,760
you love. This is my office from a couple years ago, it looks a little dark on the screen, but

339
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,240
I love this office because it has lots of pink, it has lots of sunlight, I could play my music,

340
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,880
it made me happy when I went in there. So create a workspace that you're going to love working in.

341
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,520
Don't work on your couch, right? Be ergonomically correct, you know, adjust your keyboard tray,

342
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,360
that sort of thing, but create a workspace that's going to allow you to be productive.

343
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:54,480
Number three, communicate with your team. So first thing is you have to be present. Be present

344
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,600
when you say you are. Different teams communicate in different ways, so make sure that you're aware

345
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,640
of what's important to your team. Some teams are very slack heavy, some teams are very email heavy.

346
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,240
Make sure that when people are communicating with you, you're responding back promptly to them

347
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,880
in that same medium. Get personal, you know, we talked about having those one-on-ones. Most of

348
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,800
the time, talk to your coworkers about your job, right? You want them to know you're on task, but

349
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,800
every once in a while, ask how they're doing, ask how their kids are, ask how their vacation was.

350
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:29,280
Make sure you're keeping things personal just like you would in an office. Last thing I'll say on

351
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:35,520
this, I attended the Grace Hopper celebration of women in computing years ago, and Nora Denzel

352
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,520
gave a fabulous keynote, I've got a link in the back of my slides, and one of her points was to

353
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,200
be a great PR agent for yourself. Be very careful of the words you use to describe yourself.

354
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,000
This is so important in the office, but I think it's even more important when you're a remote

355
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,360
employee. Be very conscious of the words you're using. If something is hard, tell people that

356
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,480
it's hard and that you solved it, right? Brag about your work, talk about it in a very positive way.

357
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,200
Don't say, oh, I've been stuck on this problem for three days, right? Be very conscious of how

358
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,720
you are projecting yourself. People only know about you what you tell them, so be a great PR

359
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:21,040
agent for yourself. Number two, travel. Most of you have done this to get here today, so you're

360
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:27,760
already doing it. Good job. Right? So travel. Get out of your home office. I highly recommend if you

361
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,400
get a chance to go meet a coworker, do it. Get that FaceTime. I worked at a company previously

362
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,480
that it was very hard, you couldn't get travel approved to just go meet your teammates. Like,

363
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,960
I have managers that I've never met in person, which is crazy. So sometimes you have to hack

364
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:50,640
the system. So maybe you and your teammate arrange a client visit. Maybe you both submit a conference

365
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,600
proposal so that you can go speak together. But whenever you get a chance, go meet your teammates

366
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,280
in person, because once you've got that relationship, it's so much easier to talk online.

367
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:09,120
All right. Last tip, my number one tip for remote employees to be successful. Actively prevent

368
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:15,280
burnout. So we talked about that's a big downside of remote work is you actually overwork, right?

369
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,280
So how are you going to prevent burnout? Because your company wants you to be successful, right?

370
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,240
They've spent all this money training you, getting you up to the point of being productive. They

371
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,560
don't want to lose you. So there are a couple different ways. First, take a lunch break.

372
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,520
My husband's always like, why don't you just skip your lunch break and you could be done

373
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,760
30 minutes earlier? I'm like, the lunch break is huge. It's so important. You know, I like to go

374
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,960
sit and watch TV and eat lunch, but some people like to go out for a walk or read a book. So do

375
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,520
something away from your desk. When you're in the office, you get natural breaks. People will come

376
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,520
up and talk to you, but you have to take breaks intentionally when you're a remote employee.

377
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,680
Stretch before meetings. Okay, this one sounds a little crazy, but for some reason, office

378
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,800
employees never show up to meetings on time. So you get a chance if you show up two minutes early

379
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,520
that you can go walk around your house or you can turn off your camera and stretch for a minute.

380
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,320
But take a minute, clear your head, right? As a remote employee, you don't have to do anything.

381
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,800
You just log in. You can keep sitting. So take a break before your meeting. Make sure you're

382
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,960
focused and you're ready. Last thing on this I'll say is turn off your computer after work.

383
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,840
So examine yourself and say, what are my typical work hours? You know, what am I comfortable

384
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:31,040
working on a regular day? And stick to that schedule. Things come up and that's totally fine,

385
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,360
right? You can have exceptions, but for the most part, when your workday is done, turn off your

386
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:40,560
computer. And that includes turning off your notifications on your phone for things like Slack

387
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,360
and email or whatever. And then you can go to work. You can go to work. You can go to work.

388
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,600
And email or whatever tools your team uses. But you've got to take a step away because it's so

389
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:58,160
easy to burn out. So seriously turn off your computer. All right. So for those of you who

390
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,160
like to take pictures of slides, I made this for you. So let's recap. The top five tips for making

391
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,680
remote work really work. Number five, select the right team, right? Make sure it's distributed.

392
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,280
Make sure you're comfortable raising issues with these people. Number four, be productive.

393
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,600
Do your job, but make sure you've got a workspace that you actually think you'll be productive in.

394
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,280
Number three, communicate with your team. Be present when you say you are. Get back to people

395
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,920
quickly. Number two, travel. You're doing it. And number one, actively prevent burnout. Turn

396
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:38,400
off your computer. All right. So let's wrap this up. Today we've been asking the question,

397
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:45,120
does remote work really work? Working remotely can be the worst, right? You can fail so hard

398
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:55,360
that people will animate your failure. But working remotely can be the best. You can be the pop star

399
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:02,880
of remote work. So yes, the studies, surveys, and anecdotal evidence all show that remote work

400
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,640
really works. I'm not saying that remote work is for everyone. It's not. But it is a fantastic

401
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:15,040
option for some. Remote work works for the employee. It works for the company. And it works

402
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:21,120
for the environment. I want to leave you with one final quote. At the Grace Hopper celebration of

403
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:26,800
women in computing, Tela Whitney was asked during a keynote panel what she would change if she could

404
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:34,480
change one thing. Her response was simple. If I could change anything, it would be that each and

405
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:41,040
every one of you would ask for what she wants. And that's my wish for you today. Whether what you want

406
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:47,440
is to work a more flexible schedule, to change your role, to take on more responsibility, or to work

407
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:56,000
remotely, I hope that each of you will ask for what you want. So yes, remote work really works. So I

408
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,240
encourage you, please advocate for the remote work option. Advocate for yourself. And advocate for

409
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,760
others who want to advance their careers but are not able to physically be present in the office.

410
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:25,600
Thank you. So quick housekeeping thing. I know I tricked my AV guy. You can get the slides on my

411
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:31,840
Twitter page. They're currently pinned to the top of my page. I'm Lauren. At the end of the deck,

412
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,400
you'll find an appendix with links to all of the studies I referenced today as well as a bunch of

413
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,200
other studies I didn't have time to get into. And then that Nora Denzel keynote speech that seriously

414
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:47,280
you should watch. Also, I think I'm out of time for questions. So I will be at the MongoDB booth

415
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,600
immediately after this talk until the booth closes, which I think is at 5 p.m. today. So come, I'd love

416
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,440
to talk to you about remote work. I'd love to talk to you about MongoDB. So please come find me.

417
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:04,240
And finally, we've got an ask me anything with the MongoDB Python team at 5 p.m. in room 21. They
