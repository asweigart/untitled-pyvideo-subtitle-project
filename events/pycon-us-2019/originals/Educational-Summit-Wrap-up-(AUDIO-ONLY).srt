1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
Yes, thank you. Okay. So this is the wrap-up session for the mini sprints. We had, I think,

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,000
like, one, two, three, four, like, seven different clusters of people working on stuff. I'm going

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,960
to report out first because I was in one as well. And then we have a line of people who

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,520
are going to do one to two-minute report outs of what we did in our cluster. So in my cluster,

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:31,080
we had two mini sprints. One was mine on making worksheets around Python syntax and other

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,240
sort of drill education things that we need from a language standpoint. And then we also

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:43,320
had Mason Eggers. Did I get that right? I hope I did. Cool. Got a thumbs up. Can you

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:52,320
yell the name of your website? Unlockededu. Unlocked.edu, in fact. Unlockededu.edu. And

9
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,360
unlockededu.org is the correct version of there, where you're trying to compile up multiple

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,120
choice questions into a website where you can access them and compile them together with

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,080
an API. And so we all worked together to try and create questions. And we had a great time

12
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,680
kind of coming up with a format that would work for these worksheets and brainstorming

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,240
a lot of what should be inside of these workshops and worksheets and questions and trying to

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,000
come up with what are the concept model of misconceptions that can happen in things like

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,400
functions and for loops and using that to drive some of the content. And we have repos

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,520
going, or at least I do for my project. We have repos and style guide and license and

17
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,600
contributor guide and a couple completed worksheets at this point. And templates worked out. So

18
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,600
I'm really excited. All right. Name and one to two minutes.

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm Dylan. And the thing I was working on was DocTest quizzes, which is essentially

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,480
we're allowing students to take quizzes using the DocTest module, which is a standard library

21
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:08,760
in Python. We, our project changed a lot in the last VRs. Initially, it was going to be

22
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:14,160
a web app. And now we're going to be integrating, probably going to be integrating Jupyter Notebooks

23
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:25,160
as a plugin to Canvas, which is a learning management system. And I'll let you do the rest of it.

24
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:34,680
I'm Adrian. What we did was we worked on kind of creating questions for the Python certification

25
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,680
that Jeff talked about and that like the MTA 98 whatever, 81 or I don't remember, but

26
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:51,040
93 or whatever. But anyway, that Python certification that people found very challenging, very difficult,

27
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,880
like it was long and just like tedious. So we started creating questions. We have Sphinx

28
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:03,880
running RuneStone so that we can just run RuneStone build and have those questions out

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,160
and just rewrite the questions and then we can just check the questions. So yeah, that's

30
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,160
what we did.

31
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,960
My name is Alex. I was working with the SensorCraft group over there, like the Minecraft game.

32
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,380
One of the biggest things we worked on was we thought about making an installer. One

33
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,280
of these things we thought of was a mutex editor implementation to make it a lot easier

34
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,760
because some of the people even in that group had a hard time downloading it and getting

35
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,840
everything working. And so we can't really expect kids to do that then. So making it

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,360
easier for kids to download. We also encountered a retina screen issue with Mac OS that the

37
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,400
game would display at a quarter of its actual size, which obviously won't work. And so we

38
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,400
got that fixed. We also learned about PyGame Zero, which is like a Python-based game creator

39
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:58,520
that lets you create really robust code to create games. And we thought about that and

40
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,680
took some examples and thought of how we could apply that to SensorCraft because we have

41
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,880
about 900 lines, but we're trying to condense that as much as we can, again, so it makes

42
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,600
sense for younger kids.

43
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,480
We also talked about Blocky, maybe making some way that there's like an introduction

44
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,400
that teaches you with Block-based programming and then you kind of transform into text-based

45
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,140
programming. Again, even younger kids can understand it and they kind of have a less

46
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,240
steep learning curve. We also talked about explicitly defining prerequisites. So we used

47
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,480
some big words like algorithm mapping, that type of stuff. So just going through and making

48
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,920
sure that the kids actually understand what we're talking about and they're not just

49
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,320
going to lost and sit quietly in the back of the classroom and not raise their hand

50
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,160
because they don't want to look stupid. So we went there and defined some of those things

51
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,200
that we assumed that the kids would know.

52
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,420
And finally, we also talked a lot about integrating into a school setting. So we had some teachers

53
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,240
in our group that really wanted to use this in their classroom, but they have to use Common

54
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,000
Core. And so we went through each tutorial and thought about what Common Core standard

55
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,760
would this be hitting? What programming activity would this be teaching the students? And kind

56
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,280
of made it a lot easier to integrate into a school curriculum, whereas before there

57
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,280
wasn't explicit lessons for each tutorial. But thank you.

58
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,760
Hi I'm Gabrielle and I led a mini sprint on creating Jupyter notebooks to help high school

59
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,600
students analyze scientific data sets. So we had a great group of sprinters. We had

60
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,560
mathematicians, physicists, biologists, grad students, professors, coders, so a great group.

61
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,080
And we split into three subgroups to work on three different notebooks. One on a coral

62
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,680
reef data set, one on an earthquakes data set, and one on a very difficult to work with

63
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,280
plant archeology data set. So thank you for dealing with that one. And there are now three

64
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,440
new Jupyter notebooks in a GitHub repository that are open source. Anyone can feel free

65
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,320
to use them. I tweeted out the repository if you're interested in it, just let me know.

66
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,080
And there are still works in progress, but they all have a lot of great examples of exploring

67
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,180
a data set, getting some questions you can ask about them, making data visualizations.

68
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,180
So I'm really proud of what we came up with and look forward to seeing where it goes.

69
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:17,180
Hi I'm Shlomi. In my group we work about developing learning activities for teaching programming

70
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,720
problem solving. Think about the challenge students have after getting syntax and basic

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,680
of the language, how I take problem and solve it end to end. So basically we are using a

72
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,840
Jupyter notebook that starts with a problem and guides the students through solving the

73
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,400
problem, like getting what is the problem, making design, code, testing, and debugging

74
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,200
and reflecting about its work. Writing a work through is really tough because you need to

75
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:51,200
really design well the path you want the student will go through that. So we took one advent

76
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,800
of code problem and make a design and make a break it into an outline, what is the path

77
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:02,520
we want the student to go. It's include for example reasoning explicitly about a data structure

78
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,960
you want to use. It also includes strategies like simplification. I don't know how to solve

79
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,160
the original problem, so I'll try to solve a simplified one. So we make all of that explicit

80
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,240
and embedded with activities in the middle for the students. And I'm very happy and

81
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,240
think it was very successful. Hi, my name is Ariel. I was leading a sprint, many sprint

82
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,680
on pair programming, effective pair programming with students. So we spent most of the time

83
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:42,080
actually working on pairs so that we could have experience first hand. There were five

84
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,880
people in the group and well I decided to team with one of the other person so that

85
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:53,000
we could actually have three teams in total. So we spent most of the time solving a group

86
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,080
of problems that I originally proposed. Some issues happened on using the tool that we

87
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:06,080
were basically utilizing. We were using an online judge to solve certain problems and

88
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,200
getting a hang of the online judge was a little bit of an issue in itself. But at the end

89
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,160
every team actually solved at least a few problems. So they were able to have first

90
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:26,160
hand experience on actually working with somebody else doing the corresponding roles in pair

91
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,940
programming which is the driver and the navigator. So at four o'clock we stopped and we had the

92
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:38,240
opportunity to fill in a survey, an online survey so that we could actually have quantified

93
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,160
the experience. And then we had a small discussion on the personal experience that we had using

94
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,440
pair programming. We can see that there are still a lot of questions that we need to answer

95
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,440
but hopefully we should be able to have these issues solved or at least we'll explore them

96
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,200
a little bit in the coming months or the full year in the future. Thank you very much.

97
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Hi, I'm Ariadna and I was working with the Raspberry Pi group and I believe initially

98
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,800
we were trying to work on a template that would help educators kind of set up like more

99
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:32,040
of a simplified way to set up a Raspberry Pi like an introduction just like very basic

100
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:39,080
stuff and I think we decided on a template that is on DocuWiki that would allow educators

101
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,920
as well as developers to contribute but kind of bridge the gap so that educators aren't

102
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:55,920
overwhelmed with like the tech language but also be able to pull lessons and be able to

103
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,280
translate them for their students but without getting intimidated by not knowing how to

104
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:09,280
use GitHub. That kind of thing. I think that's pretty much it. Okay, thank you. Great, can

105
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:19,800
we get a round of applause for all of the Mini Sprint organizers and another round for

106
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,800
all of the participants as well providing awesome help. So yeah, this was an experiment

107
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,160
to run this year and I was really excited to get down to business and get some stuff

108
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,400
done. I think we got a lot of really cool stuff worked on and some new experiences and

109
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,560
you know, do you want to have some final comments and then we can all go and get prepared for

110
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,560
the lovely opening reception. Yes, so thank you everyone for attending and it is very

111
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,280
good. Something new this year has been pretty successful so we are quite happy about that.

112
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:02,280
We will now be sitting down and preparing for next year's summit. I would really appreciate

113
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,280
feedback. Please feel free to send it to PyCon Edu Summit, the email address that's on the

114
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:14,280
website and if anybody is wanting to volunteer or wants to know more about the programs or

115
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,880
the talks that were mentioned today, please feel free to reach out. Hope to see all of

116
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,360
you next year in 2020. Thank you.
