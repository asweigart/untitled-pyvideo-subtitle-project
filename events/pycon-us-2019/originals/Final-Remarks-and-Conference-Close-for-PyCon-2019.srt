1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
All right.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,740
So some things to catch up on.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,960
PyCon is like in its final moments.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,120
But it's not going to end.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,200
There are a few things you should know about.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,200
You may have signed up for them.

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,640
Or maybe you're going to learn about them and take part.

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:22,120
Tonight at 6.30 at the Great Lakes Science Center is the final closing dinner of PyCon.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,920
If you have a ticket, please attend.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,560
If you no longer want to use your ticket, get it to someone.

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,180
The food is already there.

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,060
And it will help reduce waste.

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,380
Shortly after this, my remarks will be the sprint announcements.

14
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,560
So we'll give the hall about 15 minutes to clear out.

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,600
And then Kushal will be up here to run sprint rows, as I like to call them.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,640
This is where people who are leading sprint projects can have a moment or two to come

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,380
up and introduce their project.

18
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,700
And those who are interested in sprinting can listen and choose what they'll be working

19
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,460
on or consider working on.

20
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,940
So if you are running a sprint and you want to make that announcement, stick around and

21
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,300
wait for Kushal's instructions.

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,900
At 5 p.m. and 25 c., you can attend an intro to sprinting workshop, which will give you

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,420
a basic overview of what sprints are and how they work.

24
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,180
The sprint days are Monday through Thursday.

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,420
And coffee and lunch will be provided.

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,140
So some announcements.

27
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,580
From the PyLadies auction last night, the results are in.

28
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,300
Fully tallied and prepared.

29
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:33,860
And just for some history, in 2016, 16,000, 21,000, 30,000 last year.

30
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:46,100
And this year raised $41,000 in benefit of the PyLadies.

31
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:54,460
In addition, the Python Software Foundation has agreed to round that up to a $45,000 number.

32
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:04,020
So it might be wise to start saving and considering what you might donate for next year's auction.

33
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,620
Because the number just has to keep going up.

34
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,420
Oh, and one more final announcement.

35
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,880
I'm really happy to share something that the Python Software Foundation has launched, which

36
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,900
is the all-new PyCon.org.

37
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,100
So this resource can help you find a PyCon closer to you and scratch that itch well before

38
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,820
the next installment of this event.

39
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,380
You can find it at PyCon.org.

40
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,100
Don't go to www.pycon.org because I didn't realize that GitHub pages wouldn't cover that

41
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,460
on TLS.

42
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:45,620
I think that's something I might be sprinting on starting tomorrow.

43
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,940
And for organizers, I'd really love for you to go to this URL if you're an organizer in

44
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,140
the room, share it with your other organizing friends.

45
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,420
This URL will take you to a repository where you can add your event to a CSV file.

46
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,300
Eventually that CSV file will power this site, all of the content on it.

47
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,700
And that will help make it more direct and easier for us to have a central location to

48
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,300
find all of these events.

49
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,620
There are more and more every year.

50
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:23,020
So now it's time for something that at no point was I sure I would be prepared for.

51
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,540
We're going to take it slow and we're going to get through it together.

52
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,540
All right?

53
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,620
So PyCon 2019, as most of us know it, has come to its very last moments.

54
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,780
It has been such a privilege to fill the role of chair for PyCon.

55
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,540
And I appreciate that each and every one of you are here.

56
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,260
Personally, it's been a transformative experience.

57
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:59,740
I'm eternally grateful for being trusted and supported in this work.

58
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:06,220
During my time as chair, people have regularly asked me, Ernest, what is PyCon?

59
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,020
Over time, my answer to this question became an almost robotic response.

60
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,420
It was just dates and event names and numbers in the same order over and over.

61
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,820
It began to feel hollow.

62
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:33,500
It didn't match what I feel every time I think about my experiences at PyCon in the past.

63
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,540
So my proclivity to tweet took over and I tweeted.

64
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,020
I asked you.

65
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,300
I asked that you share it so that others might answer.

66
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,540
And you answered.

67
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,260
The responses of the survey are not something that I can even consider reading to you, sharing

68
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,660
on screen, or honestly even spend too much time thinking about.

69
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,900
The results is always me in a puddle of my own tears, emotions spewing out of every corner

70
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,060
of my heart.

71
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:11,500
But I think, and think, I can stomach sharing the consistent theme in nearly every response.

72
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Applause

73
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:32,620
Spending this time in person with others in our community deepens, broadens, and often

74
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,820
creates the network of personal and professional relationships that underpin Python and the

75
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,780
Python community.

76
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,180
There's no correct way for how these interactions occur or what they look like.

77
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,340
And this is a factor in why PyCon has so many events and is so long.

78
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,740
And it's also a big reason why the Hatchery program is so important to me.

79
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,540
To support the evolution of PyCon over time, to support and grow our community.

80
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,540
I want to take a moment to recognize the privilege that we all share to be in this room and have

81
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:12,500
access to this subset of the community as it exists today, no matter how we got here.

82
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,120
The Python community is so much more than the 3200 people who have gathered here in

83
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,220
Cleveland over the past few days.

84
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:27,700
In the 2018 Python developer survey alone, 18,000 people from more than 150 countries

85
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,380
responded.

86
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,700
It's hard to say just how large our community truly is or how large it will grow, but we

87
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,420
can make some rough estimates in our head.

88
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:44,660
As there are no plans to substantially grow the size of PyCon, how do we ensure that others

89
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,940
have access to this community?

90
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:55,300
And this conference does not become bottleneck for the growth and sustaining our community.

91
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,680
As you return to your home, I'm nearly certain that there's a national or regional PyCon,

92
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,460
a meetup group or some other manifestation of our community nearby.

93
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,940
It may be smaller, but it represents the same opportunities to connect and grow.

94
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:17,220
You can find resources on this site, on these URLs, for conferences and events around the

95
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,980
world that are likely closer to you.

96
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:26,260
I want to encourage you to attend, support, and volunteer at these events.

97
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,380
Maybe even consider organizing one.

98
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,460
They help to provide access to the same kind of opportunities that we as a community can't

99
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,500
sustain on just once a year at this event.

100
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:46,300
Speaking of next year, I would like to now introduce to you the incoming chair of PyCon

101
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,300
for Pittsburgh in 2020 and 2021, Emily.

102
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,820
All right.

103
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:18,420
So the good news is that we're actually less than a year away from our next PyCon.

104
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,780
So our next two years will be in Pittsburgh on April 15th through the 23rd of 2020 and

105
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,060
May 12th through the 20th of 2021.

106
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,700
We hope to see all of you there again in the next years.

107
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,700
All right.

108
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,900
And now we want to take a moment to recognize all of the many, many people who come together

109
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,940
to make this event possible.

110
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,940
If you hear the name of a group that you helped participate in, please stand up and stay standing

111
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,060
so that you can be recognized.

112
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,780
We have quite the list, so I'm not going to pause for applause in between, but please

113
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,940
don't let that stop you from applauding from the very beginning.

114
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:09,260
Without further ado, we want to thank the PSF staff who are the bedrock of this conference.

115
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:19,220
Our diversity and outreach chairs, our publicity chair and blog team, our accessibility chair,

116
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:27,100
our program committee chairs and reviewers, our volunteer incident responders, our tutorials

117
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:34,580
chairs, our posters chairs, all of the people who ran the lightning talks, our financial

118
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:42,220
aid team, our session staff chairs and green room staff, our sprint coordinators, our open

119
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:49,820
spaces team, the PyCon hatchery committee, the PyCon charlis team, the art of Python

120
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:57,180
organizers, the maintainers summit organizers, the mentored sprints organizers, the Pylates

121
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:04,060
charity auction coordinators and volunteers, the education summit chair and team, the language

122
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:12,140
summit coordinators, our startup row facilitators, our captioning coordinator and captioning

123
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:19,900
staff, to the tech, audio and video staff, to the young coders educators, the 5K run

124
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:28,860
and walk coordinators, our mobile guide coordinators and our swag bag head, Paul Hillbrant.

125
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,900
We want to thank all of our speakers, our tutorial instructors, our poster presenters,

126
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:40,500
our education summit speakers, our charlis speakers and to all of the people who volunteered

127
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,820
on site to help stuff and distribute swag bags, who helped with young coders, who staffed

128
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:53,060
the green room, ran for speakers, chaired sessions, ran items at the auction, worked

129
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,060
the registration booth and greeted for tutorials.

130
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:27,180
And I want to give one final thank you before we disperse and that is to all of you because

131
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,540
without all of you our community would not be possible.

132
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,660
So thank you and we'll see you in Pittsburgh 2020.
