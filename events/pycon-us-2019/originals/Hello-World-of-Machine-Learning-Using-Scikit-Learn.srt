1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,320
So, good morning, everyone. We'll be starting now. So, we need Anaconda Navigator and the

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,120
Jupyter Notebooks for this particular tutorial. And this is the survey link. I will show this

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:33,000
again at the end of tutorial. And there are some announcements from PyCon. So, the first break

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,760
will happen at 10.15. It is mentioned that snacks go quickly. So, if you haven't had a break fast,

5
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:48,240
then decide accordingly. Lunch will be at 12.20 to 1.20. Food trucks will be at the grassy area

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:58,960
of the East Mall Drive. And please share the power sockets. Okay. Okay. So, this tutorial is

7
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,160
Hello, World of Machine Learning Using Scikit-learn. Here is the expectations from this tutorial. This

8
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,960
will not make you an expert in machine learning, but it will cover enough things to acquaint,

9
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,320
enable, and empower you to understand, explore, and exploit the concepts and idea behind it.

10
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,560
Might be feeling that it's too much of a material, but these are the basic steps that are needed for

11
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,040
you to start your journey with machine learning. If you are absolute beginner, fine, you will be

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,960
at home. If you know some things about machine learning, still you will learn something new.

13
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:42,800
Okay. So, let me introduce myself. My name is Deepak K. Gupta. Also known by my pet name,

14
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:49,200
which is Dutch. I'm programming pretty much since the time I was a teenager. I got my first full-time

15
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,760
software development job in the year 2000. Still doing that. And I've, over the last 20 years,

16
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:02,640
I've worked with many programming languages and many domains. Just a recommendation that if you

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:10,600
know only one or two programming languages, try to explore two, three more. It just helps. I'm also

18
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,320
a technical content creator. I write blogs on Medium and create YouTube videos. And if you want

19
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,120
to reach me on Twitter, this is me. And this is the place where I put all my technical contents.

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay. Here is the agenda for this tutorial. We'll be exploring some of the acronyms. Then,

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,880
we will talk about machine learning algorithms. We'll introduce to scikit-learn. Then, we will

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,120
learn some prerequisites of machine learning using scikit-learn. Some things like NumPy and

23
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,960
Matplotlib. We'll also see Hello World dataset from scikit-learn for machine learning. Then,

24
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,000
we will explore supervised learning and unsupervised learning algorithms. So,

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,400
I'll be explaining at least three algorithms. That is linear regression, KNN, and K-mean clustering.

26
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:08,600
After doing all those things, we'll be also exploring how to explore real-world machine

27
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,200
learning data using pandas. Then, we will take one real-world example and apply the

28
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,840
machine learning algorithm on that. We will finish with a mapping application exercise.

29
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:32,760
Okay. So, let's start. So, what is AI, ML, and DL? These are the terms being used interchangeably.

30
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,920
AI means artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence means any decision that is being

31
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,680
taken without the direct intervention of a human being. Okay. So, if someone else which is not

32
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,400
perceived as intelligent like our laptops, if it is taking some decision without asking me,

33
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:00,720
it's called as artificial intelligence. If I display artificial intelligence as a big oval,

34
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,440
where does machine learning come into this? So, machine learning is part of artificial

35
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:13,000
intelligence. Artificial intelligence is built on top of machine learning. There is another

36
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,560
thing called DL which expands to deep learning. DL is considered as part of machine learning.

37
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,080
Now, this is this picture, AI, ML, and DL. As of now, it's the most acceptable picture across

38
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:37,240
the board about DL, ML, AI, and the relationship between these three. But in reality, you know,

39
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,760
these fields are still evolving. DL and ML are more overlapping in nature as compared to being

40
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,160
part of each other. But again, this is the most acceptable picture. And if you are going for a job

41
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,040
interview, this picture will help you at this point of time. Now, we will explore what is machine

42
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,840
learning. We will not look into deep learning, but let me tell you what is deep learning. So,

43
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,760
machine learning, what happens that we tell machine that, okay, you learn something about

44
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:10,720
some aspects of data and tell me the result. What deep learning does is that it's a combination

45
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,400
of machine learning. So, machine learning, you give some data to machine learning algorithm,

46
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,840
it gives some output. That output is again used for learning, which gives another output,

47
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,520
and that output is again used for learning. So, this is a chain of sequence that builds up. So,

48
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:34,240
then it is called deep learning. So, it's learning, result, learning from result, then learning from

49
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:41,400
result, and it goes on and on. It's clear, right? What is AI, ML, and DL? It's just a basic

50
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,480
introduction to what it means. Any question? So, at any point of time you have any question,

51
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:57,280
just raise your hand, I'll try to answer that. Okay. Okay. So, let's talk about the need for

52
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:06,120
machine learning, why machine learning is there. So, machine learning feeds on data. There can't

53
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,880
be anything called machine learning or data science without the availability of data. Data

54
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,080
is fuel for machine learning. Okay. So, if someone asks to define machine learning in

55
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,040
simple terms, here is how we can do that. So, machine learning is all about extracting valuable

56
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,000
information from the known data so that it can take appropriate decisions for the unknown ones.

57
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,160
So, if I have some data, I take valuable information out of it, okay, so that I can take some decisions

58
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:44,480
based on those data for the unknown ones. And in today's world, some of the problems can't be

59
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:53,080
solved without the help of machine learning. Okay. We will see some of them. Now, before I go ahead,

60
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,720
I want to explain one thing that what is similarity or difference between mathematics and machine

61
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:07,800
learning. You can come here, please. Now, all of you know that machine learning is based on

62
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,360
mathematics, right? You see lots and lots of calculus-related things when you talk about

63
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,040
machine learning. But what is the difference between mathematics and machine learning? Why

64
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:24,400
don't we use mathematics in its pure form and why do we use machine learning? Let's take an example.

65
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,960
Let's assume that airport is around 10 miles from this place and it will take you 20 minutes to

66
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:39,240
reach there. Just an assumption, okay? And if I ask a question, okay, it takes me 20 minutes to

67
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,640
reach airport, which is 10 miles. How much time I will take to reach the fifth mile? What will be

68
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:56,760
the answer? 10 minutes, right? Okay. So this is mathematics. Mathematics tells you that, you know

69
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:04,040
what, if you are taking 20 minutes to reach 10 miles, you will take 10 minutes to reach fifth mile.

70
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:10,880
But what machine learning does is that it tells, okay, hold on, you will reach to the airport in 20

71
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,720
minutes, but you are starting from downtown. There are lots and lots of traffic over here. There will

72
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,800
be traffic lights. You will start at different point of time. So you will reach the fifth mile

73
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,920
on 14th minute and you will cover rest of the distance in six minutes. This is what machine

74
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:33,720
learning is. Understand the difference between mathematics and machine learning? It's clear, okay?

75
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:46,480
So let's talk about a scenario to understand why machine learning is required. Let's assume that

76
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,160
some of you come up with a great startup idea, which is about building an e-commerce startup,

77
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,120
and you intend to sell consumer electronics, okay? Now once people come to your website and

78
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,240
buy something, you want to recommend also that you can buy this also, something like Amazon, okay?

79
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,240
All of us use Amazon, so we know that it recommends us something when we buy anything. Now in the

80
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,520
beginning, you analyze some data and come to a conclusion that you basically have two types

81
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:23,760
of customers. One is younger ones, less than 25 years of age, and rest of the people greater

82
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:33,040
than 25 years of age. Younger ones prefer iPhone and not so younger ones prefer laptops, okay?

83
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,800
So you decided that, okay, you know what, I'll go ahead and code that if the person which is

84
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,320
currently browsing on my website and the person is less than or equal to 25, I'll recommend iPhone.

85
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Otherwise, I'll recommend laptop. Good, and you are doing fine. But after some time,

86
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,560
you analyze some more data and you come to a conclusion that, oh, you know what,

87
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,600
I have another category called greater than 35 years of age, and they are the people who don't

88
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,280
like to spend money just like that, okay? So I will come up with a new category and say that,

89
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,320
you know what, if the people is 35 or more, I'll recommend budget option, budget laptops.

90
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,920
And now your startup is doing fine and you want to expand to another country,

91
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,600
and you decide to expand to a country like India, for example. But what happens that

92
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,160
in India, people like Android phones more than iPhones. What will you do? You say, no problem.

93
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,480
What I will do is that in younger generation, I'll create another category called North American

94
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,920
Market or India Market. In North American Market, I'll recommend iPhone. In India Market,

95
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,800
I'll recommend Android, as simple as that. So far, so good. You launched your startup in India.

96
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,600
It's working fine. But now you get some more data, and you came to a conclusion that, okay,

97
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,240
hold on a minute. India has lots and lots of middle class population. It's as good as

98
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,440
overall population of United States. So it doesn't mean that they are not buying iPhone.

99
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,120
They are also buying iPhone. And you come to a calculation that, okay, out of 10 phones

100
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,360
that are being sold there, 7 is Android, 3 is iPhone. It's not a real data. I just make it up,

101
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,560
okay. So what you will do is that, okay, you'll come up with another condition saying that, okay,

102
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,960
in India Market, what I will do is that I'll generate a random number. And 3 out of 10 times,

103
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,640
and 3 out of 10 times, I'll recommend iPhone. 7 out of 10 times, I'll recommend Android.

104
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:47,440
I'll stop here. But just wanted to check. Do you see the problem in this particular scenario?

105
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:58,720
Correct. So, you know, if you go ahead on and on and on and on, the permutation and combination

106
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:06,560
of conditions will be huge to manage, right? And other thing is that, you know what, if you

107
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,040
decide to write some code with these conditions, by the time you pass your emperors sitting in

108
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,440
quality control department or somewhere else and your bills are passed, your product is actually

109
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,680
shipped, and by the time it is actually coming to the market, this might be changed. The condition

110
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,240
might have changed because a new phone is being launched and people are quite enthusiastic about

111
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:38,480
it, so on and so forth. So these kind of problems can't be solved with static programming. And these

112
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:47,680
are the problems where we should use machine learning. So machine learning is not an answer

113
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,400
to all set of problems, but it is an answer to these kind of problems, where you have lots and

114
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:02,720
lots of conditions and things are very dynamic in nature. It's clear till now? Yes, okay. Are

115
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:12,160
you getting the point? So let's take a brief on machine learning algorithms and then we'll move

116
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:21,840
further. Okay, so machine learning algorithms are generally categorized into three types.

117
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,160
Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Let's talk about supervised learning.

118
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,600
So in a nutshell, supervised learning is very similar to what we want our kids to learn when

119
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:41,680
we send them to school. Okay, for example, we tell them, okay, this is history, this is geography,

120
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,040
this is friendly country, this is enemy country, and many other things, right? We know the result.

121
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,880
We want them to learn the result the way we want. This is called supervised learning,

122
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,200
where we say that, okay, this is the result. If this is this, then this is the result. You learn

123
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,960
this. That's all. You don't apply your mind. I am telling you, this means this. You just learn it.

124
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,600
So supervised learning is actually of two types. One is called classification. Classification is

125
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,880
easy. I mean, you can classify things into one of the available categories. For example, all of us

126
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,800
over here can be categorized into one of the 195 countries. There cannot be 196,

127
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:32,560
unless a country is created tomorrow. And regression is all about coming up with a continuous data.

128
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,400
So it's beyond classification, but what it does is that it gives you a continuous set of data. We

129
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:45,840
will see one example of it. Now, unsupervised learning is all about giving data to machine

130
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:52,960
learning algorithms and don't tell them the results. So it is just like I gave you the data,

131
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:59,680
you find out what it is. So let's take an example that if I give a high school data to unsupervised

132
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:07,600
learning algorithm, it can come up with a set of clusters, like people who are staying nearby,

133
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,920
people who are consistently getting lower grades, people who are consistently getting higher grades,

134
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,440
and so on and so forth. It can come up with any number of these kind of clusters. So we don't

135
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,680
tell them the result. So difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning

136
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,360
is that in supervised learning, we tell them the result. This means this, but in unsupervised

137
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,400
learning, we don't tell them the result. We ask machine learning algorithm to find out

138
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:41,280
interesting facts from the data. Now, third is reinforcement learning. It is also called

139
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:47,920
semi-supervised learning. It is a reward-based system. So all of the things you have heard about

140
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:54,720
games like somebody is learning chess, AlphaGo, any other thing, these all things are reward-based

141
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,440
system. So let's take an example for reinforcement learning. Let's assume that this is my cell phone.

142
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:11,520
This is just a simple robot. I want this robot to just roam around here, not to fall down.

143
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,040
What I will do is that I will give this guy a reward if it is not falling down within a minute.

144
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,680
So what this guy will do, this robot will do, is that this will generate a random number.

145
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,760
Random number will generate some random behavior, and random behavior will lead to some random

146
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,640
movement. So if it moves here, it will fall down. If it moves here, it will fall down. But

147
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,800
over a period of time, sooner or later, it will not fall down for one minute. And as soon as this

148
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,760
happens, this will learn it. Now, once it learns that, okay, I'm not falling down for one minute.

149
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,880
If I do this, it tries to maximize that. And over a period of time, it will never fall down.

150
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:04,400
That's the way reinforcement learning happens. Any questions? Because we will not be covering

151
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,720
an algorithm for reinforcement learning. So that's why I wanted to explain it very clearly.

152
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,320
Okay. Make sense?

153
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,440
How do we use that for reinforcement learning?

154
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:27,200
Okay. Reinforcement learning actually happens with the reward. So it collects the data which

155
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,880
leads to the reward. So these kind of movements leads to this kind of reward. For example, chess,

156
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,920
these movements lead to reward. It will remember that movement. That's the way it keeps on

157
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,200
accumulating all the data which leads to reward. And when it has lots and lots of data,

158
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,400
it finds the appropriate data for a particular situation the machine is put into. Okay.

159
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,080
So if you have seen pictures from Boston Dynamics, some dog, robotic dogs, and other things are

160
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,960
running. It's reinforcement learning. Okay. Let's go to chapter three.

161
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,320
We'll just introduce ourselves to scikit-learn. Basically, if you open the scikit-learn web page,

162
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,200
this is how it looks like. And you can see lots and lots of algorithms over here.

163
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,720
But the important thing is this. It is just as Python libraries for data mining and data analysis,

164
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,360
not only for machine learning. We will see one of that. And it is open source. It's built on

165
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:45,440
NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. And we will see NumPy and Matplotlib. And if you go to scipy.org,

166
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,640
this is what it looks like. SciPy consists of these core packages in which includes NumPy,

167
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:58,080
Matplotlib, and pandas. We will see pandas from SciPy. Okay. So scikit-learn is just a helper

168
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:05,200
library to help you start with machine learning. Okay. It just takes away all the complexities

169
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,880
of machine learning. So you can concentrate on data. Okay.

170
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:18,960
So you can just open the first Jupyter Notebook in Chapter 4.

171
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:37,520
Till now, anyone has any questions? Yes. Okay. So machine learning and data science are actually

172
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:44,000
a bit different fields. But data science is all about getting the valuable information from data.

173
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,160
Machine learning is learning from that and expanding that to take decisions where data

174
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,640
is not available. So machine learning uses data science to extract valuable information from data.

175
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,600
But data science can be a totally separate field altogether where we are just using different,

176
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,120
different methodologies to extract valuable information from data.

177
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,040
So data scientists just extract valuable information from data. There is a job for

178
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,600
data scientists because you know what? In the real world data, it doesn't come in the form of,

179
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,080
I mean, it's not decorated where we can just take it and dump into the machine learning

180
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,200
algorithms. It needs to change into a proper shape before we can do that.

181
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,760
So that's where data science comes into picture. You have this notebook open with you.

182
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:49,680
Introduction to NumPy. Yes. Okay. So what is NumPy? NumPy is also called Numeric Python.

183
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,880
And it's the first step towards your journey on machine learning with Python programming language

184
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:04,560
because everything that scikit-learn uses is based on NumPy as of now. If you are not aware

185
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,520
of NumPy, you can't use scikit-learn or for that matter any other machine learning algorithm.

186
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:21,680
So to use NumPy, you have to import NumPy as NP. You can import it as any name, but just like

187
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:27,200
self in Python, this is a kind of de facto standard. We use NP for NumPy. Okay.

188
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,240
Now what is NumPy used for? NumPy is used for creating N-dimensional arrays. Okay.

189
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,720
And to create N-dimensional array, what we will have to do is that we will have to call a function

190
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:49,200
called array and pass something similar to Python list over here. Okay. And my NumPy array is created.

191
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,520
Now all of you might be having a question right now is that if it is very similar to Python array,

192
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,400
I can create a Python array itself. Right? I mean, there is no difference between these two.

193
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:08,880
If I go ahead and print these two. Okay. Other than in Python array, I can see comma separated

194
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,560
values. There is no difference between these two. From the look of it, from the look of NumPy,

195
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:20,160
it may look like that creating array is an overhead. Because if I want to go ahead and

196
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,280
create Python list, it's very easy for me. I can just create the list. But in NumPy, I have to call

197
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:32,640
a function called array and pass the Python list into it. But there is a reason why we should use

198
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:43,040
NumPy. And the reason is there are two specific reasons. Reason number one is that NumPy array

199
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:49,360
takes less memory. If I say less means it's considerably less, much, much less memory than

200
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:59,440
Python list. And second thing is that NumPy is meant for mathematics. Okay. We will see how it

201
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,920
is different over here. So let's first see how memory usage are different. So I have created a

202
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:12,720
Python array called parr with the same 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as NumPy array narr with the same 1, 2, 3,

203
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:21,200
4, 5. Okay. So if I say length of parr, it will give me 5. Number of elements is 5. And if I want

204
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:30,240
to see how much memory in bytes occupied by each individual elements, in Python, I'll have to just

205
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,440
import this and I have to say get size of a particular integer because I am using integer.

206
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,640
Makes sense? This is correct, right? You must have used in Python, right? Checking the size of it.

207
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:50,720
How much it comes? 140. Okay. Let's check the same thing for NumPy arrays. So if I say length

208
00:23:51,360 --> 00:24:00,000
narr, it will say 5, which is same as Python list. But NumPy array also provides us some

209
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,040
of the data members which can be used to find the size. So if I use dot size, it will give me 5.

210
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:14,480
If I use dot item size, it gives me the size of individual elements. Okay. Which is 8.

211
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,400
And if I go ahead and multiply these two, you can see it's 40.

212
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,040
So what is happening over here is that for the same amount of data, Python list took 140 bytes

213
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:37,840
and NumPy array took 40 bytes. Does it makes the difference? Think about it. When you are

214
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,640
giving your data to machine learning algorithms, you must be giving lots and lots of data,

215
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:51,280
hundreds and thousands of rows, okay, if not millions. And if you combine all of those,

216
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:59,760
the amount of memory will explode if you use Python list, not with NumPy. Not only this,

217
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:07,040
there are further optimizations which are also possible with NumPy array. So we know that 1, 2,

218
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:19,360
3, 4, 5 can be stored in a single byte, right? If it is signed, 127, if it is unsigned, 255 can

219
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:27,440
be stored in a single byte. Okay. So I can actually provide a data type in the NumPy array. Okay.

220
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:35,360
I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. By default, you are taking int64. I don't need int64. What I want is that

221
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,240
int8. Okay. If I go ahead and do that, and then I check the size, it's just 5 bytes.

222
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:55,520
So 140, 240, 25. And that's the reason we should use NumPy. Okay. You must have heard about

223
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,600
something called a sparse matrix or dense matrix. It's extremely useful to create NumPy arrays

224
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,880
because it saves lots and lots of space. Are you getting the same output in your Jupyter notebooks?

225
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:14,000
So NumPy wins hands down over here. Yes, no, maybe. It's right. Because, you know,

226
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,320
it takes really less amount of memory. But there is no magic behind reduced size. Unlike Python lists,

227
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:29,120
NumPy arrays are homogeneous in nature. Okay. Which means that all the elements are

228
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:46,640
the same type. Now, if I can create a Python list like this, with integer, floating point,

229
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:53,200
string, and some number, I can do that. Okay. If I try to do the same thing with NumPy array,

230
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:10,720
can you try that and see what happens? Remember, I said that NumPy arrays are homogeneous in nature.

231
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:23,920
Yes. It works, right? So it works because what NumPy array does is that if it finds different

232
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:31,840
type of elements, it tries to find out the data type which can accommodate all of them. In here,

233
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,120
the string type. So if you go ahead and see NumPy array and the data type of NumPy array,

234
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,960
you can see that it's Unicode 32-bit less than sign means it is stored as little Indian.

235
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,520
Okay. So if I multiply NumPy array, 0th element, 10 times, I'll get

236
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:59,120
repetition of 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. But if I do the same with Python array, I'll get 10. Because

237
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,840
Python array gives me first element as an integer, not NumPy array. NumPy arrays will always be

238
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,240
homogeneous in nature. And it makes sense because mathematics is all about numbers.

239
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:17,280
Whether you have a string or any other data type, internally, it is all about numbers and machine

240
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:27,680
learning. Just use numbers. Makes sense, right? Okay. There is a simple exercise you can just

241
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:33,920
try out in 30 seconds maybe. Create a NumPy array with floating point and integer data types and

242
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,200
see what is the data type that is provided by NumPy arrays.

243
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:59,200
I mean, 30 seconds should be fine. Just try it out and let me know.

244
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,200
Okay. This is how it will look like. Just see what is the output of these two.

245
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:31,600
Okay. So you can see that if I provide both integer and floating point data types, it stores

246
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:40,480
by default as a float64. So NumPy arrays are homogeneous. That's very important. Okay.

247
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Because whatever we are going to look right now, it's based on this particular principle.

248
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,240
Now we talked about two reasons to use NumPy. One is memory. Right? We have seen that it takes

249
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,040
very less amount of memory. What is the second reason?

250
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:07,280
Okay. It is made for mathematics. Okay. Now let me create the Python array and NumPy array together.

251
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,680
And if I multiply Python array by two, what will happen?

252
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:28,080
It will just duplicate the array. Right? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Right? But if you multiply NumPy

253
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:36,800
array by two, here is what happens. It actually multiplies every element by two. So if you go

254
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:45,680
back to your mathematics days, if you say vector two before that, what does it mean? It means that

255
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:52,720
I want every element of the vector to be multiplied by two, not gets repeated. Okay. And that's what

256
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,920
is being taken care by NumPy array. Similarly, if I create a two-dimensional array,

257
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,080
both in Python array and NumPy, if I multiply Python array, it will repeat it. If I multiply

258
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,120
NumPy array, it will actually multiply each element by two. You can see one by two,

259
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:16,320
two multiplied by two, and so on and so forth. Remember matrix multiplication? If you just put

260
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,000
two before that, that means each element will be multiplied. So NumPy takes care of that implicitly.

261
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:31,520
If you use Python array, you'll have to do it explicitly. So there are two reasons to use NumPy.

262
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:37,920
One is that it takes less amount of memory. Second is it is made for mathematics.

263
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:48,720
Makes sense? So it's very important to know more detail about NumPy, but I am not combining

264
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,440
everything in one notebook. What I'm trying to do is that as we move further, we will explore

265
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:03,840
new functionalities of NumPy. Okay. Now, one thing about representing data in machine learning.

266
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,800
So no matter which programming language we use, whenever we create an array, we use to create

267
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,400
bracket one, two, three, four, five. This is the way we used to create the arrays in any

268
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:20,640
programming language. Right? Okay. And this is how it looks like. But in machine learning,

269
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:28,800
we generally represent numbers in column format, not in the row format. So if you consider this

270
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:36,240
as a vector, single column is called vector. So if you are creating an array for machine learning,

271
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:43,360
you will have to convert it into a column format. You will understand the reason once we go and see

272
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,320
the data later on, but it has to be converted into column format, not in the row format. Okay.

273
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:56,080
Now NumPy array provides a way to do it. We can just reshape it. Okay. So right now I have seven

274
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:03,600
elements. Okay. Right now what is the way it is arranged? One into seven. I want to arrange it

275
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:10,720
at seven into one. So if I do that, I'll get it in the column format. Now this reshape function

276
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:19,040
is intelligent. You can skip one dimension. You can just give minus one. The meaning of this is

277
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:26,160
that it says that, look, I want one column rows you decide. So end result will be same.

278
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:37,440
Or if I just say seven and minus one here, this means that, look, I want seven rows column you

279
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:45,360
decide. Same result. Okay. But we can't give minus one, minus one. We have to specify at least one

280
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:53,360
dimension. Okay. So if you go ahead and see the shape, it's seven one. If you go ahead and see

281
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:01,760
the dimension, it's two. So the number representation in machine learning is generally column vector,

282
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:11,920
not the row vectors. Okay. Make sense? Is it clear till now over here? Okay.

283
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:21,280
Okay. Now let's create a two-dimensional array with actually more than one column.

284
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,760
So once you have more than one column in terms of data science, mathematics, or machine learning,

285
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,760
it is called matrix. And let's generate more than two columns. Sorry. Two dimension.

286
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,840
So what we did till now is that we just passed the static values in numpy array.

287
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,640
We don't need to do that. There is a chair over here.

288
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:11,120
Okay. So numpy has various utility functions which can be used to generate some data. So there is a

289
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:19,760
function called arrange. It is similar to Python range. Right? If I say for loop x in range 10,

290
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:27,760
I get zero to 10. Right? So by default, it generates a number in a step of one. I can

291
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,320
provide a step which is a by default thing. I can provide a step as two or even I can provide a step

292
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:45,200
as 0.25. Okay. So arrange is inclusive exclusive, which means that zero is inclusive, 16 is exclusive.

293
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:56,480
So if I say zero to 16 in one, I'll get number zero to 15. Okay. Now let me use the reshape function

294
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,440
to convert this into a three-dimensional array. And here is how it will look like. And if I check

295
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,320
the shape and dimension, it will come as three and four to two. Okay. Now in terms of mathematics,

296
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,680
data science, and machine learning, anything which is beyond two dimensions is called tensor.

297
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:23,040
Okay. So vectors are called tensors of rank one. Matrix are called tensors of rank two.

298
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:30,560
And this is called tensor of rank three. And it goes on and on. Okay. You must have heard about

299
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:37,360
tensor flow. Right? So you know what it does, right? It's just a manipulation of numbers

300
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:46,320
in form of tensor. Even PyTorch does the same thing. So that's all about beginning of NumPy.

301
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,800
Okay. So you let's repeat. There are two specific reasons to use NumPy. One is that it takes very

302
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:04,800
less amount of memory. Second, it is meant for mathematics. Okay. These are some of the utility

303
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,920
function of NumPy. Like if I want to create an empty array of five, row vector five, I'll get

304
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:18,320
some empty. I can also create two dimensions. You might get different numbers over here. Okay.

305
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,560
Like this. So in terms of machine learning, many times you need to create data in a particular

306
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,160
dimension. So this NumPy functions will help you to create a structure where you can fill the data

307
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:46,560
later on. Yes? Which? Okay. The internal implementation generates anything between

308
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:53,440
zero to some random number. Okay. It can be anything. It's not actually empty. It takes some size.

309
00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:03,680
So can you do one exercise for me? It also takes 30 seconds to convert this two-dimensional array

310
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:22,880
into one-dimensional array using reshape. Just 30 seconds. Just try it once.

311
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:33,760
So if you want to add some cell over here, you can press A in Jupyter Notebook to create a cell

312
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:42,880
before the place where you are. If you say B, it will create a cell below your cell.

313
00:38:42,880 --> 00:39:00,240
Okay. You'll use something like this. Okay. So this is converting the two-dimensional array

314
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:08,080
into one-dimensional array. This is reshaping it to two-five. Okay. And this is like 10 row,

315
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:15,040
one column. Okay. So the only condition of reshape is that the multiplicity factor should

316
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:21,200
match. We cannot say three into five. Everything should come to 10. As long as it is matching the

317
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:36,560
multiplicity factor, reshape will work fine. Okay. So you're good with NumPy, right? At least

318
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:47,120
basics of it. Okay. Now, you know what? I wanted to give you an exercise as a homework. I guess

319
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:53,360
this is the right time to talk about it. Once you go back after this tutorial, let's do one thing.

320
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:01,280
You start collecting data about yourself for a month, actually. Right? Things like what time you

321
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,680
wake up, what time you go for bed, what was your fooding habits on that day, whether you were happy

322
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,560
on that day or you went somewhere out, something like that, whatever you can come up with, number

323
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,080
of times you took coffee or anything like that. Even if you miss for one or two days, please keep

324
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:26,160
on collecting this data for at least a month. Okay. Once you do that, apply whatever you are

325
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:34,560
going to learn today on that data. Two benefits. One, you will really understand what is the meaning

326
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,080
of machine learning. Second, you'll find some interesting facts about yourself.

327
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:48,720
You can keep on doing that for second month, third month, and apply the same thing again. See?

328
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:58,240
As long as it's between you and your husband. I guess it should be fine.

329
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:10,960
Okay. There are some utility functions. You can see it in the Jupyter Notebooks. Let's go to 4.2,

330
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:19,680
which is introduction to Matplotlib. Human eyes are very bad in judging the text or numbers,

331
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:29,440
but very good in visualizing the pictures. Right? So, Matplotlib is a 2D plotting library.

332
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,120
We'll just glance through it, how we can use it. It is used for plotting. While you are doing

333
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:42,080
something, you can plot it. Okay? So, you will have to include matplotlib.pyplot. Again, as PLT,

334
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:50,240
you can name it as anything. And you import numpy. I just create a x and y numpy array.

335
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:57,920
And this is how I can plot it. Just say plot and x and y. And this is what you will get.

336
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,720
If you open your Jupyter Notebooks, you can just press shift enter. You'll get this. To execute

337
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:13,200
a cell, you need to press shift enter. Talking about 4.2, notebook chapter 4, 4.2. Okay.

338
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:25,200
And we can also do customized plotting, right? I didn't like the blue line. I want a red line

339
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:36,640
or a green line. I can also give RGB as a short form for red, green, and blue. Okay? We'll be

340
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,800
using this Matplotlib to understand our own data. So, that's the reason I am explaining this.

341
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,880
You can also use color symbol like red color plus symbol. You can see that plus symbol is

342
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:58,560
there of red color. Green color is star symbol. And blue color circle. Okay? Or triangle, red color

343
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:06,480
triangle. Or you want a dotted line in different, different color. This is the thing which you may

344
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:13,120
end up using is like dotted line with markings where the data are or triangles where the data

345
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,280
are. Simple different, different choices of how you want to plot your own graph.

346
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,040
Okay? Once you plot that, you can actually set X and Y axis labels.

347
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:34,480
You can see the X axis, Y axis. Okay? You can even set axis values. Right now, the values are

348
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,960
dependent on the NumPy array I gave. You can set axis value as X mean X max, Y mean Y max.

349
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:48,080
And if I go ahead and do that, you can see that axis values are being set. So, this much is good

350
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:54,320
enough for 80% of the requirement. But, again, Matplotlib is quite complex. And it has various

351
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,760
functionalities. But this much should be good enough for this tutorial. Is it executing? Are

352
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,120
you able to plot in your system with using notebook? Anyone having any issue?

353
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,120
Can you try to do it in a different cell?

354
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:35,120
In 3.7, I don't think you need inline. If you're... Okay.

355
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:47,120
If you have latest navigator, you don't need to use Matplotlib inline.

356
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,120
Last thing about Matplotlib is that you can actually plot multiple values together

357
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:04,560
in one graph to compare. Okay? And you can even select the style of two graphs, how you want to

358
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:11,760
plot it. This is very easy. Just you need to know what you need to provide.

359
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,760
So, if you're not getting the plot, maybe you can try this.

360
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:32,320
This comma. Okay? If you have downloaded the latest Anaconda navigator, this is not required.

361
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:39,120
Old one, you have to put this in the top of the line. Okay?

362
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:48,080
Okay. So, now let's actually start the tutorial. So, let's start with the

363
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:56,240
machine learning. Okay? Okay. So, now let's actually start seeing some data for machine learning.

364
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,880
So, whenever we learn programming, we start with Hello World. Right? All of us started with Hello

365
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:09,280
World. Similarly, there is a Hello World dataset for scikit-learn for machine learning. Is it

366
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:24,240
visible to you guys? At the back, is it visible? Okay. Now, I'm showing this Hello World dataset

367
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,520
of machine learning from scikit-learn to make you aware about the fact how the data is actually

368
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,920
stored. So, there are two things which you need to know. One is feature. Another is label.

369
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,400
So, feature is a set of data representing specific characteristics,

370
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,160
and label is the result of those characteristics. So, let's see this picture. Can you see this picture?

371
00:46:52,480 --> 00:47:00,320
Okay. What does it look like? It's a result sheet. Right? So, it's the marks on first,

372
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,440
second, third, and fourth semester for different, different subjects. Science,

373
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:11,680
maths, English, social science, and the result. So, these marks in individual subjects are called

374
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:21,760
features, and results are called labels. So, in machine learning, especially with scikit-learn,

375
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:29,280
whatever data you get, you get some features and then some labels. Feature can be anything.

376
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:36,400
Right? And feature can be 10, 20, 100, 200, 1000, anything like that. Okay.

377
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,320
So, right now, yes?

378
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:51,280
I guess this one is not. PNGs are not there yet. There are some issues with upload. I'm not sure why.

379
00:47:51,280 --> 00:48:10,000
So, can you see it now? Okay. Got it? What is the meaning of features and labels? So, you know what?

380
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:17,040
I told you about supervised learning algorithms. Like, we tell what is the result. Right? So,

381
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:23,120
here I'm saying that if you get at least 40 in science, 30 in maths, English, 20 in English,

382
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:31,680
or 33 in social science, you are passed. This is what I'm telling my machine learning model.

383
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:38,640
But if you get 32, 21, 20, 22, you are failed. So, my machine learning model will identify

384
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:47,600
who is passed, who is failed based on features. So, any data that you use for supervised learning

385
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:59,600
algorithm contain two things, features and labels. Okay? Features and labels. Clear? Right? Any questions?

386
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:09,120
So, there is a data called Iris data and it contains four features and a single label.

387
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:17,520
So, this dataset is used for differentiating three types of species of a particular flower.

388
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,880
And this is how the flower looks like. This is an image from Wikipedia. Okay. There are three

389
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:30,720
species of the same flower called Iris centosa, Versicolor and Virginica. Okay.

390
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,040
So, these three species are identified by four features and the features are called

391
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:45,600
sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. Okay. You can see that these

392
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,320
sepals and petals are a bit different. I think the top which is there is called petals. Bottom

393
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:57,760
small one is called sepals. These are different. So, based on these characteristics, length of

394
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:04,240
each sepal and petal in centimeter, we will identify which flower species it belongs to.

395
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:15,280
Make sense? Okay. So, let's see how we can import this dataset. Okay.

396
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:23,280
So, scikit-learn datasets has lots and lots of datasets. One is Iris. We can import load

397
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:30,720
Iris. Okay. And we create the instance of load Iris. And this is how Iris DB looks like. Okay.

398
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,440
You can see there is something called data.

399
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:44,800
Target, target names and description. Okay. So, let's see them separately.

400
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:46,580
Okay.

401
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,000
This is what data looks like. So, data contains four features.

402
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:02,240
What are those? Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width. So, these are sepal length,

403
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:08,480
sepal width, petal length and petal width in centimeters. And what is the target?

404
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:21,200
Target. Whether it is a particular species of flower, what 0, 1, 2 represent, we can get to

405
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:28,720
know by using target names. 0 represents centosa. 1 represents versicolor. 2 represents virginica.

406
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:37,360
Okay. And these are feature names. Sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. Okay.

407
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:48,160
Now, let's see the type of all these data. You can see that all of them is actually given to you

408
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:56,800
as numpy and dimensionary. None of this data will be provided to you as a Python list here.

409
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,300
Okay.

410
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:10,320
No. Target, yes, target is the label. Okay. Data is the feature. Target is the label.

411
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,640
So, in the terms of machine learning, it is called features and labels.

412
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:21,920
Here it is data and results. So, target is the result. It can be called as labels. Okay.

413
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:31,840
So, I would like to tell you that everything that is happening in scikit-learn is actually a numpy

414
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:37,600
array. Okay. So, we can use numpy array data types to understand various things that number of rows,

415
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:45,120
column, number of data and so on and so forth. Okay. So, this is the hello world data set

416
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:51,200
from scikit-learn. We will not be using now. What we will do is that we will generate our

417
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:56,160
own data set for better understanding. Okay. And then we will use iris data set.

418
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,600
So, you know what this data set is all about. This data set can be used for supervised learning

419
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:10,560
or unsupervised learning. It has features and labels. Supervised learning, right? Because

420
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,960
we tell what is correct, right? And it has to learn from it.

421
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:24,480
Okay. Let's open chapter 6, our first machine learning algorithm.

422
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:33,680
It will take some time over here, but it will be worth it, I guess. So, linear regression,

423
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,000
all of you have heard about, right? It's a supervised learning algorithm for regression

424
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,800
values based on learning prior data. So, what we will do is that we will not use a readymade

425
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,240
data. We will generate our own data and here is how the data will look like. Okay. Let's assume

426
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:58,400
that a farmer is producing some vegetable and the farmer sells the same vegetable in a local

427
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:06,240
farm market, which is four miles from the farm. The farmer sells it for $10. In the village,

428
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:13,040
which is 12 miles from the place, the same thing is being sold for $28. In the town, which is 25

429
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:19,680
miles from the farmer's place, same thing is being sold for $54. In a city, which is 52 miles,

430
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:25,520
same thing is being sold for $84. Downtown, which is 60 miles, same thing is being sold for $90.

431
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:38,160
Just five data points. Okay. So, we'll have to plot this in x and y axis. Okay. So,

432
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,040
how to decide what will be x and what will be y?

433
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:50,240
Okay. So, what you want to know is y. So, in here, I want to know that

434
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:59,280
what will be the price at 30th mile? The data is not here. Okay. So, that will be x axis,

435
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:06,080
miles will be at x axis, actual value in dollars will be y axis. Make sense? So,

436
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:12,480
this is a very simple data and we can actually analyze the result. And that's why we are just

437
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:20,160
taking five points. Okay. This data is clear, right? It's a single farm product. You may consider

438
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:26,080
that one lb of something is being sold at the local place for $10. Same thing is being sold

439
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:33,760
in downtown for $90. This is, again, a made-up thing. It may not be true. Okay. So, what I do

440
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:39,600
is that I create a numpy array first and create a distance and price. Okay. Because I have to use

441
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:48,800
numpy array. So, distance is miles, price is dollars. Okay. Now, remember what I told you

442
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:55,280
that single row of number has to be represented as column vectors in machine learning. So, we'll

443
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:02,720
have to convert x distance into column vectors. Right? If I do reshape, I get the same thing

444
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:08,800
as a column vector. But what will happen if I just try to print x distance again?

445
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:18,400
Can you try that? What happened? Huh? Yeah, it's unchanged. You know what? So, what happens is that

446
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:25,840
when you call a reshape function, it gives you a new numpy array. Okay. If you want to use it

447
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:32,160
in place, you will have to change the shape manually like this. And then you can see that

448
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:43,840
it is changed. So, reshape implicitly doesn't change in place. Same for y price. So, I have

449
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:53,120
converted both the data, distance and price, as a column vectors. Okay. Let's plot it using Matplot

450
00:56:53,120 --> 00:57:00,080
lib. We know how to plot it. So, if you plot it, this is how it will look like. These are dollars

451
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:07,440
and these are miles. Okay. Till now, things are clear, right? Which data we are looking into right

452
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:14,880
now? Okay. So, let's use linear regression. What we will do is that first we will use linear

453
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,080
regression provided by scikit-learn. Then we will decode it piece by piece. And to understand how

454
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:25,600
it actually works. Okay. So, to use linear regression from scikit-learn, we will have to

455
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:32,880
import linear regression from a linear model. And we will also have to import matrix. And we will

456
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,600
have to import from matrix mean squared error. We will come to know in a moment why we need these

457
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:46,880
two things. But let's import these two. Now, as I said that scikit-learn makes things very easy for

458
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:52,800
all of you. Because it provides a unified machine learning interface in just three lines.

459
00:57:54,320 --> 00:58:01,200
Everything is done. Okay. No matter whether you are creating an instance of supervised learning

460
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:09,760
algorithm, unsupervised learning algorithm, you just use three lines. Okay. So, what you do is

461
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:17,040
that you create the instance of the algorithm. Okay. And pass some algorithm specific parameters.

462
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:23,840
You call the fit function. Fit is the training function, right? I pass x and y in fit. My

463
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:29,280
machine learning model is trained. And I use predict function to predict the data. That's all.

464
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:36,720
And if I change this linear regression to logistic regression, KNN, anything, it's the same thing.

465
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:44,320
Create the instance, call fit, call predict. As simple as that. So, it takes away all the pain

466
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,680
of doing things manually in case of machine learning. Okay. So, this is a unified interface

467
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:56,640
provided by scikit-learn. Okay. So, here is how we will be using it. So, let's create the instance

468
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:04,000
of linear regression. Create it. Call the fit function with distance and price. Done. Okay.

469
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:11,520
Now, we have our machine learning model trained. Actually trained on the data we have provided.

470
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:19,360
The data was distance in miles and the price at a particular point. Okay. Now, we can predict the

471
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:29,920
value. Let's predict what will be the price at 45th mile. Okay. Now, I am putting this 45 mile also

472
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:35,840
as a column vector even if it's a single data. Okay. And if I go ahead and predict, it gives me

473
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:44,480
$73.26. Okay. So, let's predict it with the original data points. From the look of it,

474
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:50,240
at least, from the visual look of it, this looks to be correct. Right. What will be the price at

475
00:59:50,240 --> 01:00:02,000
45th mile? It says $73. And $45 is between $25 and $52. At $25, it was $54. At $52, it was $84.

476
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,960
And $73 comes in between. So, from the look of it, at least, it looks correct. Right. Yes, no, maybe.

477
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:17,680
Looks correct. Right. Till now, it makes sense. Right. Scikit-learn provides a unified machine

478
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:24,160
learning interface. What we do is that we create the instance of a class for a particular algorithm.

479
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:29,200
We call the fit function. We call the predict function. In fit function, we provide our X and Y.

480
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:40,080
Okay. I can also predict for multiple values. So, here I have close to nine values. Okay. This is

481
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:48,800
how it looks like. So, just consider this. I trained my machine learning model with just five

482
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:55,040
values. Right. Distance were five distances, 10 miles, 25 miles, and so on and so forth.

483
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:02,480
But I can use predict for predicting even 100. It will work. It's not that my training data was

484
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:07,280
just five points. I can only predict one or two points. I can predict any number of points.

485
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,320
If I go ahead and predict that, you can see that it is predicting things. And again, from the visual

486
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:19,840
look of it, it looks to be doing really well. Okay. These greens are being predicted. These red

487
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:28,960
are the original data points. Okay. So, till now, it's clear how we can use Scikit-learn algorithms.

488
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:36,800
Create the instance. Call the fit function to train. Call the predict function to get back

489
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:46,800
the predictions. We'll have to provide column vectors. Clear? Okay. Now, let's understand linear

490
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:52,320
regression. So, it's not needed to understand complete mathematics behind all the algorithms,

491
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:59,360
but it's actually useful to know what it does behind the scene. If we can at least understand

492
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:04,640
one mathematics behind linear regression, it actually opens up lots and lots of opportunity

493
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:12,400
for us to explore the algorithm. Now, what linear regression does is that it attempts to generate

494
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:18,080
a best fit line, which is generally a straight line in these x, y cases, but it need not be a

495
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:23,840
straight line. Okay. It can be a quadratic line also. Okay. Just for simplicity purposes,

496
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:30,560
we are using a straight line. Now, when we say it generates a best fit line, what is the meaning of

497
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:41,200
best fit? Best fit means that align with least mean squared error. Okay. So, you remember we have

498
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:46,080
imported two things from Scikit-learn, linear regression as well as mean squared error.

499
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:51,840
And mean squared error is imported to check the mean square of best fit line. Okay.

500
01:02:51,840 --> 01:03:05,440
Now, one very important thing. I know all of us during our childhoods would have hated one or two

501
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:11,040
subjects, right? So, what we do is that we just mug up things because we have to pass exams on

502
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:16,000
those subjects and just give the exam. If the same question comes, okay, I pass with flying colors.

503
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:25,840
Okay. So, we don't learn, but we mug up things. Machine learning doesn't do that. Okay. It doesn't

504
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:34,160
mug up things. It learns from it. What does this mean? This means that if I said that at 10th,

505
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:43,520
let's say at 4th mile, the price is $10. Okay. And at 90th mile, the price is $80.

506
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:49,280
And if I ask my machine learning algorithm that, okay, what is the price at 4th mile?

507
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:56,640
It will not necessarily give me the same what I have provided to it. It can give me, okay, 10,

508
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:01,920
which was what I have provided. It can give me 9. It can give me 13. Because it doesn't

509
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:08,320
mug up anything. It comes up with a best fit line and learn the algorithm. And that algorithm

510
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:14,080
may give you different results. Okay. So, never assume that if you provided something on your

511
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:18,880
training data and you are asking question based on your training data, it will give you the same

512
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,360
answer and always correct answer because it was there in your training data. That assumption is

513
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:30,560
wrong. Okay. That assumption is right for us because we mug up things. Okay. You said this,

514
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:36,960
then this is the value. No. Machine learning doesn't do that. This has to be remembered.

515
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:42,240
This has to be remembered because whenever you use it, you will say that, okay, you know,

516
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,360
it's not giving the value even if I provided it with the training data.

517
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:54,880
So, let's see the mean square error value. Now, as I said that my machine learning algorithm may or

518
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:00,400
may not give me the data which I have provided in training set. So, let's see. In the predict,

519
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,600
I am passing the same distance what I have provided in my training set. And let's see what it

520
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:11,040
gives me. It gives me something different, right? For all of you, it will give you something

521
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:17,120
different. It gives 16, 27, 45. None of them is what I have actually provided in the machine

522
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:26,240
learning training. Right? So, let's plot it to see the difference. Okay. These red points are

523
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:32,160
my original data. And this green line is what is being provided to me by my machine learning

524
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:37,520
algorithm, linear regression. You can see that only two points here and here are approximately

525
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:45,760
closer. Okay. So, it may or may not provide you same data even if you have provided the things

526
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:51,280
with the training data because it learns from all the data you have provided. It doesn't remember

527
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:58,160
each and every point. Okay. Now, let's calculate mean square error. What is the meaning of mean

528
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:04,080
square error? I know the correct values of these five points, but you are giving me something

529
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:09,360
different. What is the sum square difference between this point, this point, this point,

530
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:17,200
this point and this point? This is called mean square error. Sum of square difference between

531
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:22,880
original point and predicted point. And we don't need to do the mathematics because

532
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,440
scikit-learn provides a function called mean square error. And if I just go ahead and use it,

533
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:33,760
it will give me the mean square error as 26.07. Now, what my machine learning algorithm is saying

534
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:46,720
that this is the best fit line for your data. Okay. So, let's understand the maths behind linear

535
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:52,240
regression and how it works. Okay. This is bit text, but I think it will be important.

536
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:59,840
So, all of us know that the equation of straight line is y equal to mx plus b. Somebody says that

537
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:06,400
m alpha plus beta m alpha plus alpha one or something like this. So, this is y equal to mx plus b.

538
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:15,200
So, if I have x distance and I have to find out y, I have two missing values over here.

539
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:22,480
One is called m, one is called b. m is called slope and b is called y intercept.

540
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:31,280
Okay. So, slope is calculated using this formula like y end minus y begin divided by x end minus

541
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:40,720
x begin. So, this is our data. y end is 90, y begin is 10, x end is 60, x begin is 4. If I go

542
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:49,520
ahead and calculate slope, it comes to 1.42. Right? So, slope is y two minus y one divided

543
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:54,480
by x two minus x one. So, we used only two points when we learned mathematics. That's why we say y

544
01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:01,600
two minus y one is in fact y end to end between two points. It's y end, y begin, x end, x begin.

545
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:12,160
Okay. Now, let's we have m. So, we have x, we have m, we need to find y. y intercept means value of

546
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:16,800
y when x equal to zero. There is a different equation called point slope equation which is

547
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:23,600
defined as y minus y one equal to mx minus x one. We can substitute x one and y one over here.

548
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:31,520
And so, y one is 10, x one is 4. We just go ahead doing the basic mathematics

549
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:40,000
and we will come to a point where it is represented as 1.42x plus 4.32. Okay. So,

550
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:50,080
if we substitute the y equal to 1.42x plus 4.32, m will be 1.42. We already know b will be 4.32.

551
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:59,360
That's intercept, right? This is what we get from mathematics. Now, you must be wondering

552
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:05,360
that what is the value of m and b provided by my linear regression algorithm. So, let's see.

553
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:19,360
It says 1.39 is m and 10.55 is b. What we got it 1.42 and 4.32.

554
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:24,080
Just by using mathematics and this is what my machine learning algorithm gives me. Okay.

555
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:29,200
As I told you in the beginning that there is a difference between mathematics and machine

556
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:35,680
learning, right? So, the same difference can come over here. Now, let's understand how we can get

557
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:41,040
this particular m and b value because my machine learning algorithm says this is the best fit value

558
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:51,280
which means this is the m and b values. Okay. I will not like you to do the exercise because

559
01:09:51,280 --> 01:10:01,280
we are running out of time. So, let's put a let's use m and b to get the y value.

560
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:09,360
Okay. This is what I am getting if I am using my m and b which I have calculated using pure

561
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:17,200
mathematics. Okay. And let's see what is our mean square error is. It's coming as 55.89. So,

562
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:22,320
in your notebook this might not be there because I wanted you to do this exercise. But again,

563
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,160
so once this session is over I will upload everything including the PNGs and all those

564
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:31,920
things. So, you can just reuse this notebook once again. Okay.

565
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:45,680
So, our mean square is 55.89. Okay. So, let's plot all three of them. Okay. So, this green is what

566
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:53,120
comes when I use pure mathematics. This is blue is what provided by linear regression algorithm.

567
01:10:53,120 --> 01:11:01,200
Okay. And these rates are the original points. Okay. Make sense? So, till now are you getting

568
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:07,040
the sense what is happening over here? Right. I use linear regression algorithm. I find out

569
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:13,680
that m and b values are somethings and I use mathematics to find out that they are different.

570
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:21,280
Okay. Now, the idea is to get the best line and the mathematical term is called gradient descent.

571
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:28,320
Okay. Just a note that you don't need gradient descent to come up with the best line. You can

572
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,720
just randomly generate some number and keep on trying, keep on trying. Sooner or later you will

573
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:38,080
come up with the best line. But with gradient descent mathematics you will get it sooner.

574
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:45,200
Okay. That's the only reason why we use gradient descent. Okay. So, mathematics behind gradient

575
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:56,160
descent is derived from calculus. So, we do partial derivative because in gradient descent

576
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:03,600
what we do is that we want to change m and see what happens. We want to change b and see what

577
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:09,200
happens. Okay. So, this is the sum mean squared error formula is original minus predicted whole

578
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:15,440
square of all. Right. Sum of mean square error. So, this y predicted can be substituted with mx

579
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:22,800
plus b. Okay. So, if I want to do a partial derivative with respect to m, this will come

580
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:29,680
as minus 2x y minus mx plus b. This can be simplified as minus 2x y minus mx plus b.

581
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:41,520
Y original is what we have provided with our data set. This is predicted. What we are predicting now.

582
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:49,600
Original is original dollars at that particular distance. Predicted is what we get when we apply

583
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:55,440
our m and b values. Okay. If you simplify this, this will come as y minus mx plus b.

584
01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:02,560
Mx plus b can be substituted with y predicted. Okay. So, basically y original minus y predicted

585
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:09,200
minus 2x is what happens when you change m. Similarly, if you change b. So, there are many

586
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:14,720
online calculus things where you just put this formula. It will tell you step by step how it is

587
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:21,840
being done. This is simplified as minus 2y minus mx minus b which is simplified as minus 2y minus

588
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:30,000
mx plus b. So, this can be simplified as minus 2y minus y predicted. This y is original. This is y

589
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:38,640
predicted. Okay. So, once we have the gradient, gradient descent is a mathematical way of finding

590
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:46,240
the proper value, proper minimum. Okay. Beyond which you cannot find the best value. Okay.

591
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,600
So, once we have this gradient, we can apply this formula to our

592
01:13:52,240 --> 01:14:00,560
m and b and get the new values. Okay. So, let's do this. Okay.

593
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:11,280
So, I start with m and b value with zero. Iterations is 100,000. Let me put it thousand first.

594
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:18,160
Number of iterations are called epochs in machine learning. So, if you create a neural network

595
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:23,120
instance using Keras or any other things, wherever you encounter the term epochs,

596
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:28,720
its number of times these things will be done. I said learning rate, it has to be very small.

597
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:32,720
Otherwise, there are chances that things will escape. You will not be able to find the local

598
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:39,520
minima. And n is number of elements. Okay. So, what I am trying to do is that 1000 times,

599
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:48,320
I calculate the new y value. Okay. And I am getting the gradient. Like you can see that sum of

600
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:57,520
2x into y predicted minus y original minus y predicted. 2x y original minus y predicted.

601
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:07,680
For b, 2y original minus y predicted minus 2y original minus y predicted. Okay. And I multiply

602
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:15,120
each of them by learning rate. And if I do that, my bn m value changes to 1.6 and 0.72.

603
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:22,080
And my original values are 1.39 and 10.55. Of course, this is not great. So, we have to increase

604
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:29,600
the iterations. So, let's do it for 100,000 times. Star means still calculating. It will take some

605
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:48,960
time. Come on. Okay. You can see that it came very near to the original value. 1.39, 10.54.

606
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:55,200
Okay. And this is what our linear regression algorithm does internally.

607
01:15:55,200 --> 01:16:03,040
Okay. So, linear regression algorithm, it takes the gradient descent and tries to find the local

608
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:09,040
minima. Okay. We can do it any number of times and we can have any starting values. Okay. Let's say

609
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:16,400
starting value is 2000 or 300, for example. Sooner or later, it will find this value.

610
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:25,120
But you should either start with 0 or mn b value you get from mathematics. Why is that?

611
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:29,840
Any reason you can think of?

612
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:44,160
Okay. So, if we don't provide either 0 or mn b we got from mathematics, we don't add any biases,

613
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,200
which means that if you provide random values, it will take more number of iterations to come

614
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:55,360
to local minima. If you use 0, it will take less number of iterations to come to local minima.

615
01:16:55,360 --> 01:17:03,920
That's the only reason we use 0. Otherwise, you are free to use any number you want. Yes.

616
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:17,920
Correct.

617
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:34,960
Well, you care about those decimal spaces if it actually impacts your result. So,

618
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:40,000
right now what we are seeing while we are learning is very simple small amount of data set.

619
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,680
For example, if you are getting data for, let's say, black hole data,

620
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:49,920
even small changes in those decimal points can give you a different result.

621
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:56,000
So, if you have that much data and that much precision is required, it is required.

622
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:02,800
But in normal terms, it is not required. It's only for scientific reasons it is required.

623
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,840
If you are doing scientific computing, yes, you have to take care of those precisions.

624
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:15,040
Because a small amount of difference means a lot if you are considering the distance

625
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:22,000
between galaxies and so on and so forth. Yes.

626
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:33,520
Okay. The learning rate is that, okay, I have to change. Let's say you change,

627
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:39,200
M and B says that you change with, let's say, 10 steps. I said that don't do 10 steps. You might

628
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:46,320
skip the door. Just do very small step. That's what learning rate is. It has to be very small.

629
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:53,200
Otherwise, our intention is to find local minima. If we give bigger learning rate,

630
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:59,520
we may keep on just rotating around and skipping the door. Okay. So, I guess it's 10, 15.

631
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:06,240
Okay. So, 15. Snacks will be over. So, you can go for snacks and come back. Then we'll continue.

632
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:18,320
As soon as possible. 10 minutes should be good enough. Okay. You can bring your snacks.

633
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,160
In the meantime, anyone has any questions, I am free to answer.

634
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,520
Yes.

635
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,520
Yes, you can use.

636
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:03,520
Okay.

637
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,520
Okay.

638
