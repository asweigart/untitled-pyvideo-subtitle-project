1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
All right. Hello, everybody. Let's get started. Our speaker today is Ferris. He is the founder

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,200
of the Salt Lake City Python meetup and the head Python janitor at team. He's going to

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,240
talk to us about meetups. Take it away, Ferris.

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:28,200
Hey, how's it going, everybody? Everybody have any good PyCon? Yeah. So welcome to the

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:35,760
biggest meetup of them all. PyCon 2019. I'm hoping everybody is having a good time today.

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,400
Yeah, this is my little talk. I have a quick poll before we get started. Who here has attended

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,880
a meetup? Yeah, like pretty much everybody in the audience. I dig it. Now keep your hand

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:54,560
up if it was a Python meetup. Still a few. Okay. And then now keep your hand if you've

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,400
helped organize a Python meetup. Excellent. I want all these people who are still raising

10
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,200
their hands after this, give them a pat on the back because this stuff is hard, okay?

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,560
This is the human side of stuff. So, yeah, let's get started here. First off, who am

12
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,280
I? I started the Salt Lake City Python meetup group accidentally. I think that's how a lot

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:25,280
groups accidentally. I'm a big fan of the Django meetup in Vancouver. That was one of

14
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,680
the ones I used to go to a lot. Anybody from Vancouver, Canada? Yeah, up in here. And then

15
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,920
the bad old days of the Salt Lake Linux users group, they were good old days. Yeah, I started

16
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,560
the meetup group in a coffee shop when I saw a couple individuals sitting there with their

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,440
Django admin tools open up. I was like, hey, is that Django? Are you guys doing some Django

18
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,920
programming? Let's talk about this. And we realized there wasn't a meetup group that

19
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:03,920
was that close to us. So let me show you a little bit of Utah's geography. So this is

20
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,720
Utah right here. We're the one that's not on fire at present. So this is pretty much

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,720
what the summer looks like. No, we get lots of fires, too. If you're trying to avoid burnout

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,000
in the valley in Pacific Northwest, you can literally avoid it by going to Utah sometimes,

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
it looks like. But yeah, we're this state over here. A little bit about our first Salt

24
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,440
Lake City meetup. Oh, dear. It's the wrong slide for some reason. Yeah. My apologies

25
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,880
here. Okay. That slide's not showing up. So I'm going to point it out over here. So the

26
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,240
original meetup used to be all the way down here. And here's downtown Salt Lake City.

27
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,800
So our first meetup, we decided to restart in a little lovely named neighborhood called

28
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,560
Sugar House. Yes, that is literally the name of the neighborhood. Utah's quite a fantasy

29
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,000
place. And now we're at the University of Utah. We just call this the U. They're very

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,360
picky about calling it the U. And then I have to give a few disclaimers. So I've been thinking

31
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:15,280
about this talk for like three years. And I finally submitted it. And then I ended up

32
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,760
getting bought by WeWork. Like our company was bought by WeWork. And as you might know,

33
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,000
WeWork also owns Meetup. So this is my legal disclaimer. I'm not speaking on behalf of

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
WeWork or Meetup. This is Ferris right here talking to his fellow Pythonistas. So only

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,400
giving my personal experiences. You might have your own ideas. And we're going to talk

36
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,240
about that in room 16 at 16 o'clock after this. So we're going to have like a there's

37
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,600
a secondary thing. If you're an organizer, I encourage you to go. If you go to Meetups,

38
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,240
I encourage you to go. And we can have more discussion about that. So who here has ever

39
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:56,120
gotten this email right here? Anybody? Yeah. Yeah. You're like, my Meetup group's going

40
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,320
to shut down. All those people, all that Python, all those lessons. I'm going to have to drive

41
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,440
four or five hours away to go to another Meetup group if that. And who knows if that's going

42
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,760
to work out. So you do what anybody does. And you click that giant red button to keep

43
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,320
the Meetup going. And you're going to keep this group going. And you know what? It's

44
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,600
just going to be easy. You just have to find a space and pizza. And you have to keep track

45
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,560
of money. Uh-oh. You're going to need some help. Because guess what? You're now the organizer

46
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,280
of a Meetup group. And this is exactly what happened to me almost or more than five years

47
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,160
ago. And I have some like number one thing that you should get out of this talk. Guess

48
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:46,160
what? It's going to be okay. Okay? You're at this presentation. So let's go over a quick

49
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,340
checklist. So first things first. If you're taking over a Meetup, you should do these

50
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,280
three things. Okay? First thing you should do is you're going to ensure that your Meetup

51
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,240
group is not scripted. Sorry. Ensure that your dues are paid, obviously. But you're

52
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,040
also going to chat with the old organizer. Why are they stepping down? It could be the

53
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,960
case that there's just a glitch. They're changing their email or they click the wrong button

54
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,720
and then they immediately hop back on five minutes later. But good for you for clicking

55
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,440
that red button anyway and trying to snatch that Meetup. And yes, this did actually happen

56
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,880
to me as well. It was like, oh, I'm going to do this other Meetup. No. They were just

57
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,840
doing something. They still wanted to run the Meetup. Make sure your dues are paid.

58
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,960
And reintroduce yourself to the members. So once you click that button, you're going to

59
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,480
get a bunch of Meetup tools. One of them is email your members. Email them. Let them

60
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,840
know who you are. Let them know that, hey, this Meetup is going to keep going. And that

61
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,720
last point could be tricky. Okay? Because you're putting yourself out in the world.

62
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,040
And if you're not really ready to do that, maybe don't organize a Meetup quite yet, but

63
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,560
keep going to them. That's my advice there. And one more thing, you've got to plan and

64
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,520
schedule your next Meetup. Make sure that is ready to go. Don't do it immediately. Give

65
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,640
yourself like four weeks. But you're going to have to plan. And we're going to go through

66
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,640
how to do that as well. And again, seriously, it's going to be okay. And you know why that

67
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:07,640
is? Because Python has a superpower. Does anybody know what it is? Is it the interpretation?

68
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:14,640
No. Is it the ubiquity? Kind of. But what's the greatest superpower of Python? It's the

69
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,360
community. Yeah. Who said that? You said that. Yes. Thank you. So you being here today, right

70
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,400
now, it shows that you recognize this. Okay? It's the second best language for everything,

71
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,040
but the community. It's the number one in community. I've been to other conferences

72
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,280
where they reference PyCon and the Python community as an exemplar community of what

73
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,280
they want for their standards. So here's a picture, by the way. This is our soiree we

74
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,440
hold every year. This is our community. This is our little Salt Lake City Python community.

75
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,600
We have a once-a-year anniversary. I have to tell you, these 27 Pythonistas who made

76
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,360
it, we made it through a foot of snow. This was some of the worst snowfall that we had

77
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,300
that day. And it just happened to coincide with our fifth year anniversary. And they

78
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,760
all made it. So the Python community is awesome. And what that means is that if you're part

79
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,600
of a community of programmers, that means that programming isn't the thing anymore.

80
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,080
Programming is just a tool. We shouldn't call ourselves programmers. We should call ourselves

81
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,400
whatever we're doing. You don't call somebody who pours cement like a cement pourer. You

82
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,560
call them a landscaper, right? The cement pouring is just a tool in their tool belt.

83
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,720
It's the same thing. We have lots of examples now. Katie Bowman, you know, she did her continuous

84
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,160
high-resolution image reconstruction using PatchPriors, aka the Chirp project. And now

85
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,520
we're able to see a black hole. How cool is that? And that's Python and that's the community.

86
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,920
Right? There's also an art scene that's coming up around Python. This was a commissioned

87
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:58,560
piece of art for our meetup. There you go. Beautiful is better than ugly. 801 is our

88
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,280
little area code. There's a little snake. And this was commissioned art. And this is

89
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,440
a shout out to at dead binky on Twitter and Instagram. She does a lot of work involving

90
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:17,440
So we just had to have her do our T-shirt logo. And the other thing, Python's awesome.

91
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,960
And Pythonistas are awe-inspiring. So the people part, that's the hard part. And that's

92
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,560
what your job as the organizer is, is to make sure that Python keeps going. So to do that,

93
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,360
you have to make sure that humans keep going. And Python wouldn't be the language today

94
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,080
if it wasn't for the community. We said that enough. So one thing that people have, I feel

95
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,080
like people have started to forget in this age of social everything all the time, like

96
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,440
I'm literally getting a notification because I forgot to mute it before the talk. Software

97
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,480
is for people, right? It's for people, not computers. And you probably are going to hear

98
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,480
this a number of times at this conference. When we're thinking about software for people,

99
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,920
this is how you can get that exchange of a diverse set of ideas. And now you get to orchestrate

100
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:15,960
a community experience. Now, what's a community experience? It's any gathering of people.

101
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,280
And all of you pretty much have taken place in a community experience of PyCon. But what

102
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,120
are some other ones? Airports, rodeos, you've all been to a rodeo, right? Well, you should

103
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,720
go to a rodeo, okay? And PyCon, of course. This is a community experience. And what you

104
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,180
should take from that is that your meetup is just a small-scale PyCon. It's just a small-scale

105
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:43,620
community experience that you get to facilitate. And remember, community defines Python. So

106
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,700
how do you run a successful meetup given all that? First thing you're going to do is you're

107
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:55,700
going to go to meetups or go to PyCon. And guess what? You're already here. Isn't that

108
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,820
great? So now what you need to do is absorb your experience. Seriously, it's just like

109
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,580
how when you practice the same thing over and over without trying to improve, without

110
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,740
studying what you're getting wrong, you're never going to do well with that. So what

111
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,420
you have to do at this PyCon, if you want to start your own meetup, absorb your experience

112
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:20,380
right now. For example, I'm a speaker, right? But before I came up here, I was coached by

113
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:27,620
our awesome session chair over here. And this is the result of a lot of people coming together.

114
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,560
We have our cameraman, we have our sound, we have somebody interpreting the words coming

115
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,240
out of my mouth right now. Thank you very much. And you should think about what's your

116
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,440
favorite experience at PyCon and what do you want to copy from that? And you're going to

117
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:49,440
copy it because that's what we do. We copy that experience and we make it better. And

118
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,200
isn't that all we do with code? I mean, who copies code from GitHub? Come on. Yeah. Or

119
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,400
Stack Overflow. It's the same thing. You're going to be doing the same thing but with

120
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:08,920
a community experience. Now, I'm going to give you a bunch of advice right now that

121
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,320
are my personal advice that I think makes a successful meetup and will keep that meetup

122
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,720
going. So the first one would be you want to keep a consistent date. Okay? You're going

123
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,640
to start with no more than one meetup a month and be sure it's at the same time every month.

124
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,840
So for example, it should be one sentence. Salt Lake City Python meets on the first Wednesday

125
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:35,400
of each month at the University of Utah. Great. That's your one sentence pitch to everybody.

126
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,040
And this is my chance, even though this is a very, you know, it's a softer, less technical

127
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,640
talk, I'm going to do some live Python right here. Yeah. So the date utility library learned

128
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:51,280
a lot about this at the tutorial. Render that. And there we go. So this is how you would

129
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,680
interpret in Python when our meetup group meets. I just thought I'd nerd out a little

130
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,680
bit with everybody and with my people. Venue. So venue is one of the trickiest things that

131
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,520
you're going to need if you're going to have a successful meetup. This is probably one

132
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,000
of those hard problems that you don't think about until you realize that a meetup is like

133
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,160
a fourth dimensional space and, oh, I need a time and a place. It can be really hard

134
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:23,080
to get. So here's some ideas. First one that everybody seems to forget about in our field

135
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:29,480
for whatever reason is your local library. Okay. Libraries. Who's been to a library in

136
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,040
the last three years? Okay. Okay. I'm digging it. Just with my people. But what I'm saying

137
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,920
is that libraries, they're not just about, you know, books anymore. They have 3D printers.

138
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,320
Ours has a telescope checkout system. So you can literally check out a telescope. They

139
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,240
have lessons for kids. Lots of summer coding camps for kids now. And you can involve yourself

140
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,720
in that. That's just one more community experience that you get to enrich it. Your local college

141
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,280
or university. We were very lucky to have the University of Utah actually reach out

142
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:06,520
to us and offer a space every month. Another potential one is to reach out to local companies

143
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:14,060
with the intention of maintaining that consistent location. So for example, there's the new

144
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:19,420
startups that are always going on. We have a data engineering meetup in Salt Lake City.

145
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,860
And they decided we're going to be based out of Pluralsight. It's a consistent location.

146
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:30,600
Great for their venue. And it works. Another one is the WeWork community associate or community

147
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,580
lead of hospitality. And here's the disclaimer, though. There's no WeWorks in Salt Lake City

148
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,060
yet. So I've never run one out of there. But I know that WeWork is pushing this. So this

149
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,900
might be a nice ticket in. If there's a WeWork next to you, go talk to their community associate

150
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,340
or community lead of hospitality. They'll give you some good advice on that. So the

151
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,460
next thing you're going to need is somebody like me who can just talk, apparently. You're

152
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,360
going to need presenters. By the way, this is Ken Myers. This is one of the individuals

153
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,340
who is sitting on the Django toolbar. He focuses more on ETL and database stuff. But he was

154
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:12,100
still able to give a really good talk about data modeling in Python. And to find those

155
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,660
speakers, you need to realize every meetup that you host, it's an opportunity to find

156
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:22,260
those speakers. You need to encourage your members to step up and try giving a talk.

157
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:27,300
I didn't just come to PyCon all of a sudden. I've been giving talks at my meetup and other

158
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,780
meetups. And it's the same with most of the speakers here. They started at a meetup. Okay?

159
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,660
The last point, you're likely going to be the first speaker at your meetup. Sorry, not

160
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,460
sorry, because it is a fun experience to do that. But at the same time, it can be a little

161
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:47,540
bit intimidating. Next point, sponsorship and money. This is something that I didn't

162
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:53,240
realize would actually be kind of important to keep track of, who would have known. Running

163
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,640
a good meetup is the key to getting that sponsorship. If you run a good meetup, that sponsorship's

164
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:05,080
easy. I have three guidelines for this. And it's going to solve 99% of your issues. The

165
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,560
first one is you're going to want to make sure that you have a specified time slot for

166
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,040
your sponsors. Because they're going to want to take over the meetup, whether it's a recruiter

167
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,040
or something. We all love recruiter calls, don't we? Recruiter emails. No, nobody loves

168
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,560
those. So what you're going to want to do is make sure that you tell them the rules.

169
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,640
You tell them, hey, we're going to give you three minutes to do a spiel. Don't let them

170
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,960
dominate the conversation. And use open accounting. This is our open accounting right here. If

171
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,600
you go to meetup.com, slash SLC Python, slash money right now, you can see all of our accounting

172
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,920
up through February. Yeah, I fell behind on this because I was working on this talk. But

173
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,800
that's where it is, all of the accountings on the books. On top of that, I'm happy to

174
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,920
report, I didn't know this until a couple days ago, because I have some awesome members

175
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,240
working on it. As of Monday, we're a 501C3. So that's where you can get, if you keep track

176
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:03,000
of the money right, yeah, thank you. This gentleman over here. Another thing, most important

177
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,480
thing is you need to be human. We're all bags of meat trying to make our way through this

178
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,880
world. Get rid of that robot side of you for just a second and realize this one thing.

179
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:20,880
A good tech meetup, it's 20% tech and 80% networking. Another thing you'll need to do in order to

180
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,720
remember that, keep going to other meetups. This is something I personally neglected to

181
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,560
do when I first started. Just a little bit burned out by trying to maintain a brand new

182
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,640
Salt Lake City Python meetup. We went from 80 members to 2,500 members in the course

183
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,200
of five years. So yeah, you can get a little burned out. But at the same time, there's

184
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,200
some other meetups that you can check out. They don't have to be tech meetups. There

185
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,080
was a skeptic society meetup that I found fascinating. Different group of people, different

186
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,200
format. But I still got some ideas and I was able to port them into our meetup. One

187
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:01,400
thing, another thing, there's lots of things I'm talking about today. Never ever forget

188
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,960
that everybody starts out with the ability to use tech. Okay? One thing that's amazing

189
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,520
about this community, the tech community, it's their passes, race, gender, creed, it

190
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,800
welcomes everybody. And we know this. We're at PyCon. But make sure that your meetup is

191
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,200
also an example of this. Make sure that your meetup is a place where somebody can become

192
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:26,200
a better human being. So given all this, what's a basic agenda look like? An agenda is key

193
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,680
to a good meetup. It looks kind of like this. So here's a link. For some reason, bit.ly

194
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,720
didn't work for me today. So the link's up here. I also linked these, I pinned these

195
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,800
slides to my Twitter profile. So we can catch those later. But let's go through our meetup

196
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:48,160
agenda. So first thing I like to do is we do our networking and pizza. This is a great

197
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:55,240
time to introduce yourself to new members and introduce them to other members. While

198
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,840
you're doing these intros and sponsors, you're going to talk about other local meetups. Because,

199
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:05,840
again, you're trying to get that network effect going. This is also a chance to do a, this

200
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:12,320
is also a chance for your sponsors to have their plug. And you can give their spiel for

201
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,720
example, X missions, our local friendly, organic ISP. They've been sponsoring us for the last

202
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,680
two years. So we always give them a quick shout out. And it's just like that. There's

203
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,160
their shout out. And that's the next thing you're going to want to do while you're doing

204
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,240
introductions. You're going to be looking at who's hiring. This is another opportunity.

205
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,760
Once you start this meetup, you're going to get a lot of meetup.com messages. And take

206
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:43,000
that opportunity to say come to the meetup. That's where you can start advertising for

207
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,760
jobs. Things like that. Again, this is just a slice of PyCon. We're just taking that slice

208
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,640
of PyCon. We have a job fair coming up Sunday. So we have our job fair on Sunday. It's the

209
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,600
same thing. We're just taking a slice of something that works. Put it in your meetup. Next thing,

210
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,420
who's looking? This is a great opportunity to get those Pythonistas to give their spiel

211
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:11,140
about themselves. One kudos that I like about our tech community in Utah, we tend to have

212
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:17,740
more people who are hiring than looking, which is phenomenal. And then you talk about community

213
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:22,460
news. So for example, you can talk about local community news. This isn't actually happening.

214
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,780
Guto's not coming to Utah. That would be awesome if he was. But it's just an example. And then

215
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,780
you can talk about global community news like Python 4. This is happening. No, I'm just

216
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,780
kidding. It's not happening either. Again, both of this is fake news. So much fake news.

217
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,940
Talks. Again, this is just PyCon but smaller. There's some differences, though. What you're

218
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,660
going to need to do is you're going to have to give that first talk, as I said. And I

219
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:53,180
believe in you in giving this talk. And you're also going to make sure that your first talk

220
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:58,500
is a beginner talk. So what we've changed formats in the last 18 months, where our first

221
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:04,540
15 to 20 minutes, myself or one of my colleagues, we'll just sit and answer general Python questions.

222
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,540
We'll show you how to install VS code and Anaconda and things like that. Because we

223
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:14,780
have a lot of Windows users. I'm just a Mac user. But I used to be a Mac user. Sorry.

224
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:20,820
I'm a Linux user. And we have a lot of Windows users. And I could never answer for them,

225
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,540
how do they get started? How do they learn Python? I said, well, let's just do a beginner

226
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,220
talk. And we'd work through that stuff. Your members' first talks, you're going to coach

227
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:35,020
those. So once they say, hey, I'm going to be your speaker for June 3rd or whatever the

228
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:40,340
next meetup is, keep in touch with them. Touch base with them every weekend to make sure

229
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:45,980
that they know that, yeah, this stuff's hard. But this is what they can improve on with

230
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:51,180
their slides. This is some other things that people have talked about. And it'll come easy.

231
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,380
Another piece of advice that I like to give to everybody, take a chance to record and

232
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:02,060
stream your meetups as soon as you can. We neglected to do this for our first year. So

233
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:08,340
this is a lesson that we learned. And in retrospect, it would have been very handy to be able to

234
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:13,940
interact with more than just our local tech community. Another example of why this is

235
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,660
important, Nina, who is going to be our keynote speaker, she actually did one of her first

236
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:25,580
talks at our little meetup. OBS is a great program for this, by the way, OBSproject.com.

237
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:30,580
If you don't know how to use OBS, just find any 12-year-old who likes to stream Fortnite

238
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:36,820
and they will teach you how to run OBS for your meetup. Next thing that we do, well,

239
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:42,420
at the very end, after the talks, is we'll do raffle prizes. So here's an orange pie.

240
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,100
An orange pie, it's just like a raspberry pie, but you can buy more than three of them

241
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:53,060
online. So that's pretty awesome. Next thing, this isn't part of the agenda, but this is

242
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,380
something that we do every year. Once a year, we need to come through and celebrate your

243
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,180
members and their community. What's really great about this is it's a good opportunity

244
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,900
to do fundraising, to do network building, but also it's an opportunity for your meetup

245
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,180
members to bring their spouses, people who normally wouldn't go to a technical meetup,

246
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,660
and realize, oh, this is what you've been doing every month? Like, what is this? It's

247
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:21,220
just a lot of cake. And yes, there's a lot of cake during our S4As. So this is our very

248
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,900
first one. This is last minute, can you tell? It was a cookie that had some whipped cream

249
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:31,140
slapped on top. This is our first year anniversary, and, you know, as the years go by, our cake

250
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:37,820
gets better and better. And for some reason, I'm missing all my other cake slides, but

251
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:43,980
that's okay. Yeah, and that's what I was going to talk about with that. Another place, as

252
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,500
I said before when I started this talk, we're going to have an open space at PyCon right

253
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:55,540
after this talk for more involved questions. I want to hear from you what's working. It's

254
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:02,620
going to be room 16 at 16 o'clock. And there's some more resources and inspiration. This

255
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:08,820
is the Python wiki on starting your users group. I've taken some advice on that. I've

256
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,460
tweaked a bit of the advice on that because I found it didn't work. But it's another good

257
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:20,180
start, another good place to look. I'm nearing the end of my talk now. Let's give a special

258
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:25,540
thanks, though. This is Dylan on the left. So he's run the last two meetups. So I think

259
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,420
what I'm talking about kind of works if he was able to take this and keep our meetup

260
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:35,700
going, even though I'm at PyCon this year. I can't count the number of times that Dylan

261
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:42,140
has also stepped up and given a talk when one of our speakers just dropped or we didn't

262
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:49,780
have enough to speak about that meetup. And, yeah, so thank you, Dylan. And we can do an

263
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,500
AMA perhaps in the hallway. How are we on time? By the way, my clock just stopped on

264
00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:01,620
this thing. So seven minutes? Okay. Yeah, we'll do an AMA after this. But one thing

265
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:06,820
real quick, if you're ever in Salt Lake City, I encourage you, be my guest. Please come

266
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:12,700
to a meetup. Meetup.com slash SLC Python. We're more than happy to have you. And thank

267
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:21,460
you for coming here and listening and trying to improve the Python community. And I'm more

268
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,500
than happy to answer some questions at the microphone if somebody had some.

269
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:30,740
Five minutes for questions. So please step up to the audience microphones if you have

270
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:39,420
any questions. Hi. Hello. So great talk. Thank you. I had a question about platform for how

271
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,860
you organize these things. Everyone seems to use meetup.com, which is a really handy

272
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,260
site. But it's not the only game in town. And I know that there's another site called

273
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:53,580
get together.community, I believe, which is meant to be like an open, federated version

274
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,180
of meetup. I don't know if there are other options out there as well. Do you know anything

275
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:02,140
about this? And do you have any thoughts about alternate platforms? So again, I'm speaking

276
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:07,140
for myself because technically I'm an employee of the same ones as meetup. I personally have

277
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:12,180
enjoyed using meetup because it's been around since forever. I mean, I used meetup before

278
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:19,300
So that's why I knew about meetup. Facebook is another place to go, but I don't have an

279
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:25,260
account and a lot of people don't. I don't know about what was the...

280
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:29,140
Get together dot community. Get together dot community. I will need to check that out.

281
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,380
No, platform-wise, meetup, the number one feature I like as an organizer is it gives

282
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,700
you some tools to grow, gives you ways to print name tags, and it lets you do open accounting,

283
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,180
which is just a killer feature for me. But if get together has that, I'll definitely

284
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:50,180
check it out. Thanks for the question. Sure. Are there other questions? Oh.

285
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:57,180
Do you have any resources on establishing a code of conduct for a new meetup?

286
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,740
That's a good question. So the question was, are there any thoughts or resources for establishing

287
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,820
a code of conduct? To which the answer is, we literally link the Python code of conduct.

288
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,900
We say you follow this one and you're good. When it comes to enforcement of that code

289
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:16,580
of conduct, we've only had to do enforcement action once, and in that case, it was just

290
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:22,180
a conversation the next day. Literally, I bought the guy lunch. I went through, hey,

291
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:26,260
what you said to this person, it can be misconstrued. I'm going to ask that you don't go to this

292
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:31,420
meetup for the next one, but after that, things worked out. So that's what we do, is we follow

293
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,620
the Python code of conduct. But that's an excellent question. Yes?

294
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,820
Thanks. Appreciate the talk. I was wondering if you could comment on finding presenters

295
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:47,100
and the challenges there, because that seems to be one of the big challenges as a person

296
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,460
organizing conferences. And another question, as you're organizing this, a lot of people

297
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:58,020
organizing this, would it be valuable to have a space where people who organize meetups

298
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:05,020
could get together virtually to share stories or even like an onboarding process to be a

299
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,700
meetup leader? So your second point is a fantastic idea,

300
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,100
I have to say. Perhaps after this, we can look into making a Slack group or something,

301
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,940
because Slack is literally here, so we can just beg them for a free workspace or something.

302
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:23,340
To your first point, finding presenters is difficult. A lot of the time, they will end

303
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:29,500
up coming to you as you get going, but that initial hurdle, it's tricky. A lot of my initial

304
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,940
presenters were coworkers and people I knew from other meetups. So that's why I encourage

305
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,380
you to go to other meetups before you get started. This gentleman over here, and then

306
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:45,780
we'll go back. Is this on? Yeah. So sponsors for meetups,

307
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:52,260
oftentimes the sponsors want the meetup to be in their space, because it's often a hiring

308
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:58,660
tool and getting people into the space is a huge boon to recruiting. But that kind of

309
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:05,580
consistent location principle. What are your thoughts on that and how have you handled

310
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,060
that when it's come up? So we consider the University of Utah to be

311
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:14,140
a sponsor. We have looked into the fee that they would normally charge for the use of

312
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:20,900
a room, and we just do, in our accounting, we will do plus minus. And we put the University

313
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:27,340
of Utah, they get the same spiel time as anybody else, and we just give them kudos. If the

314
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:32,020
company that is looking to sponsor in their location wants to do more than that, arrange

315
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,940
it ahead of time. But I honestly think that as long as you're focusing on your participants

316
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:41,380
and Pythonistas, the rest will come naturally. Again, this is a rule of thumb. Your mileage

317
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,460
may vary, but that's what's worked for us. Yes?

318
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:51,020
What was like, do you have any big shocks from going as a meetup participant to a meetup

319
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:58,620
especially if you start a meetup from scratch and not take it over from someone else?

320
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:05,620
That's a good question. On Wednesday, I was missing a meetup, and Dylan was really nice,

321
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,780
and he set up a video chat. And what was phenomenal to me, the big shock, was it was the first

322
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:16,060
time I had organized something that didn't rely on me, on one individual. That that community

323
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:20,900
could keep going, and they set up a video chat. So I could keep chatting from a hotel

324
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:27,900
in downtown Cleveland and say, hey, everybody, we got 501c3. Isn't that great news? That

325
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,900
was one of the biggest shocks. That's a good question. Thank you.

326
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:38,900
You mentioned Dylan is your co-organizer. How deep is your bench of co-organizers? I

327
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:46,020
travel a lot. Is that just not suitable for someone who travels a lot to organize a meetup?

328
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,740
Or do you just have a deeper bench and how deep that needs to be?

329
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,340
That's a good question. This year, I've traveled more than I have, I feel like, in my entire

330
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:01,380
life, and Dylan has stepped up. My bench right now is probably there are two people I could

331
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,140
rely on other than myself to run this meetup. But that's a good question. It's something

332
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:13,140
I'll personally need to think about. Hello. What do you find most effective for

333
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:20,140
communicating to the community for turnout, like frequency, initial kind of messaging,

334
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:25,140
like, hey, this meetup is happening, and reminder, we have a meetup tomorrow?

335
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,140
So the most effective one, initially this doesn't work, but the most effective is having

336
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:35,140
that consistent date and time and location. But if you can make sure that your meetup

337
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:40,140
is that slot, the first Wednesday of every month. And the other thing is we accidentally

338
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:45,140
bumped up against the big data user group in Utah is also the first Wednesday. So I

339
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:49,140
don't know, we've been stealing from them, but not intentionally.

340
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,540
I guess what I mean is on messaging, communicating out to the audience. Like, let's say you have

341
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:59,540
an established time, and then where, like, what we do is I communicate out a week before,

342
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,620
I open up the meetup a week before, and then I switch between either two days before or

343
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,620
the day before, remind people, hey, we have a meetup in two days or we have a meetup tomorrow.

344
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:15,500
Okay. We're really lucky. I don't have to do that. There is a Twitter bot in Salt Lake

345
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:21,020
City that will find meetups that are tech, and it will automatically tweet a week before

346
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,460
saying, hey, are you going to this meetup? It's going to be about this. Sometimes it

347
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,500
gets it wrong. Like, this meetup is going to be about the fifth anniversary soiree.

348
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,740
It's like, no, that doesn't make sense. And then it will also tweet the day before. So

349
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,300
a number of our members follow that bot. In addition, whenever we have announcements,

350
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:44,300
I try to every quarter do kind of a state of the meetup email to all of our participants.

351
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,500
Good question. Thank you.

352
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,140
All right. That's all the time we have. Let's give Ferris another round of applause.

353
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,020
Thank you very much.
