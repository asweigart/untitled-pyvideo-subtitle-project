1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,360
Buddy, welcome everybody. We are here with Victor Stinner to

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,760
discuss how to, I lost the title of the talk. We're talking

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,520
about Python contributors for Python projects. Take it away,

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,520
Victor.

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,600
Â» Hi, everybody. I'm Victor Stinner. I'm working for

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,600
Red Hat.

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,840
I'm here to talk about how to engage Python contributors in the

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,840
long term.

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,080
Or say differently, tech is easy, but people are complex.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I hear many people saying that Python is all about code.

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,520
Nope. Liar.

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
I'm here to talk about Python.

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,160
I'm here to begin my journey with an event which happened last

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,160
year for me.

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,160
It was a burnout.

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,080
So, what does it mean, a burnout?

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,080
Last year, I decided to unsubscribe from seven different

19
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,080
Python mailing lists. I also closed all my pull requests.

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,280
I used my filters to ignore all notification coming from Python

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,560
and I decided to do something related to Python. This is

22
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,560
something really huge for me because Python was like, I was

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,560
doing that like all the time and suddenly I stopped to do

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,560
anything related to Python.

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,560
It's like a giant change for me.

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,560
So, I went to the doctor who asked me to stay at home for one

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
month.

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,760
I also decided to stop to work on Python for three months and a

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,760
month and a half, which is, I think, the longest period of no

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
activity from my side on Python.

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,760
To give you an idea of my involvement into Python, this

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
was my typical inbox.

33
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,760
So, you can see that there are many folders like the Python

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,760
billboards, the bug tracker, the mailing list for core

35
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,760
developers, the mentorship mailing list,

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,760
the notification from GitHub, there is also mail and

37
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,760
emails from my customers.

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,760
There is also the security and a mailing list from users.

39
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
So, I was doing many, many different things.

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
And I'm trying to read all my emails at the end of the day.

41
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
So, try to read all emails was more and more difficult for me.

42
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,760
So, what I understood from the burnout is that maybe, maybe

43
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
it's time for me to step back a little bit from Python because

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,760
I'm just doing way too many things and it's not going to be

45
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
fine.

46
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
So, to explain you why I'm doing so many things in Python is

47
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,760
that I didn't decide one day to take all the responsibilities

48
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,760
in Python.

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760
It's more than I decided to pick one more responsibility every

50
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
six months.

51
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
And after a few years, I was just responsible of too many

52
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
things.

53
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,760
And I was working something like 30 hours in average per day

54
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,760
which is way too much for a human.

55
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
But I will not elaborate all reasons for the burnout because

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
it's also something very personal.

57
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
And I prefer to not elaborate here.

58
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
So, I decided to take one more responsibility every six months

59
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,760
because I'm not going to take all the responsibilities.

60
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
So, to come back to the open source, the problem is that I

61
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
don't scale.

62
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
Even if I would like to work more hours per day, it's not

63
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
physically possible.

64
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,760
And I also see an increase of the workload in Python.

65
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
There are more and more things to do in Python in general.

66
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
And there is a decrease of the new core developers per year.

67
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,760
And there is the number of open issues over the last seven

68
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,760
years.

69
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,760
And you can see that it's a straight line.

70
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,760
We are getting more and more open issues.

71
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
It's just increasing.

72
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,760
And to give you an idea of the pull request, today we are over

73
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,760
1,000 open pull requests.

74
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
And almost 7,000 open issues.

75
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,760
And we are getting more and more open issues.

76
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
And we are getting more and more open issues.

77
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,760
So, we are getting more and more open issues.

78
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,760
And we are getting more and more open issues.

79
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
But if you look at the bottom, it's the number of new core

80
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
developers per year.

81
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,760
And you can see that the trend is more and we are getting less.

82
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,760
So, the workload is increasing and the new core developers is

83
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,760
a little bit more.

84
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,760
And also, as you saw, we are getting more and more open issues.

85
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,760
And we are closer to 30.

86
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,760
And I like this comment that I found on the

87
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,760
commit strip.com website.

88
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,760
It shows how people expect that open source is done.

89
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,760
So, what can we see here?

90
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,360
is a manager saying that, oh, I have assigned a team

91
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,520
to blah, blah, blah, which means that even outside

92
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,120
this picture, there is even more resources to do the work.

93
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,360
There is someone bringing coffee.

94
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,800
And we can also expect that they are working during the day.

95
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,800
And you can compare that to the reality.

96
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,240
And this is how open source applications are really

97
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,720
maintained.

98
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,440
So here you have a single person working, obviously,

99
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,960
in the middle of the night.

100
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,880
There is a cat waiting on the couch for these people

101
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,720
to stop working.

102
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,520
And he says, hmm, maybe just one more

103
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,880
ticket before going to bed.

104
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,600
So it means that in practice, open source

105
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,000
is done by volunteers.

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,040
And they are doing that in addition to their work.

107
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,680
You often hear the sentence, we are all volunteers.

108
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,720
And I would like to elaborate the sentence a little bit.

109
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,080
Contributors are giving their free time to Python.

110
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,160
So what is free time?

111
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,840
It means that it can mean evening, weekends, maybe

112
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,200
also part of the night.

113
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,000
And you have to understand that a day

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,280
has a fixed number of hours.

115
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,920
And if you remove the time used to sleep,

116
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,880
you don't have so much time per day.

117
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,760
So each time that you spend off Python,

118
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,160
you are taking it from something else.

119
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,560
So it means that people who would like to contribute

120
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,360
to Python as a contributor have to trade this time

121
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,120
between friends and family on Python.

122
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,040
And sadly, few employers allow their employee

123
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,640
to contribute to Python upstream.

124
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,800
But there are a few of them.

125
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,560
I'm feeling very lucky because I'm working for Red Hat

126
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,040
and I'm paid full time to maintain Python upstream

127
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,720
but also downstream.

128
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,880
So to fix issues in a rel on Fedora.

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,600
From Microsoft, there is Brett Cannon, Barry Warsaw,

130
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,080
Eric Snow, Steve Dower, who have one day per week.

131
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,440
At Dropbox, Guido Van Rossum has more or less

132
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,800
50% of his time on Python.

133
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,520
Kotlsoft, we have Emily Morehouse,

134
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,880
who also have one day per week.

135
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,000
And there are also Neil Shimenowa and Inada Naoki

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
who have also one day per week.

137
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,520
But if you put all these people all together,

138
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,440
at the end you have almost three people,

139
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,920
three developers paid full time.

140
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,800
And honestly, that's not a lot of developers

141
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,640
who are paid to work on Python.

142
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,600
Especially when you compare the popularity of Python.

143
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,680
It's according to the Tire Index,

144
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,400
which is a website which measure the popularity

145
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,920
and usage of programming language,

146
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,560
Python is just the third most popular

147
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,960
world language in the world.

148
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,280
The first complaint about contributors is that

149
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,040
they succeed to produce a pull request

150
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,520
but nobody wants to merge a pull request.

151
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,560
And Brett Cannon found a good explanation for this issue.

152
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,560
Maybe you can think of a contribution like a puppy.

153
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,480
You may view it as this cute, wonderful thing

154
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,920
you are giving me, while I'm looking at it

155
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,400
as an over decayed of feeding, walking on wet bills.

156
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,840
So to explain to you what it means in Python,

157
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,400
is that when I would like to click on the merge button,

158
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,800
if I click on it, I will be responsible for the change code.

159
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,360
So if anyone complains, if there is a regression,

160
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,160
if it's causing more troubles,

161
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,540
I will be the one responsible for this issues.

162
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,200
And sometimes I don't want to get these responsibilities

163
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,860
because I already have enough of them.

164
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,000
We already did some actions in the past

165
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,480
to try to work on this scalability issues.

166
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,760
For example, we now have a developer guide

167
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,200
to explain the workflow, how to create a pull request,

168
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,920
where to find the information.

169
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,760
We migrated from Mercurial to Git on GitHub

170
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,240
and the purpose is to simplify the creation

171
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,040
of the UFORCE pull request,

172
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,940
but also to simplify the workflow.

173
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,560
We now have a CI running on Linux

174
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,320
and another one running on Windows,

175
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,000
which is run when you propose a change.

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,120
And this is really helpful for the core developers

177
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,320
who click on the merge button

178
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,540
because they can be more confident in the change.

179
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,920
But even with all these actions,

180
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,520
the core developers are still the bottleneck of the workflow.

181
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,680
And to explain it differently,

182
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,760
you cannot solve people problem with software.

183
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,440
So now let's see the diversity problems.

184
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,920
First of all, I commonly hear,

185
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,280
oh, there is no complaint about diversity,

186
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,800
so there is no diversity issue.

187
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,320
And Marietta Vigiaia shared a tweet saying that

188
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,440
when women speak out about diversity in the community,

189
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,960
they get penalized, branded as non-technical.

190
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,520
Some women chose not to speak out because of death.

191
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,120
We will not be silenced.

192
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,920
So there are different issues in a community like Python.

193
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,800
It's a set of things that I would call

194
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,520
the toxicity of the community.

195
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,880
For example, when someone proposed a change in Python,

196
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,280
some people, instead of arguing at the technical level,

197
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,720
they tend to attack directly the outer of the proposal.

198
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,520
And this is not a good way to behave on the main list.

199
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,160
And we really have to stay at the technical level,

200
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,280
especially because when you are involved in a project

201
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,280
like Python, it can be difficult to handle this criticism.

202
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,000
And the attacks can be in the public space,

203
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,320
but sometimes it continues in the private space,

204
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,600
and sometimes it even works,

205
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,280
even only happens in the private space,

206
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,920
which means that we are not aware of it

207
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
and we cannot take any action.

208
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,480
And this is also why some people consider

209
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,560
that there is no diversity issue,

210
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,080
is that these issues are hidden.

211
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,080
Toxicity can also be bullying, misogyny, or racism.

212
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,760
To give you a concrete example of the diversity issues,

213
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,080
I noticed that some project decided to get rid

214
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,240
of the master and slave terms

215
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,360
because they are badly connoted as slavery.

216
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,000
And sometimes it's not really appropriate,

217
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,480
not the best term that you can use.

218
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,720
So what I did is to,

219
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,920
my computer is fine.

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What I did is just to replace the terms

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
in only the documentation and in comments.

222
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
For example, I replaced master process with parent process.

223
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,440
And for the networking, I replaced client and master

224
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,120
with client on server.

225
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,960
For the build bot, I replaced build slave

226
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960
with build bot workers,

227
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,920
with build bot workers,

228
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,840
because build slave was the old term,

229
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,600
but in the newer version of build bot,

230
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,280
it's build bot workers.

231
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,600
But I think that the worst term was client slaves,

232
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,920
which has been replaced by helpers.

233
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,040
So a journalist became aware of this change

234
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,880
and decided to write an article about that

235
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,320
on the news website called The Register.

236
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,800
And from that point, many, many other website

237
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,720
decided to discuss this topic.

238
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,240
There were articles in Russia Today,

239
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,040
Breitbart, develop.com, Hacker News,

240
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,160
Motherboard VS, slash.forshan, West China,

241
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,560
Twitter, Weibo, and many others.

242
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,400
And people commented this issue in English,

243
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,480
Russian, Japanese, Chinese, German, French,

244
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,400
Czech, and many other language.

245
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,280
And all these articles mentioned not only my full name,

246
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,600
but also my employer.

247
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,640
And to give you an idea of the volume of the discussion

248
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,360
just on Slashdots in two days,

249
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,800
there were more than 1,200 comments.

250
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,400
And to give you an idea of the quality of the discussion

251
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,120
on how people like this change,

252
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,800
I just chose two examples from Forchan,

253
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,160
which is a website where people are anonymous.

254
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,880
And it says, fuck you, Victor Stienaer,

255
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,960
you are the enemy of Slashdot now, eat shit.

256
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,520
I will probably make a video about this gay shit.

257
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,360
And someone else is even more direct.

258
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,440
I would like him dead.

259
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,160
Okay.

260
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,200
Honestly, I did not expect this violence

261
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,120
and this amount of communication and debate.

262
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,640
I did not expect anything

263
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,400
because it was only a change in Python.

264
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,560
And many people who don't know anything about Python

265
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,520
started to discuss this thing.

266
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,520
But it's just to give you an example of the diversity issues.

267
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,780
Okay, we saw the problems, so let's see the solutions.

268
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,120
First of all, as I said, it's not a technical issue,

269
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,600
it's a human issue.

270
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,920
So you need a different tool.

271
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,120
You cannot use a debugger,

272
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,200
but what you can do is, for example, psychology.

273
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,480
And there is something called the unconscious biases.

274
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,040
They are social stereotypes about certain group of people

275
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,720
that individuals forms outside their mind

276
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,720
outside their own conscious awareness.

277
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,520
So it's a little bit tricky to understand it,

278
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,960
but the key point is that there are biases

279
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,680
and you are not aware of them.

280
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,920
It means that even if you are trying to not be racist,

281
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,840
to not have stereotypes, you still have stereotypes.

282
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,200
And I found a good example to explain you that

283
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,160
today we have more and more machine learning

284
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,440
and some people decided to apply machine learning

285
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,540
to the justice to help to take decision.

286
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,120
And a study has been made on the machine learning

287
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,440
used to predict future crime.

288
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,880
And the study says that the machine learning

289
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,040
is biased against black people.

290
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,560
So this is just one example of two people

291
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,200
who have been arrested because they possessed drug.

292
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,800
And the white person got a score of three,

293
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,440
which is low risk.

294
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,400
And the black person got a score of 10, which is high risk.

295
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,240
But the machine learning failed

296
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,280
because the white person has been arrested three more times

297
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,160
and the black person has not been arrested after that.

298
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,840
And machine learning, to try to simplify

299
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,840
as much as possible, you have data, you have the training,

300
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,020
and from that you get prediction.

301
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,840
So if the prediction is racist,

302
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,800
maybe the issue is coming from your input data.

303
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,360
And what I'm trying to say is that thanks to software,

304
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,760
we can look at ourself inside a mirror

305
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,000
and we can see that we are racist.

306
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,200
It's part of us.

307
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,200
It's just that the software is telling us that we are racist.

308
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,080
Something else which is helpful to understand

309
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,440
the human relationship and how people behave

310
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,120
is called the imposter syndrome.

311
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,160
It's a psychological pattern in which an individual

312
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,120
doubts their accomplishments

313
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,880
and has a persistent internalized fear

314
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,000
of being exposed as a fraud.

315
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,960
So again, it's not really easy to understand what it means.

316
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,440
To explain it differently, I would say that you consider

317
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
that you don't deserve what you get.

318
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,440
And I think a good example of the imposter syndrome

319
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,120
is that nowadays more and more people

320
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,120
are using the social media, social networks.

321
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,240
And the thing is that when you go to these websites,

322
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,040
people are only sharing the best of themselves.

323
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,040
They try to share photos of their latest amazing travel,

324
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,120
of their beautiful children, of their children,

325
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,240
of their funny pictures of cats.

326
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,360
And when you look at all of this, slowly you consider

327
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,680
that your life is less interesting

328
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,520
than the life of your friends

329
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,760
because you compare your life to the life

330
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,440
of people using the social media.

331
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,680
And because of that, some therapists started to say

332
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,080
that the social media are making us more depressed.

333
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,960
And the thing is that this is one example

334
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,000
of the imposter syndrome because you consider

335
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,080
that your life is less interesting.

336
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,840
It's just because social media are designed

337
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,880
to make people only share the best of themselves

338
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,680
to only share the positive message.

339
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,400
When someone is sick in your family,

340
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,080
if you get a very boring day,

341
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,280
nobody shares this kind of information

342
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,000
because it's boring.

343
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,000
And I think that we can also make the parallel with work

344
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,600
because it's common that as war people just show

345
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,440
the best of themselves and they try to hide their defects

346
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,040
just because we want to get a promotion,

347
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,680
we want to show that we are very good at what we are doing.

348
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,960
But when you compare yourself to your peers,

349
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,600
you consider that your work is less valuable

350
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,720
just because of that.

351
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,200
Now let's talk about the code of conduct.

352
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,720
So at the beginning, there was no code of conduct.

353
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,800
And it was fine at the beginning

354
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,360
because Python was quite small with a few people,

355
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,600
but slowly Python becomes more and more popular

356
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,640
and we started to see some conflicts between people.

357
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,320
And we say that maybe we need some kind of agreements

358
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,600
of what is a good behavior

359
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,320
and what is an inappropriate behavior.

360
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,120
So code of conduct has been created

361
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,520
and first it has been applied on the mailing list

362
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,880
to continue with the bug tracker and also the websites.

363
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,040
Now the code of conduct is also applied to conferences

364
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,480
like back in US.

365
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,640
And last year, the back in US even used the service

366
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,640
of a company to help to manage code of conduct incidents

367
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,200
because the worst thing that you want to get

368
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,800
in case of code of conduct incidents

369
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,480
is to make the event even worse.

370
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,640
So you have to be able to understand what is the issue,

371
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,280
how to provide the best action

372
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,440
and to be able to react quickly.

373
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,200
So this is not something that we are used to do

374
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,280
and we need some training for that.

375
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,440
And by the way, the Python Software Foundation

376
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,040
even requires a code of conduct

377
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,040
for all conferences called PyCon.

378
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,120
And now the discussion is more about

379
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,160
how to handle incidents and bans

380
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,840
to be blocked on our community.

381
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,720
Some people propose to maybe write down some rules,

382
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,400
but it's a little bit tricky to agree on that.

383
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,160
To come back to the diversity,

384
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,520
the diversity means different things.

385
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,880
And for example, you can see that

386
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,120
as a diversity of point of view

387
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,000
because in Python some people cares more

388
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,040
about the documentation,

389
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,920
some others about the reference counting in C

390
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,800
or the backward compatibility,

391
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,400
the API, the language consistency,

392
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,560
ability to find the simplest solution,

393
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,680
to care about corner cases,

394
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,520
performance, security,

395
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,520
other Python implementation like PyPy.

396
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,160
And if you take a small group of people

397
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,600
who are only experts on certain area,

398
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,400
maybe Python wouldn't be as good as it is today.

399
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,560
We really need this diversity of point of view

400
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,960
to make Python as good as it can be.

401
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,120
It can also means the diversity of use cases

402
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,840
because some people are using Python

403
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,320
for command line interface.

404
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,240
And in that case, what is important is a startup time.

405
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,880
And some people are using Python

406
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,320
for several running for multiple days.

407
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,480
And here what is important is more the memory usage

408
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,000
because you don't want to have to reboot your server

409
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,680
because it's out of memory.

410
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,680
Some people are using the graphical interfaces

411
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,320
for machine learning, develop rest servers,

412
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,320
games, and many other use cases.

413
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,200
To give you a very concrete example of what I said,

414
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,920
Naoki Inada has been promoted as a core developer

415
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,640
three years ago.

416
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,360
And he has been selected as a BDFL delegate.

417
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,080
So the one to take the decision on a PEP.

418
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,240
For the PEP 538, which is a C local question,

419
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,240
and my PEP 340, which is a UTF-8 mode.

420
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,160
And what we can see is that in fact,

421
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,800
English speakers are just satisfied with ASCII

422
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,800
because it's plenty enough to write

423
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,640
whatever you want in English.

424
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,920
But maybe people from Japan are more used

425
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,520
to Unicode issues.

426
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,900
So it's something which are really bugging them every day.

427
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,220
And for Naoki Inada, it's really important

428
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,100
to make sure that Python is working in all cases

429
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,780
for any kind of encoding.

430
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,640
Okay, now let's see the mentoring.

431
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,140
And I would like to begin with the positive actions.

432
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,700
So three years ago at the SpyCon,

433
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,660
Willow Van Rossum encouraged women

434
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,860
to contact him for mentoring.

435
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,060
And he mentored Marjata Vijaya,

436
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,180
who became the first woman core developer

437
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,340
in January 2017.

438
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,540
And after Marjata, other women have been promoted,

439
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,580
Carol Winning, Lisa Roach,

440
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,860
Emily Morehouse, and Sheryl Sibala.

441
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,780
And you can see that thanks to positive action,

442
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,100
we moved from zero woman core developers

443
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,620
up to five woman core developers.

444
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,520
So it's still not 50-50, but at least it's growing.

445
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,140
And to explain you the mentoring,

446
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,180
I would like to come back to the beginning of my journey

447
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,660
about the burnouts.

448
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,080
I say that I don't care.

449
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,740
So the idea of mentoring is that instead of fixing an issue,

450
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,540
you have to explain it to how to fix it.

451
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,180
Or say differently, give a man a fish

452
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,500
and you feed him for a day.

453
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,080
Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

454
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,760
For example, I mentored Pablo Salgado

455
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,320
between January and June 2018.

456
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,080
And he became a core developer in June.

457
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,540
And usually it's way, way longer to become a core developer.

458
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:44,000
So what I'm trying to say is that thanks to mentoring,

459
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,820
it was possible for him to become a core developer.

460
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,560
Or maybe without mentoring,

461
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,640
he would just move to another project

462
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,220
or stop contributing to Python.

463
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,520
And you have to understand that the development

464
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,920
of an open source project like Python

465
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,480
is really a matter of trust.

466
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,240
To be able to give the keys of Python,

467
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,360
to give the commit bit of Python,

468
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,640
you really need a very, very high level of confidence

469
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,520
in someone you have to trust

470
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,740
as the person that you are promoting.

471
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,560
Python is also about communities.

472
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,300
You have, for example, PyLadies.

473
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,420
And their module is women who love coding in Python.

474
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,020
They are organizing events all around the world.

475
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:40,060
As there are events in Australia, Brazil, France, India,

476
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,620
Netherlands, Nigeria, Taiwan.

477
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,880
And their website is PyLadies.com.

478
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
This is the kind of thing that they do,

479
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,800
is to organize events to teach Python to women.

480
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,840
But you can see in the audience

481
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,960
that it's not only for women, it's also for men.

482
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,200
There is trans or code.

483
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,360
And their module is the event that aims

484
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,640
to help draw attention to transgender issues

485
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,880
through a topic-focused Ag Day.

486
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,560
And for example, the latest events

487
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,280
was PyLondonium at London, UK.

488
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,120
And their website is transcode.github.io.

489
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,680
That's the kind of event that they organize.

490
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,360
It's the creation of the trans.tech,

491
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,460
the previous version of the website.

492
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,880
And I think that the most popular community

493
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,160
is the Django Girls.

494
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,400
And their module is we inspire women

495
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,480
to fall in love with programming.

496
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,480
And I will not give you the full list

497
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,120
because they made a lot of events,

498
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,680
more than 700 events in Cameroon, Finland, France,

499
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,800
Ghana, India, Japan, Spain, Switzerland,

500
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,600
and many other countries.

501
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,720
Their website is DjangoGirl.com.

502
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,040
So you can see that all people enjoy programming,

503
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,520
so it's very successful.

504
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,760
And to conclude,

505
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,880
I would say that we are aware that there is an issue,

506
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,440
and we are aware that the core developers

507
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,240
is a bottleneck of the development of Python.

508
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,240
We are aware that Python has a people issue.

509
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,120
And we saw that the mentoring is efficient

510
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,720
to train contributors of future core developers.

511
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,520
And also that the code of conduct

512
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,840
reduces the toxicity of a community.

513
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,960
According to Grido Van Rossum,

514
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,920
increasing the core's diversity is a very important goal

515
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,560
to ensure the future health of Python.

516
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,000
And I like the quote from Brett Cannon,

517
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,200
also Naomi Seder, which is,

518
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,760
come for the language and stay for the community.

519
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,760
So what's next for the diversity and mentoring?

520
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,160
We are working on a process to promote people,

521
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,200
to make it more, to write down things.

522
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,200
We are working on a mentoring guide

523
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,440
to explain what is mentoring,

524
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,600
how to mentor, what does it mean.

525
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,400
And there is also a work in progress contributor tutorial,

526
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,120
which is a C by Tor,

527
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,920
which is a way to explain what is a mentor.

528
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,920
Tutorial, which is a C by Tor.score.tutorial.readthedoc.io.

529
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,200
And that's it, thank you.

530
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,200
So he'll be taking questions out in the hallway

531
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,040
and give it up again for Victor, yeah.
