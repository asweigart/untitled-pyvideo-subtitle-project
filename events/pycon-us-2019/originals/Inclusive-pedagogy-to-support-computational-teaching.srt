1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
All yours Tracy. All right. Well, thank you so much

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:11,200
I am super excited to be here and I really appreciate the opportunity to speak with this group as Meg says

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,220
This is such an amazing crowd of people who are already excited about this

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:22,880
And I think what's really great about the people that are excited about education is that teaching is leadership at the front of the room

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,520
So we have a bunch of teachers and we have a bunch of leaders

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,960
In this group that are interested and excited to make an impact in their communities

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,440
Whoops, okay. So yeah, so this is what I'm going to talk about today and I work with the Carpentries

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,640
But I used to teach swimming

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,600
And so when I taught swimming you actually can learn to teach swimming. It's a 40-hour course through the American Red Cross

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,420
And when we learn to teach swimming, you know walk through there's certain things that everyone needs to know about swimming

11
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,000
Like put your face in the water put your head under the water

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,320
Kick your feet move your arms the kind of core skills are not overwhelmingly complicated

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,060
So what we talk about is how to introduce those skills what order to introduce them how to work with the people

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,680
in the pool adults to children and

15
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,500
So when we talk about learning to swim this is never how we approach it

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,180
Where you walk someone to the edge of the pool and you push them in the deep end, right

17
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,400
Does this person obviously this is not that scenario come back to swimming lessons the next day

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,640
Would we expect that to happen if we took someone who didn't know how to swim and threw them in the deep end?

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,680
probably not

20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:52,120
Instead what we're taught is that we want to support people in their learning

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,360
We want to be there with them. We want to provide guidance. We want to introduce things at an appropriate level

22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,760
But yet somehow when we move into the computational realm

23
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,440
We forget some of these things that we know about learning

24
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:15,760
And we sort of throw people in the deep end not because we think that that's

25
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,120
What we should do necessarily, but maybe we've forgotten what it was like to learn to swim what the deep end looks like

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,440
Maybe we don't know how to introduce things in the right order how to create the environment for our learners

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,800
And so in swimming we're really motivated to do it

28
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,000
This way rather than the other way because actual drowning has a lot of bad implications

29
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,720
It's not quite as obvious when we're teaching someone coding

30
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,800
So what we see is that how we teach is as important as what we teach

31
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,600
right same things in swimming, but one person is never getting in the water again and

32
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,360
another person can go through the steps to learn to swim and

33
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,720
So we talked about bringing compute to data

34
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,400
Maybe in this conference will have a lot of that compute to data or data to compute

35
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,360
But what we need to do is we need to bring people to data and to software

36
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:23,280
Because we want to empower all people culturally and linguistically diverse students to use data in software to answer

37
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,000
Questions that are important to them by having more people who have these skills and these perspectives

38
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,280
We have more opportunity to answer questions in science and society and for these people themselves

39
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,920
Most of all to feel empowered to do the things that they want to do and I took Meg's statement here

40
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
I like the access counts

41
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:50,320
Right access for everyone to be able to learn these things is important and when we're thinking about that framework

42
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,920
And this is what Meg was saying too. It's really important that we consider how we teach if we want to bring these to everybody

43
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,160
So I'm going to be talking about

44
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,640
Some of these elements from the perspective of the Carpentries the Carpentries is a nonprofit organization

45
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,720
And we're an open global community teaching researchers and librarians

46
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:17,720
The skills and perspectives to turn data into knowledge and we do this through our curriculum our instructor training program and our community

47
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,560
And so what we realized in the Carpentries we started out teaching the skills of the Carpentries

48
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,520
and skills and

49
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,360
more we taught the more we realized that the most important thing to select for is

50
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,600
confidence and self-efficacy

51
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,920
Do we teach short format workshops two days in two days?

52
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,200
We're not necessarily going to be able to see we definitely can't teach everything

53
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,400
But at the end of the two days is not as important if you know exactly how to write a line of syntax

54
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,360
Then if it's you have now the confidence to continue learning that you have some ability to keep learning yourself

55
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,360
That's the thing that's going to keep you going on your exciting coding path

56
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,040
and

57
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,320
So what's really great is in having this mentality?

58
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,040
There's already a lot of work done in this space and educational pedagogy and culturally responsive

59
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:18,240
Teaching that can help guide our practices so when I talk about the things that we're doing these are things that come from

60
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,400
From the literature from research that can help guide our practices so we still have more to learn

61
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,080
But this is where we are right now. So these are two great resources. I would highly recommend both of these books

62
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:40,540
And the other amazing thing is that in the Carpentries we have about 2,000 volunteer instructors

63
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,980
And so these instructors to are contributing to all the ideas that I'm going to talk about today

64
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:54,180
Through their teaching through their learning they're contributing to our instructor training to our materials talking to each other in the community

65
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,700
So we have a really rich resource that contributes to these ideas and people passionate about teaching people

66
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,580
and learning coding skills and

67
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,380
So all of this is incorporated into our instructor training program

68
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,860
It's also a two-day program that highlights a lot of these things that I'm going to talk about

69
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:20,780
And all is this is all open source or CC by so you can check out our materials to and if it's some of these things

70
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,780
seem interesting

71
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,780
Okay, so I'm going to focus on when I talk about how we teach three

72
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,740
Sort of concepts and then some of the things that we do within each of these concepts

73
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,860
So the first is creating the classroom community

74
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,900
the second is talking about productive struggle and

75
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,060
Then finally assessment for learning

76
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:51,980
So creating the classroom community or a container for learning so sometimes you hear the phrase we need to create the container for learning

77
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:58,460
What space is someone walking into where they're going to learn so if someone is walking in feeling insecure?

78
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:04,340
Maybe the first way they learned it is being pushed in the deep end of the pool if that's how they're feeling you need to create

79
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,020
A space where they can feel safe to learn to try to fail

80
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,820
So every person needs a place that is furnished with hope you want people to be hopeful when they walk in that room

81
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:23,700
Okay, so just as an example so who in this room has been in a course or workshop where they felt like they didn't belong

82
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,780
And then how many people then left that topic for a while or maybe even forever

83
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
So

84
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,020
That space that sense of belonging

85
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:44,180
Impacts that content you can think to yourself if you've now come back to that subject is it because you were incapable

86
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,120
Or was it because it was your first that your first experience with that topic

87
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:55,320
So how we are taught has such an impact on what it is we decide that we can learn

88
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,560
So what do we do in the carpentries to create this classroom community

89
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,360
So I'm just going to highlight five things and so the first

90
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,600
Introductions is connecting with your learners so

91
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,080
When you're creating this space the learner wants to know that they can trust you that they're you're an advocate for them

92
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,360
So we have a whole sort of introductions to introduction

93
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,800
So how you'd introduce yourself as an instructor has a big impact

94
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:33,440
And I'll do a quick example so I could introduce myself two different ways to this group or let's say your classroom

95
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,720
I could say hi. My name is Tracy. I've been working in bioinformatics for 20 years

96
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,640
My favorite thing to do is work out the Linux command line and computers are awesome. So let's go

97
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,840
Do you feel like I'm gonna connect with you necessarily or I could say hi

98
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,200
My name is Tracy. I've been working in biology for 20 years

99
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,480
I've been able to use some computational approaches and I really was exciting what I what that let me do

100
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,080
And I'm really excited to be here today to share some of those skills with you and so that we can all work together

101
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,320
to learn

102
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
computational approaches in biology

103
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,760
Which one thinks has you thinking that I'm on your side, right? So it does start the second

104
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,760
I hope maybe the first

105
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,280
Depends on the audience, right? So that's something to know right? Who's your audience?

106
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,040
What's gonna help you connect with them? What part of your experience?

107
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,920
It's gonna help you connect with them

108
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,040
And I think that's actually a really great and amazing thing about being a teacher is that you bring your whole self

109
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,160
To that teaching makes you a better teacher

110
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,960
So sharing that parts those parts of you can be really powerful

111
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,120
Our code of conduct so Carpentries has a code of conduct and enforcement guidelines

112
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,440
So we always share that upfront that we have a code that we have certain

113
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,040
Expectations for how the teacher is going to interact with the students and how the students should interact with each other

114
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,520
And then we make those expectations clear

115
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,240
We also give the students an opportunity to connect with each other

116
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,040
This isn't just a dynamic between the person at the front of the room

117
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,760
And the people sitting there

118
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,880
It's a dynamic between the students as well, so we say we don't like a quiet classroom

119
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,880
We like the students learning from each other

120
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,480
Partly because they can see each other struggle a little bit

121
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,000
But they can learn from each other and they can teach each other

122
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,080
Sometimes they may think they don't know something but they actually teach the person next to them

123
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:35,400
So we have students just take a minute and introduce themselves to each other and just you say

124
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,360
What's your name?

125
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,320
Describe your research in three words or less and name one thing you're proud of that you made

126
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,840
So it just provides something a little bit interesting

127
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:52,280
That's that's one example for a quick introduction and that makes a really big impact on the feel of the workshop

128
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,840
Accessibility highlighting up front how people can

129
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,680
Accessibility is a very important part of the process

130
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,680
How people can

131
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,720
Access the materials in a variety of different ways

132
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:14,600
So in terms of accessibility, this is a place where we have improvement and it also reminds me that I forgot to turn on the captions

133
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
Here, let's see there

134
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,680
Telling people up front see i'm using the google captions. We're going to see how it goes

135
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:31,160
So but telling people up front how they can access materials instead of having to have people ask for them

136
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,800
Because sometimes people don't necessarily know

137
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,960
that they

138
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:43,960
Have different ways of learning or access challenges and so being up front with the way different ways that people can access the materials is important

139
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,200
and then finally setting expectations for learning so

140
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,920
We're going to be in this course

141
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,120
You're going to be learning a lot of new things things are going to be challenging. You might not get it right the first time

142
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,280
That's okay. We're working through this together. Here's where we're starting

143
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,440
Here's where we're going to end up

144
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,120
So it's not a mystery around what you're going to learn and also setting the stage for the idea that you know

145
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,120
That they're going to struggle and that that's expected and that's part of the learning

146
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,480
Okay, so

147
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,080
Productive struggle so we're in the workshop. Everyone's excited to be there

148
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:28,360
And so this I think I can a lot of people that walk into training around coding are disempowered

149
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,680
They feel like it's something they can't do

150
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,920
So it might be that we're not rebuilding we're just building in the first place

151
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,120
But a lot of times I am talking sorry about adult learners throughout this rebuilding that

152
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:48,680
I think I can attitude begins with helping the students achieve small incremental success on important tasks and both of those things are important

153
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:56,680
success as small successes and important tasks if people are having successes on things they view as toy problems

154
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
They don't feel as accomplished

155
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:06,680
So how do we embrace productive struggle in our workshop first in that introduction by saying you're going to struggle?

156
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,520
But we have the active learning so you have to try it

157
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,880
As a part of the struggle you can't just hear it

158
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:21,720
Like also in swimming you don't teach swimming by having everyone sit on the pool deck and show them a powerpoint presentation

159
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,800
Right that would not be very effective

160
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,260
So same thing here get them in the pool get them in their computer

161
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,000
And so when we teach when we're at the front of the room

162
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,040
The instructor is coding and the students are coding along with the instructor

163
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,560
And so it gives people an opportunity to try things out together. So we're not just showing

164
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,120
We're working together

165
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:50,120
We use an I we you model of teaching so I introduce the topic

166
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,720
We work on it together and then you try it on your own

167
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,520
So again that has that incremental element to it where you see it

168
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,040
Then we do it together and then you get to try it on your own

169
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,520
and

170
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:10,840
Also meg highlighted this as well reframing mistakes as learning so we say the mistakes are the pedagogy

171
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,160
So when you're the instructor at the front of the room and you're live coding you make mistakes

172
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
so many mistakes

173
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,080
And um, so it's a real opportunity one to show that you are human and that you make mistakes, right?

174
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,640
And it's also an opportunity to show how you recover from those mistakes

175
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,640
So we want people to be able to learn how to recover

176
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,720
And so the mistakes are the learning for the instructor at the front of the room when they tell you that you forgot

177
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,800
Whatever it is. You forgot

178
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,520
Or type the same thing wrong for the third time

179
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:52,040
Um, but they themselves have that process of seeing where they make a mistake and using that to learn

180
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
Rather than thinking of it as a failure

181
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,840
Um relevant examples, so in software carpentry data carpentry library carpentry

182
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,120
We are primarily working with researchers in librarians

183
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,080
And so all of the examples that we use are relevant to the people's research

184
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,360
Context so they're working with a system. They're already familiar with so they already have a

185
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,080
Framework that they're interested in and understand and so the examples come from that

186
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,240
So they're building coding onto a framework that they already have and then it's also

187
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:29,820
Motivational because those are problems that they want to solve they want to go back to their lab back to their library

188
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:36,120
And solve those problems. Um, and so using relevant examples helps them feel it is productive

189
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,600
They're doing something that they would do in their daily work

190
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,880
And then finally immediate feedback and help

191
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,120
So struggling on your own is not very valuable

192
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,720
You do need that someone to be able to step in and say oh here, you know

193
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,440
Here's where we could do something differently. So it does need to be immediate

194
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,840
And so in all of our workshops, we have two instructors and then we have helpers in our workshop

195
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,840
So we have about a five to one ratio

196
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,420
So the helpers can come and help people individually when they're struggling with challenges

197
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,420
So

198
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:17,260
Finally assessment for learning so often we think about assessment as sort of taking a test and it's very stressful

199
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,620
But we actually can use assessment as a way to think about learning

200
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:30,940
And so our favorite version of format assessment is formative assessment. So assessment during the workshop and we use sticky notes

201
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,660
So if you have our

202
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:39,020
We do an exercise we say when you're done with the exercise put up a green sticky note on the front of your computer

203
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:45,420
And if you're having trouble put up a pink sticky note and someone will come help you

204
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,460
so that helps the learners see that

205
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,220
They can get some help and also helps the instructor know when the class is having challenge

206
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,540
So if you see a sea of pink sticky notes, you know, you need to re-explain that concept

207
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,740
We have the exercises as I mentioned

208
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,860
And then our survey designed to build confidence

209
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,300
So we did put some questions in our survey around skills

210
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,580
And the feedback was that people had a great experience in the workshop

211
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,780
and then they went and took those questions at the end and they felt like they failed

212
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:20,460
And was it most important that we knew whether or not they had learned exact syntax?

213
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:27,020
Or was it more important around that self-efficacy and that confidence? So it's influenced how we do our survey design

214
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,780
So what we believe about belonging

215
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:38,240
That community our effort that productive struggle and the value of the task leads to the engagement and the motivation

216
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,020
So

217
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,900
This is just a big recap of all these things and I did highlight some of the things that we do

218
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,040
But the concept is really important. What's so amazing about our community is they're always exploring

219
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,500
And learning about different ways to implement these things in the classroom

220
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,220
And so actually how many carpentries instructors are in the room?

221
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,740
Yeah, so feel free to reach out to any of these folks too to learn more about some of these things

222
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,780
Okay, so i'm going to quickly go just through some outcomes. So does this work?

223
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:16,140
So one it scales we have a lot of instructors. I talked about our instructor training that gives a lot of people the

224
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,580
Ability and interest to go teach workshops. So we teach them all over the world

225
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,620
But mostly does it improve confidence?

226
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,860
So when we see just a pre and post workshop of two days

227
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:37,740
We can see that things like confidence and programming and at the bottom and overcome problem in the middle

228
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:45,660
There's a full point difference in just two days and people's perception of their comfort their feeling of whether they can do this work

229
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:52,140
And these are the kinds of things they say about the workshop and this confidence persists long term

230
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,020
So when we do a survey six months more after the workshop

231
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,180
Almost a hundred percent of our respondents say I am more confident now

232
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,460
Which is surprising to me because the more I use python the less confident I feel actually

233
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:13,500
And that people have seen this as value they highly recommend these workshops is something they see as having a positive impact

234
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,020
And then they go on to continue learning

235
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,180
Which is the other thing that we want to see right that they have that self-effort cda going on to continue learning

236
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,260
Um

237
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,420
So these are a few different ways that we continue to learn and I think as we talk about the sprints

238
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,820
We'll see that there's lots of opportunities

239
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,860
um

240
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,900
So just kind of as a bit of a wrap-up

241
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,900
When we talk about how we teach it's how people feel

242
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,780
And so Maya Angelou i've learned that people will forget what you said people forget what you did

243
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,020
But people will never forget how you made them feel

244
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,660
And that's what we have the opportunity to do in our workshops to inspire people

245
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,100
To use these skills and keep using them in

246
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:04,780
In their work and in their lives to do amazing things and feel awesome about their capabilities

247
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,700
So and I thank the amazing carpentries community that does all of this work

248
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:14,700
And the opportunity we have here in this summit something we take to heart is if you want to go fast go alone

249
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,180
If you want to go far go together

250
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:23,840
And this community is great at coming together to work towards shared challenges, so thank you very much

251
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,580
You
