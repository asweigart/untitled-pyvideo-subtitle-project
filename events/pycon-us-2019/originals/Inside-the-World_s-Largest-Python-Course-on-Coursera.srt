1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
And welcome. This is my second PyCon Edu Summit.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,360
And I'm glad to be back.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,280
And I'm going to talk to you a little bit about what I think is the world's largest Python course.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,220
I'm going to keep saying that until someone says, no, you're not the world's largest Python course.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:20,320
It's the only way to figure out if you're the largest Python course in the world is just to assert

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,400
that you are and then people disagree with you.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,360
So here's some numbers to support that.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,280
I've graduated 140,000 people out of one of my many classes.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,360
And four million people have touched the class in one way or another.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,800
In the last 30 days, I graduated 4,500 new Python programmers somewhere in the world.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,120
That's just my Coursera numbers.

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,240
And in the last, this is, I went on edX three months ago.

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,120
We put the course on both Coursera and edX now.

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,880
And I'm basically graduating a whole bunch of people on edX now as well.

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,760
So there's a lot of people in this room that have a lot more Python seniority than I do.

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,160
I am relative to a lot of people.

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,920
I'm a latecomer to Python.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,440
And so I had a life before Python.

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,960
I have three computer science degrees, including a Ph.D.

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,960
I've taught virtually every programming language that was cool from 1975 until now.

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,480
I'm building online educational technology, taught online since 97.

22
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,920
I led the open source Sakai Learning Management System project.

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,320
And I've been a leader in building a thing called Learning Tools Interoperability,

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,440
which is how you plug Piazza into Moodle and Piazza into Canvas and

25
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,080
Piazza into Blackboard.

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,520
And so that's where I'm coming from.

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,520
I sort of met Python in 2008 when I quit my job as the executive director of

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,280
the Sakai Foundation because of a disagreement with my board of directors.

29
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,320
And I went and said I'll be a faculty member instead.

30
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,520
And so I walked into a classroom at a school of information at the University

31
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,640
of Michigan, which is a school of library science.

32
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,000
And I was presented with a classroom full of librarians and

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,280
told to teach them programming.

34
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,440
And the first task I had to find was a textbook.

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,920
And so I didn't like any textbook,

36
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,840
even though there were thousands of Python textbooks, even in 2008.

37
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,760
And so what I did is I had to write my own textbook.

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,720
And I started with the least worst Python textbook I could find,

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,400
which thanks to Jeff Elkner, Jeff and

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,240
Alan wrote the least worst computer science textbook that I could find.

41
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,160
And then I threw 75% of it away and wrote and added back to it.

42
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,040
And that's because I, and I'll try to only say this once,

43
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,840
I am not a computer science educator.

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,560
I have no desire to be a computer science educator.

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,560
I'm not all excited about taking every kid in the world and

46
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,000
making them a computer science major.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,080
I was a computer science major.

48
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,280
It's a rather narrow field.

49
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,520
It's not everything that we need.

50
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,720
I do, on the other hand, think everyone needs to understand programming

51
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,760
technology, and so that's sort of where I'm coming from.

52
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,440
So I vowed when I started teaching this class to librarians that I was going to

53
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,280
teach a technology class and a programming class, and it was going to be fun.

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,160
It was going to be joyful.

55
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,600
It was going to be artistic.

56
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,360
It was going to be engaging.

57
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,120
And so I am not interested in lambda expressions.

58
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,400
I'm not interested in recursion.

59
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,760
I'm not interested in n log n.

60
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,200
And I just don't think a bunch of nine year olds need to hear about n log n.

61
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,320
Actually, 30 year olds don't even need to hear about n log n.

62
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,120
What 30 year olds need to hear is, hey, just use a database, right?

63
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,440
And somebody else wrote it all, and you don't have to know that.

64
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,000
So I was sort of a Python educator for a while in my own little world, and then

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,480
the MOOC revolution happened in 2012.

66
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,720
And my first reaction was not to teach Python as a MOOC.

67
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,600
My first reaction was to teach a course called Internet History, Technology, and

68
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:57,400
Security, which was a course to trick liberal arts majors into learning the TCPIP stack.

69
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,000
Literally, that's what this course is.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,200
And that's why it says history.

71
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,840
It's like, hey, liberal arts majors, you could like this.

72
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,560
This could be fun.

73
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,680
It's just a history class.

74
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,440
It's going to talk about World War II and Enigma and Bletchley Park and

75
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,400
all these wonderful things.

76
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,920
And I'll show you videos of Bletchley Park and, oh, wait a second.

77
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,400
And then there's this thing called TCPIP that stacks on top.

78
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,520
And so what I would do is I would call it boiling the frog, right?

79
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,600
I would teach them that every liberal arts major who just thought history was cool

80
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,080
could eventually understand public-private certificates and encryption and encoding.

81
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,440
And at the end, I'm giving quizzes that are all in Rote 13, and I'm making them

82
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,240
decode the Rote 13 quizzes in order to answer my quizzes.

83
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,960
And I'm like, haha, technology's not so bad.

84
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,120
So part of my whole life has been to trick people into liking technology.

85
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,760
So as I was building my Python course, I built this in-browser, 100% in-browser,

86
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,680
Python development environment based on the Sculpt compiler that compiles

87
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,760
Python to JavaScript and then executes it.

88
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,960
But I actually was really interested in turning into a grading system, not a

89
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,160
development system, using this thing that I developed called Learning Tools

90
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,280
Interoperability, which allows you to build a tool, plug that tool into a

91
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,480
learning management system like Canvas or Coursera and send a grade back.

92
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,760
So I was trying to scale this.

93
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,840
And inadvertently, I built the entire first, I didn't set out to do this, but

94
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,680
the first 10 chapters of my book can be done completely on a phone, right?

95
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,640
Because it's all in browser, can be done on a Chromebook, can be done literally

96
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,320
on anything because it just runs Python in the browser and it sends the grades

97
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,640
back.

98
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,320
And my teaching assistant said that this was an important feature, and I did not

99
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,760
think it was an important feature.

100
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,320
When I started, I thought it was really important to teach people how to install

101
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,960
Python on their real computers and do it.

102
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,880
But it turns out to be really brilliant that I can teach the first 10 chapters of

103
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,280
this book without using a browser.

104
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,840
So these are my tattoos and they're real right here.

105
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:51,160
And I call them my research and my education, otherwise known as my curriculum

106
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,480
vita.

107
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,640
So I got a Ph.D. from Michigan State University and I'm a faculty member at the

108
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,520
University of Michigan.

109
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,720
Ph.D. is in engineering, the faculty position is in library science, yellow.

110
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,800
Allen, Elizabeth.

111
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,080
And Sakai and open source and learning tools interoperability was what this side

112
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,400
is about.

113
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,280
This is my research.

114
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,440
Educational technology is my research.

115
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,240
Open source, open standards.

116
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,840
The last tattoo I got was the Coursera tattoo where I went out to Coursera and I

117
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,920
added learning tools interoperability into Coursera so I could take my entire

118
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,840
Python class with its browser-based assessments and plug it into Coursera.

119
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,880
I did a few other things that are kind of fun.

120
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,440
I think that programming is about people.

121
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,320
So I happened to write for IEEE Computer Magazine and had a travel budget for a few

122
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,680
years and I made a bunch of videos.

123
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,120
One was Guido.

124
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,280
The second video, first video you see of my class is me and the second video that

125
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,760
you see in the class is Guido welcoming you to the class.

126
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,360
Now you could actually use Guido, my Guido video to welcome to your class because he

127
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,560
doesn't welcome them to my class.

128
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,840
He says welcome to Python.

129
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:02,120
Another thing that I do because I'm a frustrated actor actually, I would much

130
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,240
rather be a CNN anchor flying around the world with a television crew than I am a

131
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,520
professor but I do the next best thing and that is I make my course into a reality

132
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,400
show so I go all over the world and I meet my students.

133
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,520
I mean some of you may have gotten an email this morning because you are my

134
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,880
students about my next office hours in Detroit that's going to feature a race car.

135
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,920
Anybody get that email?

136
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,200
Yeah, a few people got that email.

137
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,200
And so I have a map.

138
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,240
You can go see it.

139
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,760
70 places all over the world where I just said hey I'm going to be at a coffee shop

140
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,520
in Amsterdam at 10 o'clock on Sunday.

141
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:32,920
Come by.

142
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,920
And then we make pictures and I make little videos and I have a map that has all

143
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,960
those videos.

144
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,560
Part of this is to take an otherwise technical dry topic and make it be a human topic.

145
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,880
People, people, people, people.

146
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,960
Oh and by the way we're going to learn about if statements this week.

147
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,160
People, people, people, people.

148
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,600
Oh we're going to learn about loops this week.

149
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,560
People, people, people.

150
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,720
So one of the things that's cool when you have millions of students is you learn

151
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,000
something about the world.

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,760
I have blind students and as an engineer I've always wanted blind students.

153
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,840
It's just you don't run into them very often.

154
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,240
So this is a blind school in India that I was able to visit.

155
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,120
There's a blind foundation out of Boston that supports these schools.

156
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,680
I now financially support these schools myself as well.

157
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,880
And I get to meet blind students and they tell me what works and what doesn't.

158
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,920
Turns out in browser programming is pretty good for blind students.

159
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,400
Way better than programming in something else like a command shell or something.

160
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,640
So another one of these pictures is my course got translated into Arabic.

161
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:27,880
Why?

162
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,880
Because there's so much money involved in how much money that you can make in Python.

163
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,960
And so the University of Michigan just went and paid a whole ton of money to translate

164
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,000
my course into Arabic and now it's on Coursera in Arabic.

165
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,760
One of the other things that when you're teaching at scale all people all over the

166
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,000
world is you have to become the entire university.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,920
You are the advisor, you're the registrar, your graduation,

168
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,120
your counseling for how to get a job.

169
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,000
You do a lot of things.

170
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,560
And so in my course I sprinkle all these things that you think that you get from

171
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,360
something other than the classroom in an educational situation.

172
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,440
How to get a job, recommendations.

173
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,680
I make little videos about what you should do next.

174
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,800
Now that you've finished this class you should go to a Python meetup.

175
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,520
You should do this.

176
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,320
You should do that.

177
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,440
You should do these other things.

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,680
So I even have a graduation where I had a graduation speaker but it's an online thing.

179
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,280
And so it's five I said you get five minutes to talk because this is online.

180
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,800
You're not going to get to talk for a long time.

181
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,200
So this Kurt Bonk from Indiana University who's a technology education guy.

182
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,200
And I had students that call me and they tell me that they cry at their graduation

183
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,520
because they've never been to a graduation in their life.

184
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,440
And I play pop and circumstance and I dress up with a funny hat and we give a little speech.

185
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,680
And they said it's the only graduation that they ever have done in their life or ever

186
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,880
expect to be able to do.

187
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,680
So it took off.

188
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,240
I started that class in 2014.

189
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,960
We celebrated when I taught more had graduated more students across all my classes than would

190
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,800
fit in the University of Michigan football stadium which is 111,000 and I taught 112.

191
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,160
So the PR people took me into the stadium and took a bunch of pictures with congratulations

192
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,160
to to my hundred and twelve thousand five hundred eighty five students.

193
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,480
That's now three years ago.

194
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,240
Yeah well that's okay.

195
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,480
Now into every life and every story a little rain must fall.

196
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,920
So one of the things of course Sarah did for their first three years is they had a double bottom line

197
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,160
of social social social a pro-social agenda as well as making money.

198
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,640
And when their venture capitalists were tired of the pro-social agenda after three years they

199
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,240
decided to tell Coursera to make money.

200
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,720
So there was a little battle between those of us who'd help build Coursera and Coursera itself.

201
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,120
And you can see some articles Coursera does because you can see some articles where I talk

202
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,400
about all this stuff where I never got into Coursera to make money right.

203
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,640
The University of Michigan never got into Coursera to make money.

204
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,480
We just thought this was the part of our job as a public university to make the world a better

205
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:03,800
place.

206
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,480
And Coursera wanted because my course is one of the most popular courses that they taught.

207
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,160
They wanted to put it behind a paywall and it took about a year and a half of shouting to before I

208
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,520
let them put it behind a paywall.

209
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,680
And what I did was in that year and a half of shouting I created a complete copy of the course

210
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,240
that I made complete open educational resources with creative commons videos open source.

211
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,040
And the day I rolled this out is the day I let they put my course behind a paywall.

212
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,480
And I told them my teaching assistants will tell every student who complains about the paywall

213
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,160
about the free version.

214
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,840
And they said I don't care as long as you don't have to put it in the course description.

215
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,240
You know it's like so at least they have to walk in hit the paywall get pissed and then we'll tell

216
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,680
them about the free version.

217
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,400
It literally is I built my own MOOC platform.

218
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,480
It's all open educational resources.

219
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,800
There are learning platforms that just download all my stuff and there's like a place in India

220
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,080
and a place in Korea a little learning platform with four thousand ten thousand students.

221
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,040
They take my stuff.

222
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,280
I'm the teacher but it's all creative commons.

223
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,880
That's what OER is supposed to be.

224
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,440
And of course Jeff gave me open education resources is the is the foundation of all this stuff.

225
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,160
So I've got a textbook and it's been translated into a bunch of languages and I have Jeff Jeff

226
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:27,480
and Alan to thank for that because long before it was cool Jeff because of the fact that

227
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,160
their book was built in the sort of the the incubation of the Python open source community

228
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,800
they decided they would make an open source book before Creative Commons even existed.

229
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,760
And that's the book that I forked and made and is now in a bunch of languages.

230
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:48,520
And this is probably the leading Python textbook in the world not for computer scientists.

231
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,360
And that's why it's about information.

232
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,000
I've always felt that looking at data about people is a far more motivating thing than

233
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,080
solving the eight queens problem using recursion.

234
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,960
So I am at this point like a publisher.

235
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,160
I am using this this platform that I have of millions of students to try to promote

236
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,280
Python even more broadly and push it even farther.

237
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,640
So I'm probably the only teacher that you can binge watch on Amazon Prime.

238
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,200
I make a total of twenty one dollars a month on average from Amazon Prime.

239
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,480
So it's not a very lucrative thing but part of my whole thing about being everywhere and making it so

240
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,240
no matter where you turn at any search box you type Python I want to come up first.

241
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,680
Another thing that I do is on Python for everybody I have what I call the University of Dr. Chuck.

242
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,080
And these are the students there's four thousand of them but there's more like ten thousand that

243
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,680
haven't put themselves on a map.

244
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,800
These are the students that have enrolled in the University of Dr. Chuck.

245
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,840
They don't enroll in Coursera they don't run the University of Michigan.

246
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,320
I have my own MOOC hosting platform that I built from scratch which is also open source.

247
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,680
It's written in PHP at least for the next year or so.

248
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,200
Yeah I know I've come to the light.

249
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,000
I've come to the light.

250
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,200
I'm coming to the light.

251
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,720
You'll see a happy ending here at the end.

252
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,440
And I also probably have about 150 courses around the world.

253
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,640
And so if you're familiar with Pearson's My Math Lab what I want to be

254
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,320
is I want to be the My Math Lab for Python.

255
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,840
I want to have a book that is a free book 999.

256
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,240
And I want to have a website that has got all the content all the backing material.

257
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,200
If you want to do a flip classroom it's right there for you and it plugs into the learning

258
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,080
management system whether it's Moodler, Canvas, or Sakai, or Blackboard.

259
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,920
And I have about 150 classes that have adopted my Dr. Chuck's Python My Math Lab.

260
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,280
And the difference between Meir and Pearson is everything is free and everything's Creative

261
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,440
Commons and there's no cost even to use my servers.

262
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,840
I don't even charge like Lumen charges that.

263
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,960
This is the thing that I didn't expect.

264
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:49,240
When I started teaching Python I thought Python was a good language for beginners

265
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,360
but then no grown-ups would ever use Python.

266
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,360
The whole purpose of Python was to teach you so that I could teach you a real programming

267
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,600
language like PHP so that when you grow up you use like PHP or something like Java.

268
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,040
That's what grown-ups use, right?

269
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
And that's how I felt in 2008.

270
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,720
I was tremendously wrong.

271
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,600
I wrote an Acura article called What's the Next Big Thing in Python?

272
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,560
And briefly summarized is what I think the next big thing in Python is Python is literally

273
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,160
going to eat every programming language and spit it out and destroy it.

274
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,080
Meaning that we've never seen in the history, the 40-year history of computer science,

275
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:34,440
a language that is more unintentionally aggressive towards other languages in the fact that it's

276
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,880
destroying other things.

277
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,840
So it turns out that teaching Python is very lucrative.

278
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
I could have a couple of Teslas if I wanted.

279
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,400
I could have a new house.

280
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,400
But I decided to take up auto racing instead so I have a race car.

281
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,400
If those of you saw, I'm going to be demonstrating my race car in Detroit in a little bit.

282
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,840
The race car is run by Open Source Racing with a Corsair logo and a Sakai logo.

283
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,640
The whole thing is this joke about Open Source that makes it look like a cool race car.

284
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,920
So I want to talk in the last four minutes that I've got about where I'm going to take this.

285
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,600
I see this world now from almost the perspective of I'm Pearson, right?

286
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,720
So the next class, I'm repenting.

287
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,320
I'm repenting my five years of dalliance with PHP.

288
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:27,000
I have a whole Corsair specialization called Web Applications for Everybody in PHP.

289
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,760
And it's very popular, but it's not as popular as this one's going to be when I'm done with it.

290
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,200
And so I'm going to have a specialization on Corsair called Django for Everybody.

291
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,960
I just finished teaching a Django course at the University of Michigan.

292
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:45,400
It's got auto graders and it's got Creative Commons, Open Source software, you know, the drill, right?

293
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,160
So I expect to have this on Corsair kind of a little less than a year from right now.

294
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,520
Corsair tells me that the most searched for term on Corsair is Python.

295
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,120
The most searched for term for a course that they don't have is Django.

296
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,920
So I think Django is going to be a kind of big deal pretty soon.

297
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,160
Although this is one of the things that I'm actually most proud of and this started in

298
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,520
January and it's the thing that I can, I'd love to if we had sprint time to talk about this.

299
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,400
I've been contacted by a series of liberal arts schools, about 100 of them,

300
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,160
that want to add technology to their curriculum in a way that doesn't harm the liberal arts schools

301
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,880
and destroy them.

302
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,160
There's often computer science and liberal arts meet and then one of them dies.

303
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,680
Usually it's liberal arts.

304
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,920
And so I'm trying to build a way that you can take a fashion student or a writing student

305
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,400
and make them like technology and teach Python.

306
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,960
So I have a whole different curriculum.

307
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:47,080
I have a whole different, an idea of it is not just to make it a technology class,

308
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,200
but to make it a technology plus a thinking, critical thinking about technology.

309
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,240
So you spend time reading books about technology and arguing and debating about technology and

310
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,960
wondering about technology and wondering about artificial intelligence.

311
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,720
And oh, by the way, this week we're also going to teach you a statements along with all this

312
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,080
cool reading that you're doing.

313
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,960
And the whole goal of this will, I'll be successful if it means that liberal arts schools do not have

314
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,240
to add any faculty.

315
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,520
Literally I can take somebody from the writing department and have them teach the Python

316
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,600
course and bring the writing into the Python course.

317
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,560
Take somebody from the physics department, have them teach the Python course, which means

318
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:22,840
I got to teach them how to do Python and then give them enough materials so that it's really

319
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,160
easy.

320
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,040
And this is my secret plan.

321
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,840
And I hear a lot this morning talking about this and that is I really am not excited about

322
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,400
the way high school, most, I'm really not excited about what 99% of high schools teach

323
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,680
computing and computer science.

324
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,920
I think it's terrible, to be honest.

325
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,280
So I'm building slowly but surely because high schools are a tough nut to crack.

326
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
We've heard that a bunch of times this morning.

327
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,120
I figure the only way that I can help high schools is if I can build a whole curriculum

328
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,200
with a whole set of books and a whole set of supporting materials and then high schools

329
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,880
will find their way to it as compared to me going and banging on high school doors saying

330
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,000
I got this great idea.

331
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,680
And that's where liberal arts colleges are easier to get into than high schools are to

332
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,080
get into.

333
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,800
But I basically have this entire curriculum that is intended to be a scratch to AP computer

334
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,360
science curriculum and happy to talk with people about that.

335
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,400
And so here's the moment of inception.

336
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,920
So my whole career has been in building open source educational technology and that is

337
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,720
how I teach.

338
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,360
But the thing that really is going to be the greatest joy in my life, and this would be

339
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,600
another thing we could do a sprint on, is this is a Django application that can plug

340
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,160
into Canvas that can send grades back to Canvas in 20 lines of code.

341
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,840
The inception moment is I am creating the world's largest Python class to teach, to

342
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,040
build, have students go into the world's largest Django class to then create hundreds of thousands

343
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,320
of people who can build new educational technology applications so that we can teach just anything

344
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,960
that we want.

345
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,320
Thank you for your time.

346
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,320
Thank you.
