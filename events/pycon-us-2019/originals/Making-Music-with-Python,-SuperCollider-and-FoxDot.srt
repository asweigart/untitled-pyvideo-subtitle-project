1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
session.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,420
Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to this afternoon

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,420
session of

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,680
PyCon 2019, our first speaker is Jessica Garson, who is going to

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,680
make some music for us, so make her feel welcome.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,700
.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,260
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,620
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,180
But before we get started, I'm going to give you my contact information.

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,680
I can't wait to hear what you create.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,640
So if you are inspired to make some music, please send it to me.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,960
I really want to hear it.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,220
So my email is Jessica.Garson.Gmail.com.

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,320
And my Twitter handle, I work at Twitter actually as well, is at Jessica Garson.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,600
And if you want to listen to my music, you can find my bandcamp at messicaarsson.bandcamp.com.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,280
So also, if you want to follow along, there's some slides.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,640
And they are available at PyCon-makingmusic.glig.me.

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,040
Again, that's PyCon-makingmusic.glig.me.

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,840
And you can find my slides there.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,200
And if you want some code and next steps, there is a repository on my GitHub that has

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,040
where all the code is found.

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,020
You can also hear my music in a couple of different places.

23
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,460
If you want a noise tape mailed to you, hit me up via Twitter.

24
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,340
And if you want to see me play music, there's some places where you can find that.

25
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,060
And there's also some sample scripts.

26
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,020
And I'll be posting any code later today too.

27
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,820
And so the way that this is going to go is it's going to be a bit of a live coded adventure.

28
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,780
I'm going to write a song during this talk.

29
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,540
So it should be fun.

30
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,660
But also, there's a lot of really great Python programmers in this room.

31
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,140
And this is a live coded venture.

32
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,660
So if you see something, say something.

33
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,940
I'm sure I'm going to have a couple of syntax errors.

34
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:07,180
Please help your friend out and let me know if anything is looking weird.

35
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,300
And you might be wondering, Jess, I heard you say Messika Arson.

36
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,300
Who's that?

37
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,300
What is that?

38
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,740
So Messika Arson is a moniker that started for me when I was in third grade.

39
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,620
We were learning about arson, which is really strange for a group of third graders.

40
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,540
I'm not really sure why there was a firefighter that came to the classroom.

41
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,260
And pretty quickly, my last name is Arson.

42
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,340
Everybody was like Arson, Garson.

43
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,860
That was pretty cool.

44
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,140
But there was this one girl, a genius named Kate, who sat next to me.

45
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,820
And she was like, Messika Arson.

46
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,100
Because I was always a messy child.

47
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,100
And I still am.

48
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,500
I was like, man, I'm going to use that.

49
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,860
I sang in a bunch of punk bands.

50
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,340
I was like, if I ever have a solo project, I'm going to use Messika Arson.

51
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,940
I didn't think that my solo project was going to be me writing code and sampling myself

52
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,940
screaming.

53
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,940
But here we are.

54
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,940
We're here to talk about that.

55
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,780
And with that being said, I did want to kind of give a little bit of a warning.

56
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,020
I'm going to be sampling myself screaming, I believe, at one point during this.

57
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,140
There's going to be scream samples that will be played.

58
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,140
And there'll be noise music.

59
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,140
That's not for everybody.

60
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,140
And that's OK.

61
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,020
If this talk isn't for you, I didn't want to give you a little bit of a warning before.

62
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,020
Nobody's leaving.

63
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,020
So that's great.

64
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,020
Cool.

65
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,020
This is awesome.

66
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,500
And so this has become basically one of my favorite things to do.

67
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,820
As a programmer, it's really fun to find kind of a side project that you're really passionate

68
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,820
about.

69
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,980
And for me, there's something incredibly magical about your computer making sounds because

70
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,940
your code told it to you.

71
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,660
It's one of the best feelings when you finally get that working.

72
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,340
You're like, yes, this is awesome.

73
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:55,420
So I perform regularly with a collective in New York City called LiveCode.nyc.

74
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:03,180
And one time, this very famous live-coded artist came to visit us in New York, and he

75
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,180
crashed his computer.

76
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,660
And it was almost like the musical equivalent of breaking a guitar, of smashing a guitar

77
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,660
on stage.

78
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,340
And I was like, yeah, someday I want to do that.

79
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,340
Hopefully it's not today.

80
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,380
But there is something really magical about making art with your code.

81
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,460
And so I hope that you are able to enjoy that.

82
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,940
So what is FoxDot?

83
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,580
FoxDot is a wrapper for another language called SuperCollider.

84
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,660
And it allows us to interact with our computer as if we were using a synthesizer.

85
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,420
How many people have used a synthesizer before?

86
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,420
Wow.

87
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,540
That's like most of you.

88
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,820
And you know how you can have knobs and kind of move things and you can kind of set the

89
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,860
levels that you want?

90
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,380
I could do that with my code, and it's super awesome.

91
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,780
And the other really great thing about FoxDot is that you can make a lot of sound with a

92
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,280
little bit of code.

93
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,740
And when you're performing in front of people, things can get really nerve-racking.

94
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,380
So little code is good sometimes.

95
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,500
And you might be wondering, where can you get this?

96
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,660
So you can get it at foxdot.org slash installation.

97
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,140
And as I mentioned, FoxDot is built on top of another language called SuperCollider,

98
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,300
and you actually have to download that first, and you have to manually start it.

99
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:19,660
So we can go in, and because I had to sound check in the room, some folks got to hear

100
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:27,220
it earlier, it's already pre-started for me, but I had to type in foxdot.start.

101
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,340
And there's a couple different ways to launch FoxDot.

102
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,780
But the first way that we're going to talk about is through the command line.

103
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,940
So it's python-m foxdot.

104
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:48,020
And now it launches this interactive development environment.

105
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:55,020
So from here, let's actually, we could do P1, and we could do pluck.

106
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,020
Thank you.

107
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,940
Yeah, I was just getting ready to do that, but I like using my editor, and we're going

108
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,940
to get to that in a second.

109
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,940
But so from here, cool.

110
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,940
We're making some sound.

111
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,940
We can kind of see it coming through.

112
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:16,940
From here, we're actually going to stop it, and I'm actually going to unlaunch it.

113
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,940
It does behave a little bit quirky sometimes.

114
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,940
No, I'm not going to do that.

115
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,940
But I do want to show you a couple of different things.

116
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,940
So you saw where I was writing the code, and you saw where the terminal was running.

117
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,940
There's also a tutorial, which is super awesome.

118
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,940
And what you can do is you can follow along as you go.

119
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,940
So we started with this pluck, and we did that, but let's try to run these lines.

120
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:45,940
And then from here, you can see it kind of changing as you go.

121
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,940
And so this, to me, is the coolest part that you could just learn and kind of change it.

122
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,940
And that's how I got started.

123
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,940
I just followed the examples and then changed them until it sounded nothing like the examples

124
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,940
and then was like, hmm, what would happen if I replaced it with a file of myself screaming

125
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,940
and, you know, fun things happen?

126
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,940
And as you noticed, I was fumbling a little bit.

127
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,940
I like my editor a lot.

128
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:17,940
So I tend to use the Fox.package for Atom, and I tend to run code in my own development

129
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,940
environment, which is Atom these days.

130
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,940
So because of that, I like to do that.

131
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:31,940
And you might be wondering, okay, Jess, you've been talking for a few minutes now.

132
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,940
You promised us that we were going to make a song together.

133
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,940
So let's do that.

134
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,940
You excited?

135
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,940
Okay, cool.

136
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,940
So I typically like to start with the synth default.

137
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,940
So let's print synths.

138
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,940
And we have a list of synths.

139
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,940
There's dirt.

140
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,940
There's crunch.

141
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,940
There's my favorite pluck.

142
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,940
There's a bunch of different ones.

143
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:07,940
So let's actually start with let's do well.

144
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:16,940
And now let's add in noise.

145
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,940
Bass.

146
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,940
Cool.

147
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,940
So we're starting to put in some built-in synths in here.

148
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,940
And now from here, we can actually pass an array in.

149
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,940
And these are notes that we're passing in.

150
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,940
So we can do.

151
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,940
So we can hear our code start to change, which is pretty exciting.

152
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,940
So that's the first little bit.

153
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:16,940
And what we're doing is we're assigning player object one into noise, and then we're passing an array through.

154
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:25,940
And you might have noticed or you might not have noticed, but the tempo was set to BPM 120, which is 120 beats per minute.

155
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,940
We can actually change that BPM and make things go faster or slower.

156
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,940
So let's do that.

157
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,940
So we can use clock to do that.

158
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,940
So we can do clock.BPM.

159
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,940
And clock controls all of the timing for all of this, which is super fun.

160
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,940
So let's change it to 130.

161
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:59,940
And if we go to maybe 90, we could hear it go slower.

162
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,940
Let's go to 180.

163
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,940
Cool.

164
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,940
So we're starting to kind of make a song.

165
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,940
It's pretty fun.

166
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,940
We can also do the built-in samples.

167
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,940
So now if we want to take a look at the samples, let's do the same thing that we did earlier.

168
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,940
So we could do print samples.

169
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,940
We can run this line.

170
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,940
And from here, we have a bunch of samples.

171
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:35,940
Now, it's kind of lying to me because I've replaced a lot of the samples with myself screaming.

172
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,940
So that isn't what we have.

173
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,940
So let's play some of that.

174
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,940
Let's do high pinecon.

175
00:10:47,940 --> 00:11:14,940
Cool.

176
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,940
So now we are starting to make some sounds.

177
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:26,940
That's my favorite thing to do, which is to write messages to you all with my code.

178
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,940
So yeah, that's exciting.

179
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,940
So now a couple of different things about samples.

180
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,940
So there are two different ways to add in samples.

181
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,940
As you might have noticed, one of the things that I did was I played that sample of myself screaming.

182
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,940
You might be wondering, Jess, how did you put that in there?

183
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:54,940
So if we go to help in settings and we go to open samples folder, we get a samples folder that has a bunch of different things put in.

184
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:02,940
And then if we go to C, because you heard the C was myself screaming, we have upper and lower.

185
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,940
And these were things I recorded.

186
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,940
There are some funny ones like ended and vagrant is one.

187
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:14,940
Sorry if anybody works on vagrant, but there is a file of vagrant.wave, which is just myself screaming.

188
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,940
So things happen.

189
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,940
It's really great.

190
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,940
Yeah, so that's one way.

191
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,940
There's another way.

192
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,940
So NASA, how many people like NASA's APIs and products?

193
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,940
They're really awesome.

194
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,940
Okay, cool.

195
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,940
Shout out to their stuff.

196
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,940
They have a samples library, which is so cool.

197
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,940
And I love using it for stuff.

198
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,940
So we can take this path, which is the wave file.

199
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,940
I never can remember my file path in front of people.

200
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:48,940
Like I perform regularly and I always need to kind of paste it.

201
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,940
So from here we could say loop, which lets us loop this.

202
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,940
And from here we also have to set the duration.

203
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,940
For some strange reason it clips it off.

204
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,940
So you have to set the duration to 10 for like a full sample to play.

205
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,940
I learned this the hard way.

206
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,940
But yeah, cool.

207
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,940
We'll play it in a second.

208
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,940
Cool.

209
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,940
Cool.

210
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,940
So now we've added in one of our own samples.

211
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,940
And now this is going to be the fun part.

212
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,940
A lot of times when I perform I have to be really careful.

213
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,940
Okay, so we have to set the duration to 10.

214
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,940
So I can set the duration to 10.

215
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,940
So that's good.

216
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,940
And then the other way of doing that is I can just set the duration to 10.

217
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,940
And then I can just set the duration to 10.

218
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,140
the fun part. A lot of times when I perform I record myself sampling myself

219
00:13:53,140 --> 00:14:02,020
on stage and this works some of the time so hopefully the live demo gods

220
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,180
are on my side today on this front.

221
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,180
Alright.

222
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,180
Got our pen there.

223
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,180
Cool.

224
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:18,180
So now, now this is where we're gonna, I'm gonna sample myself screaming.

225
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:28,180
Cool. So what I do is I basically use, I have this mic that's connected to my laptop.

226
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:34,180
Super fun. Very low tech but I love it. And now from here we can record.

227
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,180
Ah!

228
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,180
Cool. And actually let's try this again because it didn't seem to work.

229
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,180
Doesn't always work.

230
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,180
This is the most embarrassing part because it never works the way I want it to.

231
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,180
Ah! Ah!

232
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,180
Doesn't look like it's picking up. Oh well.

233
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,180
That's typically how I do it and then I kind of paste my follow path from there.

234
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,180
But now you know, works about 70% of the time.

235
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:03,180
If you have any ideas for other suggestions about how to do it, let me know.

236
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:08,180
One of the things, so one of the greatest things about writing code in this way

237
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,180
is opening yourself up to making errors in front of people and like sometimes it sounds weird,

238
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,180
sometimes it doesn't work and that's okay and that's part of the process.

239
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,180
So I love making music in this way because of that.

240
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:26,180
So now that we've talked about the couple different ways to make, to add samples

241
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,180
and we've tried to record one, didn't really work so well.

242
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,180
From here, now we can actually add some effects into our sound.

243
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:39,180
And so effects let us kind of customize our sound and add different things like distortion,

244
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,180
one of my favorites, but we're going to add a couple of different ones in

245
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,180
and I'm going to make some music for you, if that's alright.

246
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,180
Let's go.

247
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

248
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

249
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

250
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

251
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

252
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

253
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

254
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

255
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

256
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

257
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

258
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

259
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

260
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

261
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

262
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

263
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,180
Cover your eyes, cover your eyes, you're going for the ploy.

264
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,180
Cover your eyes.

265
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,180
I'm gonna get there.

266
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,180
I'm gonna get there.

267
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,180
I'm gonna get there.

268
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:29,180
So yeah, I added some fun effects to make myself sound cool.

269
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,180
What I added was amp, which is short for amplitude, and that's the loudness of the sound.

270
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:39,180
We also have compress, which is the process of lessening the dynamic range

271
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:44,180
between the loudest and quietest parts of the audio signal, so it basically squishes everything together.

272
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,180
Attack, which is basically the initial buildup of sound.

273
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,180
There's pan, which is the distribution between the sound signals.

274
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:57,180
How many people have listened to headphones and they've heard music coming in one year

275
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,180
and then later on it comes into the other year? How many people have ever heard that?

276
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:05,180
There's a couple of popular songs that have that. That's done with pan, which is really cool.

277
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:10,180
And then there's decay, which is the progressive reduction in the amplitude of sound over time,

278
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,180
and I love to play with that.

279
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,180
And then rate is what made me kind of sound creepy like a ghost.

280
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:21,180
It's one of my favorite party tricks. I use it to adjust the rate of playback,

281
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,180
and it makes my vocals sound deeper and weirder and creepier.

282
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,180
Hopefully you enjoyed that. Cool.

283
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,180
So you might have seen me stopping things a little bit along the way,

284
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,180
but there's a couple of different ways to do that.

285
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,180
And as you notice, one of my favorite things...

286
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,180
To me, my music is all about creating something beautiful and destroying it all.

287
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,180
So I like to play with texture a lot and reveal sometimes that the beautiful thing

288
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,180
that you heard at the beginning of my set is still happening,

289
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,180
but I've just kind of replaced it with scream samples that kind of sound like ambulances

290
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,180
and things like that.

291
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,180
And so, I don't know, I like to play with that and using .stop lets me.

292
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,180
So I'm going to show you what that's like for a second.

293
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:27,180
Cool.

294
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,180
So now clocked at clear. That stops the clock from running.

295
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:36,180
I've also been using the keyboard shortcut for clocked at clear the whole time during this,

296
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,180
but .stop and .clocked at clear are the two ways.

297
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,180
And .stop just stops the line.

298
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,180
And so you might be wondering how is this all working?

299
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:53,180
This is working using concurrency, and you should stay in this room for the talk after mine,

300
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,180
which will dive into the depths of concurrency.

301
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:04,180
But what's happening here is that, for example, for player object one, for swell,

302
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:11,180
we are passing in using a bitwise operator on channel P1,

303
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,180
and we're passing in swell with the array and the decay and all of that,

304
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,180
and that's how that works.

305
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,180
One thing I also wanted to show you really quickly is how to create functions

306
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,180
and how functions can call each other, which is really cool.

307
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,180
So what we can do is we can create a function.

308
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:42,180
So I'm going to create a function called hello, and let's put in...

309
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:48,180
And then from here, let's maybe put in...

310
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,180
Profit is a good one.

311
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,180
And then we can make...and we can call hello.

312
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:00,180
So let's actually run this block of code.

313
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,180
And now we can make another function called PyCon.

314
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:20,180
And let's put in...let's do ambi, which is a fun one.

315
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:28,180
And then from here, we can pass in...or let's just call PyCon.

316
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:42,180
And so from here...and let's actually change this to channel P3.

317
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,180
Now what we can do is we can actually call them to each other.

318
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:54,180
So clock.future...and you can set the timings.

319
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,180
We can do 9, and then let's call hello.

320
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,180
And then from here, one of the coolest things that you can actually call

321
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:09,180
functions that haven't been run yet, which is super awesome.

322
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,180
So from here, let's do clock.future.

323
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:22,180
And let's do tin and call PyCon, which is super awesome.

324
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:26,180
And that's how you can call things to control the timing.

325
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,180
And I like to do that to make verses and choruses with each other.

326
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,180
Cool.

327
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,180
Cool.

328
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:42,180
So now I've made a couple of errors, but one of the best things about

329
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:48,180
making errors in FoxDot is even if you make mistakes, it still keeps running.

330
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,180
So that's something that's really cool.

331
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,180
I wish life was like that.

332
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,180
It just runs the last successful loop.

333
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,180
So people don't really know.

334
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,180
I once, during a show, actually was looking up Stack Overflow, and the

335
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,180
entire audience was cheering.

336
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,180
So that was really cool.

337
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,180
And there was still one loop that was happening.

338
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,180
So yeah, luckily it didn't come to that today.

339
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:18,180
And you can also record inside of SuperColliner, and you can do s.record

340
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:23,180
and s.stop recording when you're done.

341
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,180
And you just run them line by line, which is pretty cool.

342
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,180
So I've been talking for a while, and you're probably like, ah, Jess, this is

343
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,180
such a boring talk.

344
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,180
And so maybe we can make some music together.

345
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,180
So don't tweet yet, but in a few minutes when I tell you to, you could tweet

346
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:44,180
at MassacreArson the words hi, hello, or yo.

347
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,180
Keep in mind that we do have a code of conduct here, and there is a possibility

348
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,180
that your tweet to me might show in my code.

349
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,180
So keep that in mind.

350
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,180
Try to be nice and respectful for all of us.

351
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:01,180
And now I'm going to kind of talk through what I'm doing, and hopefully when I

352
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:06,180
tell you to tweet at me, you all will tweet at me and we'll make some music

353
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
together.

354
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:12,180
This is the scariest part of the talk, so hopefully this works well.

355
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,180
So I've created the script.

356
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:18,180
I work at Twitter, and I was like, oh, cool, we should use the Twitter API to

357
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,180
make music together.

358
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,180
So I had to handle the auth.

359
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:27,180
So from here, I'm going to run this line of code.

360
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:32,180
And then, oh, I have a little bit of a syntax error which happens sometimes.

361
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,180
Oh, where?

362
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,180
Oh, cool, great.

363
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,180
I'm a little bit nervous running this in front of all of you all.

364
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,180
So appreciate the live coding community, which everybody in this room is now a

365
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,180
part of.

366
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,180
And so from here, I pass everything through requests.

367
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:55,180
I pass my account name and my username, my password, all of that.

368
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,180
And then from here, I actually process the response.

369
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,180
And so from here, I do some fun stuff with the encoding, and I run this line by

370
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,180
line, which is super cool.

371
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,180
And then I process the word.

372
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,180
And then from here, I parse the word.

373
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:18,180
And so I also have passed it in to map to just some fun things.

374
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,180
I really like the B to buy for whatever reason.

375
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,180
I end all of my shows with it.

376
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,180
And this is the ending.

377
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,180
So that's what one of the options is.

378
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:30,180
And then I pass in hello, just to make sure that things are working well.

379
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:34,180
And now from here, I'm going to handle all the auth.

380
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:40,180
And then from here, I should be getting a 200, which I have not gotten.

381
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,180
Cool.

382
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,180
Now you all can start tweeting at me.

383
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,180
Cool.

384
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,180
And again, it's hi, hello, or yo.

385
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:52,180
And it's Messica Arson, not Jessica Garson.

386
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:58,180
And then from here, cool.

387
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,180
Somebody typed yo to me.

388
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,180
That worked.

389
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,180
Great.

390
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:09,180
And since we're running a little bit short on time, also shout out to that working.

391
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,180
Yay.

392
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:16,180
If you want to see that code, you can find it on Twitter dev's GitHub at

393
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:21,180
github.com-twitterdev-makingmusictogether.

394
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,180
And if you want to learn how to do this, there's some resources on my GitHub.

395
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:30,180
And there's also some really nice people on the internet at talk.org.org.org

396
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,180
channel Fox.

397
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,180
com, including the person who created Fox.

398
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,180
And I can't wait to hear what you create.

399
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,180
Go on and make some awesome music.

400
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,180
Thank you.
