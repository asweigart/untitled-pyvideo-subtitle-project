1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,960
I've got this. Thank you. So thank you everybody for being here today. The Python Education

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,000
Summit is one of my favorite events of the year because it's the only place all year

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,820
I get to be around a whole bunch of people who are just as passionate as me about education

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:30,420
and Python. And that's a really special sort of nerd, I have to say. So thank you for making

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:38,100
it what it is by being here. So today we are going to be having a conversation together

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:45,500
and working together on open education resources for Python. So I wanted to really dig into

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,580
those resources work. What do we need? How can we do this differently? How can we build

8
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:59,300
on what we're doing? And because this is a Python conference, I have put all of this

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:10,300
into a form, the Zen of Python open education resources. So let me grab this. It works.

10
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:16,700
All right. So if it's your thing, please tweet along. Part of the theme today is bringing

11
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:23,100
together people in the technology sector and education sector. So I've put up hashtags

12
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:35,600
that are popular in tech and in education. There we go. So I want to start out by telling

13
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:47,100
you about the best Python open education resource I've ever created. I used to work for a start-up

14
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:55,200
where I was writing middle school Python curriculum. We had a visual interface that was in the

15
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,920
browser. Students could code in Python and very much like Scratch, they would see an

16
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,920
animation in the browser that they could program. So we really struggled between how do you

17
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,280
show guide instruction and support students versus helping them build open and problem-solving

18
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,280
skills. And we struggled with that balance. We had some great tutorials, but we kept hearing

19
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,880
from teachers, students aren't retaining the information. They aren't able to apply the

20
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:35,200
skills. So I had this great idea. They'll go through the tutorial. At the end of every

21
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,920
lesson, they'll complete an open-ended project that asks them to apply the skills that they

22
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,920
just learned. It will be creative. It will be great. So an example of that, they were

23
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,720
learning to program shapes. So we took the artwork of Alma Thomas as inspiration and

24
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:03,040
we asked them to look at her artwork and create something in that style using Python. I was

25
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:11,480
excited. This had everything. It was open-ended problem-solving. It was creative and artistic.

26
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,040
It went into expressionist art. It was bringing forward the work of a black woman artist.

27
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:25,040
I was so excited. It had everything. But I started going into classrooms and I realized

28
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:32,880
no one was using it. They were skipping all of my open-ended projects. When I asked why,

29
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:39,320
the teacher said, it's too hard. The kids don't know where to start. We just, we can't

30
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:45,720
do it. And I would always figure out a way that they could make it work. I would say,

31
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:52,120
well, have you tried all our supports? There's code comments that you can use as a guide.

32
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,480
There's a project planner that you should be using with your kids. I had all these supports

33
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,920
and I could always figure out how they must be able to make it work. Well, three years

34
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,520
later I was coaching a teacher in a classroom who happened to be using this curriculum and

35
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:17,520
they were skipping the open-ended projects. With some distance I was able to see that

36
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:25,360
I had missed an opportunity to make my resource work. Because it didn't work in the classroom,

37
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,120
it didn't matter that I could make it work. It mattered that the teachers could make it

38
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,840
work. Because they couldn't make it work, no students were using these amazing projects.

39
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,880
I still think they're great, but I missed the opportunity to have them actually be used.

40
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,440
So that brings me to one of my biggest mantras that teachers I work with will constantly

41
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:01,440
hear me say. If it doesn't work in the classroom, it doesn't work. End of story. So we have

42
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,240
all these great ideas and great interventions for computer science teachers, but if they

43
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,240
can't make it work, it sits there and it doesn't get used. So how can we make our open

44
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,520
education resources work instead of sitting on a metaphorical shelf? Well, before we get

45
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,000
into that, you might be asking, why am I talking about classrooms? Maybe when you think of

46
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,280
these resources you're like, well, they're used after school. They're used at home for

47
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,320
free learning for kids who are really interested. They're used in nonprofits. Those are all

48
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:50,320
great uses and that's very valid. I want to challenge everyone here, no matter what area

49
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:58,160
that you work in, to think about, in addition to that, starting to contribute to classroom

50
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,160
resources. And here's the reason. There is a movement called CS for All. This is a movement

51
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,360
to include all public school students in computer science education. Think of this, you might

52
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,680
ask why. Think of this like science. We teach every kid basic science and then when they

53
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,760
get to high school they have to take a certain number of credits and then if they want to,

54
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,440
they want to go into a STEM career, they can take more advanced courses or more specialized

55
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:37,440
courses. But we want every student to have a basic understanding of what is the scientific

56
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:44,440
method? How do I evaluate things in the real world using science? That's important to them

57
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:51,600
functioning as an adult and this is the same philosophy. That we want them to be computationally

58
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:59,320
literate. So the gold standard for this is a required class, a standard for a class,

59
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,240
during the regular school day. That's not happening everywhere and that's okay, but

60
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,240
that's where a lot of places are moving towards. So it's also widening our circle of who takes

61
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,280
computer science courses and who programs. This includes lots of groups who have been

62
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:26,600
underrepresented in the past in programming and that also, just to point out, includes

63
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
students with disabilities. So as we're programming, I mean as we're writing materials, we want

64
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,560
to think about students who are from different cultural backgrounds than us. Students who

65
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,920
learn in a variety of ways. There are many things to consider and then additionally I

66
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:54,920
want you to know that this isn't a singular movement. It's being adopted in different

67
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,560
areas, in different ways and it's slowly all growing, but different states and cities may

68
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:10,420
define this differently. So now that you have a background for that, I hope that I've inspired

69
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,840
you to think about the classroom as we move forward. I also want to give us a background

70
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:25,840
of open education resources versus open source software because I think that many people

71
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:32,280
in this room may have worked in open source software before, but not necessarily open

72
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:39,280
education resources, possibly vice versa. So they're similar in that both resources

73
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,080
are meant to be shared widely, used, remixed, repackaged and I think that's a good thing

74
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:56,240
for everyone. For both contributors are very passionate about what they do and also in

75
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:07,320
both of them there can be a problem with borrowing liberally without attribution from others,

76
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:14,840
though not always. So there are commonalities. Some of the differences are open source software

77
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:22,560
really focuses on and again this is very general, this may not be true of every project, but

78
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:30,120
to be very general on collaboration. Programs are living projects, so they're taking contributions

79
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:39,360
from others, their projects are changing. So that's one thing that's happening there.

80
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,600
In open ed resources often you're creating a lesson, you're creating a project, you create

81
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,520
it, post it, it's done. And a lot of times that's a single person working on it. It might

82
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:58,080
be a teacher who's sharing what they did, but it's not an ongoing collaboration in the

83
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,360
same way open source software has been. And so what I would like to do is think about

84
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,520
taking the principles from each of these and how can we bring them together and work

85
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:17,520
together as technologists and educators to take the best of both worlds. So to dig into

86
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,000
that we're going to use a case study from a program I started last year called Raspberry

87
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Pie in a Box. This was through the K12 education initiative at Cornell Tech. They were able

88
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:41,360
to, they had a mandate for us to innovate and see, make computer science education work

89
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:49,240
in schools, and so this was part of that. So the problem we wanted to address is that

90
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,480
everywhere but specifically in New York City, middle school students, especially middle

91
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,480
school students in Title I public schools, did not have access, the same access to physical,

92
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:11,360
computing, like Raspberry Pie, Arduino, all sorts of digital making that students in private

93
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:18,640
schools and better funded schools had the opportunity to do. And so we were like, why?

94
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,480
Why does that happen? Well, the teachers aren't trained. It's a big time commitment for this

95
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,880
type of training. The cost is prohibitive because it's not just somebody can donate

96
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,880
Chromebooks, it's all the little pieces, all the parts. It's very complicated to manage

97
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,440
in the classroom, but we see that middle schoolers really need something tangible in their computer

98
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:54,560
science classes, and it also addresses some of the topics that are missing in curriculum,

99
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,160
such as networks and computing systems. Another thing that we notice is middle schoolers were

100
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:07,140
learning to program in the browser, and this was building up some misconceptions for them.

101
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:13,900
So they would log in just like they log into an online game, and they would make something

102
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:20,900
happen, just like they could do in some other type of game or activity, and so they weren't

103
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:27,960
really understanding how does software work with hardware? What is coding really doing?

104
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,160
What's it good for in the real world? I can make a cat move, but what does that mean?

105
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:41,160
So we wanted to make this tangible and help students see computing systems in action.

106
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Our solution was a one-to-one Raspberry Pi program. What that means is we envisioned

107
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,520
incoming sixth graders receiving their own Raspberry Pi. These Raspberry Pis would live

108
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,600
at the school, but by the end of their middle school years, when they graduated eighth

109
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,120
grade, they would take home with them a working computer full of a portfolio of their computer

110
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:16,820
science work. In addition to that, so it also addressed students who didn't have access

111
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:23,820
to computers and portfolios for getting into high school, etc. Our goal was to keep the

112
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:30,620
cost as low as possible, low enough that a teacher could go onto DonorsChoose and raise

113
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:36,500
enough money. We wanted everything ready to go. Here's how you set up. Here's what you

114
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:43,500
buy. Here's the curriculum that you can choose from. We wanted to start to move kids out

115
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:49,860
of scratch by eighth grade, start to move them into Python, and we wanted subject area

116
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:56,860
integration so they had time during the school day to do the work. So this is our big idea.

117
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:03,860
Well, what did we learn from this idea? This is the first thing we learned. This is a slide

118
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:12,500
from the official Raspberry Pi Foundation teacher training called Pi Academy. So this

119
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:19,820
is really part of Raspberry Pi's ethos is that first attempt in learning or failure

120
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:26,860
is common and desirable. It's part of the learning process. And as experienced educators,

121
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:35,740
we thought that shouldn't be part of our process. But if you're dealing with a Raspberry

122
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:42,820
Pi, if you're dealing with people, students, and classrooms, this will be part of the experience

123
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:50,020
and that's a good thing, just like it is if you're a student using the Raspberry Pi.

124
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:57,340
So what bumps did we encounter? The first was in curriculum. I want to thank Chantal

125
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:04,340
Mason. You can tweet her. She is the one who developed all of our open source curriculum.

126
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:11,100
So she learned some things. Teachers weren't able to take what they saw on the internet.

127
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,300
There's all these projects for Raspberry Pi. There's endless education resources. Teachers

128
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:21,620
weren't able to take that and then make it into something that they knew what to do with

129
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:28,620
in the classroom. They were unable to do that because they needed a format that fit into

130
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:35,740
their schema for what education is. So we formatted our lessons to look similar to what

131
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:43,060
they might see if they planned a unit or a lesson plan. It's a little bit different because

132
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:48,060
it needs to be flexible for everybody, but we wanted to cue some of the things that they

133
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:54,060
would recognize so that they knew what to do with the information. Next, we did not

134
00:15:54,060 --> 00:16:01,060
reinvent the wheel. We relied heavily on Raspberry Pi's open education resources and we used

135
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:08,420
that as the foundation and then we built on top of that. Finally, Chantal really dug

136
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:19,780
into the standards. A lot of us want to approach it as, oh, here's what I wish I would have

137
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,740
learned. Here's something really interesting. But Chantal started with what do the teachers

138
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:33,780
need to teach and can I understand where the kids are actually at? She was able to really

139
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:41,500
dig in and because of that, she created subject integrated lesson plans. For example, in science

140
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:50,700
class, they study urban farms and they make an urban farm and monitor it with a Raspberry

141
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:57,700
Pi. In English language arts, they are studying propaganda and so they read a book and they

142
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:08,740
create a series of podcasts that are presented in a Raspberry Pi radio project. This is part

143
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:17,420
of their assessment for their ELA class. That was pretty easy to overcome. Once we recognize

144
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:25,420
the problems, we could address them and we are able to come up with good curriculum solutions.

145
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:34,780
On the other hand, peripherals and networking. I would say that there are perhaps no great

146
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:44,500
choices in this area. We still have not solved this problem. This one is ongoing. The first

147
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:50,420
thing that I learned is to be really clear about your program goals and base the choices

148
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:57,420
for this on those goals. For us, we did not want to use laptops and SSHN because we wanted

149
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:09,500
kids to have the tangible hardware software experience. We want them using the Pi and

150
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:16,500
seeing the Pi. We ended up using Pytops which obscured our goal of using and seeing the

151
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:26,740
Pi. On the other hand, it solved some of the schools problems. Where are we going to put

152
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:33,740
30 more monitors in our school? There are several options. We have not found something

153
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:40,740
that works for both the school and the students yet. We are working on it. We also learned

154
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,260
that it is not just us. Every time we hit a bump in the road, we thought that we just

155
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:52,420
cannot use the Raspberry Pi that well. We must not know exactly what we are doing. What

156
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:59,420
we actually found out was that with certain products, there were user design issues that

157
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:05,220
were causing these problems on a wider scale. It was important for those companies that

158
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,220
we went to them and told them what was happening in the classroom because to go back, if it

159
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:17,220
does not work in the classroom, it does not work. This does not apply to most open education

160
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:25,120
resource projects, but I just want to touch on it because there are some programs that

161
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:32,120
are open. Scheduling and budget are big obstacles in schools. If you are creating some kind

162
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,520
of open education resource just because what you created is free does not mean it is free

163
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:46,520
to implement in the school. Thinking about what are the costs, a lot of times there are

164
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:53,520
cost tradeoffs. Schools can work harder to have something for free or pay less money,

165
00:19:54,040 --> 00:20:00,420
but they may need more in-house expertise than they have. Again, you might have a solution

166
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:05,240
that works for you, but it is not going to work within the school day for the teachers

167
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,320
who are there. Just something to think about. We also found it was great for teachers, more

168
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:18,320
than one teacher to do this, to have a cohort that is in it together at the school. Lastly,

169
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:25,160
we found teacher training is important. Nobody was going to use our curriculum unless we

170
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,080
could figure out some type of training. Because we want this to be a program that is accessible

171
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,400
and ready to go, we are looking at what is the least amount of training? What is the

172
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,920
most accessible way for them to get the training? We cannot send every middle school teacher

173
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:47,920
in New York City to Pi Academy. How can we give them enough training to implement this

174
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,840
program so that their students can have the physical computing experiences? We are looking

175
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,000
at lots of different options. Can we get it down to a one day thing that is offered throughout

176
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
the boroughs? Can we do it online? Can we use some of Raspberry Pi's online resources?

177
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,320
This is an area we are also still exploring. We have also realized teachers need to do

178
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,880
the projects. They need to play and they need to master the materials. Many computer science

179
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:28,880
educators are new. They are new to computer science even at the high school level. They

180
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:35,080
are learning along with their students. In our trainings, we really focus on them building

181
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:42,080
confidence and building their skills. Moving forward, we did learn that students can do

182
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:50,320
this despite all the bumps and obstacles. Teachers without the official training can

183
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,720
do this. We have subject area middle school teachers who have never touched code before

184
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,720
having their kids use Raspberry Pi with Python to build these projects. They can do it and

185
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:08,720
they enjoy it. That told us that it is worth dealing with all those failures that come

186
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,780
up. It is worth dealing with the bumps because the kids get an experience that they would

187
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:20,780
not get with an online tutorial, which for them was the alternative. Iteration is really

188
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:29,560
key. You just have to keep trying and keep addressing problems as they come up.

189
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:35,160
I want to break this apart and abstract it out a little bit and think about some principles

190
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:42,160
that we can apply to every open source education project. The first concept is that content

191
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:51,240
matters but not at the expense of logistics. What does that mean? I am not saying forget

192
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,440
about the content. It does not matter. I am saying if you have the greatest content in

193
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,940
the world, if schools cannot figure out how to implement it, students will not get to

194
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:08,940
use it. Next, you should never assume that your user looks like you or thinks like you.

195
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:18,340
Refuse the temptation to design for your younger self. Access counts. It is so easy as an educator

196
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:27,020
for me to think about myself when I was in seventh grade. How did I learn? What would

197
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:34,340
have been fun for me? That does not work. Every educator learns pretty quickly. It is

198
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:41,940
very tempting. User-centered design, thinking about your audience and what will work for

199
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:48,940
them. Most of them are learning programming in a non-traditional environment, the traditional

200
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:55,940
way of learning Python, which is what I did. I went online by myself. I worked through

201
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:02,940
learn Python the hard way and I was off and running. That is not going to work for our

202
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:09,940
students in classrooms of 30 people each with no background. Access counts. That means two

203
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:16,940
things. That means access to the curriculum for students with disabilities, but it also

204
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:25,860
means to think about what access they have to technology. Do not assume every student

205
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:32,860
has a computer. How else can they program? It is not ideal, but there are apps for programming

206
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:39,860
Python on your phone, on a tablet, in the browser. There are all sorts of options, so

207
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:49,220
think about alternatives and do not assume that kids have access to these tools. Just

208
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:56,580
accept that you are a UX designer. I am sorry. If you have a blank white page full of information

209
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:09,540
of text filling the page, that is not going to work. A teacher is not going to know what

210
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:16,540
to do with that or how to pick it apart. If you want your projects to be used, you want

211
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:23,580
to think about design. Testing in an education environment is better than having a kid related

212
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:30,580
to you test it. If your fourth grader can do it, it does not matter. Can a fourth grade

213
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:37,140
class do it? Why do not you go try? Go see. We can talk about different ways how you can

214
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:43,580
build relationships with schools to do this testing. If there are too many Python in jokes,

215
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:49,780
it is probably a bad idea because they exclude new users. If you think it is too obvious

216
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:56,780
to explain, but explain it anyway, it is probably a good idea because it was not obvious. Your

217
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:03,780
contributors need guidance, especially in these areas. I love Python in jokes, but my

218
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:13,140
students do not. They really do not get Monty Python. I wish they did. They really do not

219
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:20,300
care once I explain it to them. When students and teachers read that, they feel like outsiders

220
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:28,300
because that is another thing other than the content they need to decode and figure out.

221
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:35,820
We want to be welcoming with the materials. Also, if you think it is obvious, if you think

222
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:41,500
you went all the way back to the very beginning, stop and go three steps before that because

223
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,260
they do not know. A lot of teachers, even high school computer science teachers, have

224
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:53,460
never used Git. You have a project up on Git that is amazing and they do not know how to

225
00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:00,460
use it. These are just some things to think about to make sure that your projects work

226
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,580
and letting your contributors know, giving them some guidance so that you are not alone

227
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:13,580
in making it work. Again, if it does not work for the intended user, it does not work. You

228
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:20,580
will fail and it will still be worth it. This work is so important. We have a huge need

229
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:31,500
right now in computer science education for projects, for collaboration between educators

230
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:38,500
and people in technology. There is a lot of curriculum out there, but it is not all great.

231
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:44,020
Your contribution can make a huge difference. Even if you make some of these mistakes, it

232
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:51,020
is still worth it. Finally, resources that exist are better than resources that do not.

233
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:58,380
So please, if you have an idea, do it. Even if it is not perfect, resources that can be

234
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,780
found are better than resources that cannot. If you have an idea and you do it, how will

235
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,740
you get it out to teachers? How will they find you? Resources that can be found and

236
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:15,740
used by your target user are even better. Let us do more of that. I present to you the

237
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:24,140
Zen of Python Open Education resources. Sorry. Write it down quickly.

238
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:40,780
I could go back to it during the Q&A. What are four takeaways that you can use today

239
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:54,700
during your sprints? First, think about how you can create templates or guidelines for

240
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:00,020
your contributors. How can you educate them in this area so that you can bring in the

241
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,420
widest amount of contributors and they can contribute in a meaningful way? How can you

242
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:11,420
give them guidance? One idea I have for my project is to use GitHub pages to create a

243
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:20,620
template and let contributors know that they should use the template to submit their projects

244
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:28,180
for our open source project. Next, bring on educator advisors. Or if you

245
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:35,180
are primarily a group of educators, bring on advisors who are Python developers who

246
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:42,700
are in the industry. If you are primarily in technology, bring on educators. Let us

247
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:49,140
work together. Next, let us start turning these educational materials into living documents.

248
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:55,900
They are anyway. Teachers virtually cannot take something off the internet and then just

249
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:01,780
turn it around and use it at face value in class. They are already having to make changes.

250
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:08,780
Let us make that part of our culture. Let us start taking pull requests. Let us start

251
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:18,180
making things live and taking contributions. Next, whenever you can, test in a classroom.

252
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:26,180
If you can plan for that during your sprint, that is great. That is it. Thank you for listening

253
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:34,780
today. Please contact me and keep the conversation going. I did write a book this year. If you

254
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:42,060
are interested, it is there. If you are not, no big deal. I would love to take questions.

255
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:50,060
I am just going to flip back here since everyone wanted that one. Yeah.

256
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:19,060
Sure. Actually, it is much easier to use Scratch because Scratch is available in so many different

257
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:32,260
languages. There is a drop down of like 40 languages. You can pick and it switches the

258
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:39,260
blocks to that language. Python does not have that. We do not even have documentation in

259
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:45,980
a lot of languages, let alone documentation for a middle school student. A lot of times

260
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:52,980
we are differentiating with Scratch. Another thing is we use an approach called trans-languaging

261
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:59,780
and also pairing that with something called literate programming. An example of literate

262
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:06,500
programming is where a student might describe what they want to do and start to, they might

263
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:13,500
ask a question like, how can I tell a story about X with Python? Then they might start

264
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:22,660
writing it. They might start writing how they are doing it. Then they gradually start writing

265
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:29,980
it in what they think is pseudo code or in pseudo code in using commands that they think

266
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:35,740
might be in Python. It is okay if the command does not actually exist. Then we take that

267
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,420
and we look at those commands even if they do not exist. We talk about that and we talk

268
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:46,420
about what could that be in Python. There are some great people, Chris Hoadley and Sarah

269
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Vogel at CUNY and Columbia who are doing research on teaching computer science to students,

270
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:59,140
to English language learners. They are doing this research and have shared it with us.

271
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:04,620
That is my source on that. I would also love to learn from you since you have been doing

272
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:11,620
it with kids in the field. I will. Yes?

273
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:18,620
I have a kid who has done a lot of research on computer science. I have failed a lot of

274
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:32,620
times to do Python. How do you approach them? What are the good things that you have found?

275
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:41,620
That is a great question. It is hard. There are lots of solutions online. There is not

276
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:49,140
a lot of research to show us what actually works. There are a lot of attempts at solutions.

277
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,740
One of those is the company that I used to work for, Codestars, that lets you drag a

278
00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:01,740
block over. It turns the block into Python once you drop it in and then it asks the students

279
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:09,060
to modify the Python. That uses an approach that is called use remix create that is research-based

280
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:20,620
in computer science education. We do not know that that actually works for transitioning

281
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:27,620
students. Trinket has the Python blocks and then Python. We do not know if it works. It

282
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:35,620
is worth a try. I think finding something that is motivating and interesting for the

283
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:41,660
students and especially because he is not in a classroom. He is working with you. Something

284
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:48,660
that is personally motivating a project he wants to do to start figuring out Python.

285
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:04,620
I thought it was just middle school students in elementary that the hardware made a difference

286
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:13,500
for micro bits and Raspberry Pi. When I go to SIGC, the special interest group on education

287
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:21,740
of the ACM every year, I hear graduate professors talking about how crazy their students went

288
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:26,900
for Raspberry Pi because there was something magical about holding it and touching it and

289
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:34,020
improve their pass rates. It is not just young kids. It is everybody.

290
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:41,020
I have found that school librarians are often on the forefront of this type of work and

291
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:48,020
not just computer science but especially digital making. I mean just librarians have a history

292
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:55,020
of leading the maker movement in this country. I do not see why they should be leading it

293
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:11,940
in schools. Also, oftentimes in middle school, it is not just the students who are leading

294
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,820
the maker movement in this country. I do not see why they should be leading it in schools.

295
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:22,780
Also, oftentimes administrators feel that is a good place for their digital resources

296
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:27,580
to fit in. The librarians are already managing a bunch of digital subscriptions and things

297
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:34,080
like that. We have school librarians also managing all the robots and being the expert

298
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,620
on the different robots and having students come in. Then the library becomes the place

299
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:46,220
where they can come to figure things out and to get extra help outside of their computer

300
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:53,220
science class. I do not know if that answers your question. Great.

301
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:17,400
Cor racks, these are all the resources they can learn and interest in or just go to.

302
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:57,760
Absolutely, you hit the nail on the head. That is a tension that will always exist and

303
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:06,100
it is so true what you said. So first I just want to point out that by starting to incorporate

304
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:12,620
computer science education during the school day at every grade level we are already making

305
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:20,140
we are already part of one of the most massive systemic changes in public school education

306
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:29,220
in the last century. So that's a big deal and that's a huge amount of change for our

307
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:36,580
public school system because as you were saying change is not easy and the culture is not set up

308
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:47,700
for innovation and learning through failure and building and making and experimenting. So that

309
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:56,740
said there's a couple different approaches that I take one as a coach I try to create that space I

310
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:04,060
let administrators know this is not a tested area so this won't be part of the evaluation of

311
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:12,700
the teacher. The other thing is that we find that as we train computer science teachers to have this

312
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:20,340
mindset it is starting to become contagious in the rest of the school. So I'll see a ninth grade

313
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:26,580
classroom that is it's a computer science classroom and the other teachers in the school all know

314
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:32,620
that that's where the kids go to learn how to use resources how to problem-solve independently

315
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:39,340
and it's they've sort of discovered that that teacher is helping them with all of their work

316
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:45,140
because of the open problem-solving that's happening that wouldn't normally happen in the

317
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:53,100
other rooms. In a kindergarten class I was in last year the teacher said to me this is the only place

318
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:58,620
the students get to practice cutting they didn't know how to use scissors they don't get to practice

319
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:05,620
and I said if that's what that's a great use of computer science time let's keep doing that. So I

320
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:11,300
think individual teachers are making change you know as they're creating this environment within

321
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:18,580
their classrooms and to some degree because it's still not tested you know we have some protection

322
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,740
for that we'll see what happens in the future.

323
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:58,860
Paraprogramming does there's research there's a lot of research to back that up. Paraprogramming

324
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:07,980
does improve performance and improve participation from girls specifically. Flipped classrooms the

325
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:18,900
jury's out that can create an access issue it works often in maybe a middle-class school environment

326
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:25,980
it doesn't work all the time for everybody so it just depends on the learners but I would say the

327
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:32,540
jury's kind of out on that. Thinking about children where they are developmentally is very

328
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:40,020
important. I kind of rearrange the way that I teach Python to them I start I think about math

329
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:47,260
and math we do concrete representational abstract and I use the same principles for Python how could

330
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:57,860
we start with objects both objects as a programming construct and literal manipulatives objects and how

331
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:05,900
do we move and build from there. So with Python we often actually start with something a little more

332
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:14,020
advanced an object sometimes a spray if we're using Pygame or something similar and then go from there

333
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:32,500
rather than just starting with numbers strings etc. I personally don't at Cornell Tech I work with some

334
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:40,420
graduate students who are trying to and it's been really difficult it's difficult to teach to teachers

335
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:46,540
and it's more difficult to teach to students it's a great problem for us to work on and solve together.

336
00:42:46,540 --> 00:43:09,940
Yeah so in many places there is a university that's facilitating computer science work

337
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:21,420
in K-12 so that's a good place to start trying to find who are the people in my area that are maybe

338
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:28,300
researching CS education there's often somebody in a CS Ed department or an education department

339
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:36,340
who's doing that and they're often looking for practitioners people who want to be part of that

340
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:45,020
and do related work so that's one way I don't think there's an easy answer to this because again it's a big

341
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:56,780
unsolved problem I've had I actually met somebody at PyGotham years ago he said I'm really excited

342
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:03,020
I want I want to do this and I said okay just you know get to know a teacher and go do it a year later

343
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:09,180
he was like I've been working in a classroom for a year with a teacher just as a volunteer on his own

344
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:18,060
I think that's really rare there are programs like volunteer programs like TEALS which is a national

345
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:24,060
program where software engineers can volunteer in the classroom and work directly with teachers and

346
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:28,380
I think that's a good place to start and then you build the relationship with the teacher maybe they

347
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:34,580
want to continue work together and contribute something maybe you could do a small project just

348
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:41,780
by if you have a child approaching their teacher hey can we try this in your classroom so there's

349
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:46,740
different options I don't think there's a ready solution yet but if you have initiative and you

350
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:53,460
want to start building those bridges it's a great idea one more thing it could be going to educator

351
00:44:53,540 --> 00:45:01,020
technology educator meetups in your area and asking who's interested yeah

352
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:05,860
yes

353
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:26,020
she just said public school public libraries have a good in with many public school systems

354
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,260
thank you yes

355
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:45,460
okay yes

356
00:45:53,460 --> 00:46:03,900
mm-hmm so specifically for students who are blind or low vision there is a learning language called

357
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:11,340
quorum that is made specifically for those students also I would direct you for students who

358
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:20,100
death who are deaf deaf kids code is an organization that focuses on that access

359
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:26,660
computing out of the University of Washington focuses on accessibility and CS education but

360
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:33,860
primarily students who are blind or low vision or have a physical disability my area of study

361
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:39,740
is students with invisible disabilities so that might include a learning disability autism spectrum

362
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:48,540
disorder ADHD emotion and behavior disorders which do affect learning so everything in that

363
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:56,900
realm and we've found so if you're familiar with Seymour Pappert in the history of computer science

364
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:04,620
education it's based on the idea of constructivism and what he also calls constructionism which is

365
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:14,860
building to learn but we've found for those students they need help accessing constructionist

366
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:25,700
activities so we have a philosophy of supported construction constructivism so what that means

367
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:34,700
is we scaffold the process for students we focus on all of their executive functioning skills we

368
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:41,780
help them set goals we help them plan we help them how do you break down a project how do you

369
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:48,860
plan a project how do you figure out steps all of those things we scaffold to start to teach them

370
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:54,460
how to do this so that they can have access to these more open-ended projects we want to start

371
00:47:54,620 --> 00:48:00,220
with direct instruction but we don't want to leave them at direct instruction because

372
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:08,220
then they wouldn't be able to access the richer learning experiences though they need that

373
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,220
direct instruction to start.

374
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:54,780
Excellent if you couldn't hear he was saying there are ways to configure the screen reader to read indentation in Python for

375
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,220
programmers who are low vision or blind thank you.

376
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:09,820
Cool.

377
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:15,620
Yep.

378
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:27,660
So this was part of the problem we were trying to address with the Raspberry Pi in a Box program

379
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:53,660
because we were running into these problems with just doing things in the browser and we wanted to move them out of that we couldn't afford to buy laptops for the school so we said okay let's try with Raspberry Pis so that's one way there are different options I mean I think just using the best tools in the browser that you can

380
00:49:53,660 --> 00:50:03,660
is probably the most realistic unless you can you know influence school budgets etc.

381
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:21,660
A lot of times though if you are in a position to advise administrators on their tech purchases we have been advising them to purchase laptops instead of Chromebooks they don't understand why so they really need education on why that's important

382
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:28,660
and an explanation of how it will benefit their students.

383
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:47,660
Yeah.

384
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:59,660
So how do you I mean so what is your suggestion to Google or an industry or tech partner who is working with the school what can I take back?

385
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:04,660
Do you mean in the context of giving Chromebooks?

386
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:15,660
I mean I would say so for when I think about Google I think about Google CS First which we use with students.

387
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:26,660
So thinking about applying some of these things to CS First and the open education resources that Google puts out there.

388
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:46,660
So for example I know they've done a lot of testing in schools and it solves some problems for example it's not like the tutorials where the students just do the thing they're told and then they're not able to really retain it they have to take in some information and then apply it to their project.

389
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:53,660
But then they also get lost they don't know where they are what to do next they need education for like how to use the interface.

390
00:51:53,660 --> 00:52:14,660
So I would say just talking with teachers and being having the engineers themselves go into the classroom is a great start not just you know somebody on the customer service side but the engineers who are making decisions about the product.

391
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:23,660
And oh and then just also to talk to somebody to bring in an expert to talk about accessibility as well.

392
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:38,660
Yeah.

393
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:50,660
Yeah well part of the reason is if we look at the K12 CS framework we have a lot of curriculum related to the strand about programs and programming and algorithms.

394
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:57,660
We don't have a lot of curriculum related to the strands about computing systems and networks in the internet.

395
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:09,660
And the people who are sort of running the CS framework they are actually looking for curriculum when they talk about alignment they don't mean oh you're aligned to this one area.

396
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:15,660
They mean you hit on everything in our framework.

397
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:25,660
So that's a huge need that needs to be filled and I think that's part of it.

398
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,660
Hi.

399
00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:14,660
Yes.

400
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:36,660
Yes.

401
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:42,660
I have not. That's a great idea. That's actually part of.

402
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:48,660
So today during the sprint the mini sprints.

403
00:54:48,660 --> 00:55:09,660
Part of my sprint is about doing some of these things building some of these templates and one of the projects is starting the framework for a database that will eventually become a guide for non educators to be able to look up standards and understand them.

404
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,660
I think that's a ways off.

405
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,660
I definitely haven't seen it for.

406
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:29,660
I haven't seen it for non educators and where the places that do have this kind of thing definitely don't have computer science standards as part of their database.

407
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:51,660
So.

408
00:55:51,660 --> 00:56:10,660
Exactly and so somebody in technology I feel like a big problem is it's not just finding the local CS standards that apply to you because it's different for every state and it can be different for different classes and grade levels where you go to even look to find these sets of standards.

409
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,660
Right. Are they getting a CSC?

410
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:14,660
Is it an AP course?

411
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:20,660
Is it you know in a state that has adopted CS standards?

412
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:33,660
In addition to that like you're saying they don't have time during the school days so many of them will want to do it as part of another subject area and then you need to find and interpret those standards for that subject area.

413
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:55,660
So it would be amazing to see a project that helps people in technology to not just find the applicable standards for their projects but that sort of interprets it for them that helps them to understand how that fits into their project.

414
00:56:55,660 --> 00:57:05,660
So if anyone wants to brainstorm about that please join our mini sprints.

415
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:19,660
Yeah.

416
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,660
Oh awesome question.

417
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:25,660
He asked about what role do I see for para educators.

418
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:30,660
Are you so it's there are different terms in different states.

419
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,660
Will you just clarify what you mean.

420
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:57,660
Do you mean like a para who's a teaching assistant or a para educator who's like running an informal learning program out of school.

421
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:00,660
Okay.

422
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:01,660
I see.

423
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,660
Okay.

424
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:10,660
So it's not in New York a para educator is somebody who assists specifically with students with disabilities in the classroom.

425
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,660
That's not what you mean right.

426
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:19,660
Yeah.

427
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:20,660
Okay.

428
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:21,660
Awesome.

429
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,660
But in the classroom.

430
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,660
Yeah.

431
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:31,660
So this is something well specifically to para educators who might help students with disabilities.

432
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:35,660
I've done research with my Israel related to this.

433
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:43,660
She has a guide up which I'll have to share.

434
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:46,660
I don't know where it is exactly.

435
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:59,660
She has a guide up online in her lab about how to help para educators to teach CS and how to train them and how teachers can work with them to be more effective.

436
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,660
And I think a lot of the same principles would apply.

437
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:13,660
So it's about training them even if the teacher has to be sort of modeling and training them on the fly teaching them emphasizing least to most intervention.

438
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:24,660
So meaning not having them jump in and do for the student not just para educators but teachers also have a tendency to oh they need something fixed.

439
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:27,660
I'm just going to jump in here and start taping.

440
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:38,660
We tell students not to touch each other's keyboards or mice or materials and we tell teachers not to touch students keyboards or materials.

441
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,660
And the same would be for para educators.

444
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,660

01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:05,660
I appreciate it.

446
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:11,660

447
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:12,660
