1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
and cannot see me.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,920
That's me on the left.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,940
Best wedding photo ever if you ask me.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,760
I'm a senior software engineer at Clover Health.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,820
Yes, we're hiring, let's talk later.

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,540
We also do engineering remotely, so.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,280
I've been interested in issues of representation

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,020
and diversity for like 15 plus years now,

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,140
and I love that my technical skills allow me

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,580
to affect how we go about doing things at Clover Health

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,680
to improve diversity and inclusion.

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,720
So you chose to be in this room,

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,160
you're gonna get one of them.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,480
You can follow me on Twitter at ZuckerPunch,

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,020
or if you are interested in the web app

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,540
I'm gonna show you later, DM me and I will send it to you.

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,080
I'm like too embarrassed about the code

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,440
to put it publicly on GitHub anywhere,

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,740
so it's not there, but if you wanna talk about

20
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,880
any of these things, let me know.

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,480
So the fact that tech is struggling to hire

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,640
or retain employees from diverse backgrounds

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,760
has been written about and discussed extensively.

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,760
The economic, social, and moral benefits of diversity

25
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,240
are also super well documented.

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,200
So why is it hard for well-intentioned organizations

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,920
to shift their demographics?

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,120
There are a number of reasons of course,

29
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,960
there's no silver bullet, but one that does not appear

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,360
to have been thoroughly discussed enough if you ask me

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,080
is the challenge of gathering and responding to data

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,960
about diversity within a company's hiring pool

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,640
and with their existing employees.

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,260
One hack day, I was involved in a few too many projects

35
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,180
and could only devote a token amount of time

36
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,420
to the one I was really interested in,

37
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,600
which was seeing if we could determine

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,040
whether we had sufficient diversity for any given role

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,560
to start interviewing candidates,

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,240
or if we needed to spend more time sourcing candidates

41
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,920
from diverse backgrounds for the pipeline.

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,140
So I accomplished an MVP in approximately an hour

43
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,720
once I had an API key and permissions,

44
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,040
which turns out that was the hardest part,

45
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,160
but it doesn't actually, if you take anything away

46
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,460
from this talk, let it be this.

47
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,980
It doesn't require a huge effort to make a big difference.

48
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,280
I'm a perfectionist, so I always used to think

49
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,040
if something's worth doing, it's worth doing well,

50
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,120
but also if something is worth doing,

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,600
it's worth doing poorly first

52
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,760
so that at least you have something, right?

53
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,800
So here's what you're in for.

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,240
In this talk, I'll walk through my MVP

55
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,840
indicating for each role,

56
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,280
whether it was sufficient diversity,

57
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,480
and then I'll talk about what our V2 was,

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,420
and I'll also address some gotchas and limitations

59
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,480
so that you don't have to make the same mistakes that I did,

60
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,920
and then we'll go forth on the what now, the glorious future.

61
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,760
Y'all in?

62
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,660
All right, let's do it.

63
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,120
Okay, so disclaimer, I put together this web app

64
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,560
for a Hack Day project.

65
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,120
This is my MVP.

66
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,280
The front end literally has no styles in it.

67
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,440
It was as bare bones as can be, but it works,

68
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,200
and that's what's important, right?

69
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,800
It's a simple Django web app.

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,480
It has one view.

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,680
It makes real-time API calls to greenhouse to fetch data.

72
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,880
Who works at a company that uses greenhouse?

73
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,640
Yeah, it's a pretty commonly used tool.

74
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,360
It has an API.

75
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,800
It's pretty handy.

76
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,520
There are other tools that you could use,

77
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,160
and I think those also have APIs.

78
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,320
This is just the one that we happen to have.

79
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,940
So this is pretty hacky code, and in production,

80
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,100
this would never fly with that nested for loop,

81
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,940
and performance of this code is terrible.

82
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,020
I'll show you more about that later.

83
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,500
But as a proof of concept, it's really effective

84
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,600
to give people a chance to see exactly how homogeneous

85
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,460
or diverse our candidate pool was at the top of the funnel

86
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,840
for any given role.

87
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,940
So this is my one Django view for the project.

88
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,860
It gets a list of jobs.

89
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,740
It gets, for each job, all the applications to that job.

90
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,820
And then for each application, it goes back to greenhouse

91
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,180
and fetches the EEOC data associated with that application.

92
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,060
It does a little number smushing,

93
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,260
which you'll see on a later slide,

94
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,540
and it renders a list of jobs with data

95
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,460
about how diverse the candidate pool is for each job.

96
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,820
So by the way, in case you were wondering,

97
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,540
EEOC is Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,

98
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,540
because I need to look it up every time.

99
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,780
The API calls are not super fancy.

100
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,340
They're just some hard-coded URLs.

101
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,420
I hit the Greenhouse's API and load the data

102
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,820
for the three endpoints.

103
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,300
You can see it's very abstracted, right?

104
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,460
And so this is where I add an application status

105
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,060
to a dictionary for each job.

106
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,700
It says, like, women tally,

107
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,700
and then disability status, there's a tally,

108
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,460
for race, for each of the races that there are,

109
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,380
there's a tally.

110
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,620
I anonymize and tally the number of applicants

111
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,460
who self-attest as belonging to a protected group

112
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,100
and display only aggregates for each role on one page.

113
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,420
Here's what it looks like.

114
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,300
Isn't it beautiful?

115
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,140
For any role, it says whether there is sufficient diversity,

116
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,020
and we'll talk about sufficient diversity later,

117
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,820
to move forward with interviewing candidates for the role.

118
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,020
So stylish.

119
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,260
Okay, so that was my MVP,

120
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,300
and that was, like, approximately an hour of time,

121
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,820
but I have visions for the future.

122
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,260
So what was our V2?

123
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,740
So normally, when you're hitting your website to get data,

124
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,740
you don't want people to have to wait 10 minutes

125
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,900
to see results, right?

126
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,900
That's not just me.

127
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,140
And when you first get all the jobs

128
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,540
and then the applications for each of those jobs,

129
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,580
and then the EEOC data for each of those jobs,

130
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,500
that's a lot of API calls.

131
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,940
This is what my terminal output looks like

132
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,900
when I make this request,

133
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,580
and it just goes on and on for pages.

134
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,660
Obviously, that's not ideal.

135
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,980
It'd be much better to collect the data regularly,

136
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,780
store it in a database where we can make fewer queries

137
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,820
faster by using table relationships, right?

138
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,700
So our first order of business is to sync new data

139
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,060
from Greenhouse to our database,

140
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,940
then there's no synchronous API calls to a third party,

141
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,060
and our page can load in a snap.

142
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,420
The next hurdle is how do we know what data is new,

143
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,100
how do we upsert changes

144
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,660
without getting everything fresh each load?

145
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,420
That's a problem for future Nicole.

146
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,620
For now, it's enough to drop and create every time,

147
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,180
and I cringe every time I say that,

148
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,940
but, like, it does the job.

149
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,100
Another thing we decided to do for V2

150
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,540
was to only show diversity stats

151
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,540
for candidates who have already exited the pipeline.

152
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,700
Otherwise, there's potential for a hiring manager

153
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,860
looking at this stuff to see a candidate

154
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,580
we're still evaluating and go,

155
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,420
oh, we already have enough veterans for this year,

156
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,380
let's not hire this one because that's illegal.

157
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,420
So the other thing we wanted to accomplish

158
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,700
was showing diversity at every step of the pipeline,

159
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,580
not just the top of the funnel,

160
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,740
from the recruiter's screen

161
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,900
all the way through offer acceptance,

162
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,380
and being able to slice data

163
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,620
to see the story for a particular group

164
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,580
or from a particular source

165
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,660
or from a particular recruiter.

166
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,060
So that's all well and great,

167
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,260
but there were some things that made this a little hard.

168
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,700
Be careful with people-sensitive data.

169
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,220
Where can you host it so that not everyone can access it?

170
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,820
We anonymize our data when pulling in information

171
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,860
about candidates using the API,

172
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,260
so we didn't store any information

173
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,540
that's personally identifiable for anyone,

174
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,980
just their EEOC stuff and their candidate ID,

175
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,700
which isn't identifiable

176
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,140
unless you have the Greenhouse API key.

177
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,500
Which brings up another thing.

178
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,380
Put your API keys in a private place,

179
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,620
and I'm not talking about a place

180
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,940
that's accessible to all of engineering.

181
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,820
Otherwise, even if you have your database stored

182
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,620
in a place where not everyone can access all of the data,

183
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,060
if they can access the API key,

184
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,860
they can get the data for themselves.

185
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,460
And they can slice and get information

186
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,020
from people who are currently in the pipeline

187
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,700
and make those illegal decisions.

188
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,260
I recommend you be sensitive

189
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,980
about who can see this information.

190
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,260
Maybe everyone should get the 10,000-foot view

191
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,540
at an all-hands.

192
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,260
That's the cookies.

193
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,660
But being able to view per-roll slicing on different tags,

194
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,220
you might wanna have limited access

195
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,900
to have people see things at a more granular level.

196
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,020
We decided to show results only for groups

197
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,220
of a minimum pool size or greater,

198
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,620
even though that meant that we get data

199
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,780
on a slower cadence than real time,

200
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,420
in order to give the pool size

201
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,220
a chance to get large enough for real anonymity.

202
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,180
Beware combinations.

203
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,940
Veterans who have a disability,

204
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,460
who are of a certain gender and a certain race,

205
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,460
is identifiable without anonymity.

206
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,820
If you wanna see musicians, that's one group.

207
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,900
If you wanna see the Muppets that are blue,

208
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,740
that's another group.

209
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,780
But if you're like, give me the blue Muppets

210
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,380
who are musicians, it's only that one,

211
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,860
and we all know who that is.

212
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,420
So don't show slices of multiple things at the same time,

213
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,380
unless that slice fits or exceeds a minimum pool size.

214
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,820
Plus Muppets.

215
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,580
Let me stress again how important our decisions were

216
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,740
about anonymizing data,

217
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,500
in addition to not allowing slicing

218
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,860
until a resulting group was above a particular pool size,

219
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,660
or not including, that part about not including candidates

220
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,100
who are currently active in the pipeline in your results,

221
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,460
is vital, because you don't wanna make hiring decisions

222
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,340
based on that information

223
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,660
that you're not supposed to make hiring decisions.

224
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,500
Like that example of,

225
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,900
we have enough veterans for this year,

226
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,700
we don't need to hire this one.

227
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,060
You don't wanna run into those legal ramifications.

228
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,740
I'm just an engineer, I don't have sufficient confidence

229
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,020
that my web app is bug free,

230
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,580
and there's absolutely no way

231
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,060
to get identifiable slices of data.

232
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,340
So only when those puppies have exited the pipeline

233
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,820
do we count them, unless you are super duper confident

234
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,580
that no one is gonna be able to like,

235
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,340
figure something out with your site.

236
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,820
Another problem we ran into

237
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,980
was that not everyone fills out this information,

238
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,100
it's sparse.

239
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,900
It's not available for referrals,

240
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,260
or for candidates that are sourced internally.

241
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,300
And even on the website,

242
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,580
not everyone chooses to fill it out.

243
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,300
Understanding why data is sparse

244
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,980
is clutch in figuring out what you can do to mitigate it.

245
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,980
And understanding what makes data sparse

246
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,860
has a lot to do with humans, turns out,

247
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,900
and solutions are usually specific to the particular group.

248
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,820
What works for employees is not the same

249
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,540
as what works to get more data from candidates.

250
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,060
Folks are often, especially if they don't know

251
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,900
your organization very well, like candidates,

252
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,980
they're often suspicious about what you're gonna do

253
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,300
with their information.

254
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,060
Will it be used against them in some way?

255
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,900
Whereas with your employees, you, I hope,

256
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,660
have a little bit more trust built up.

257
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,100
And sometimes there's no opportunity to collect data

258
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,260
from non-system inputs, like source candidates.

259
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,820
So try to, if you can, put processes in place

260
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,180
on the recruiting side to make sure

261
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,900
that you gather that information.

262
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,340
That's one way to handle that.

263
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,420
Another hangup was that sometimes the data

264
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,820
we need to collect by law doesn't match up entirely

265
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,100
with what we want to collect

266
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,220
or what people might be willing to divulge,

267
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,940
and we're limited by what it's legal to ask.

268
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,500
We need to decide what labels and groups to include.

269
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,260
Like for gender questions, what will our options be?

270
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,220
I know that there are non-binary humans

271
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,780
for whom the labels like male and female,

272
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,700
or like man and woman, don't really apply.

273
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,260
So how do you take into account that

274
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,620
when the government requires that you ask like,

275
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,740
male, female?

276
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,180
Also, making a survey is an art unto itself,

277
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,660
and it's possible to ask questions

278
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,940
and elicit a response that you did not intend.

279
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,980
Just so you all know, federal contractors are required

280
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,700
to request this information

281
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,900
for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

282
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,460
There's certain questions that you have to ask,

283
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,780
and if they don't match up with what you'd like to ask,

284
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,540
that leads to having like multiple surveys,

285
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,740
which causes survey fatigue.

286
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,180
There's also suspicion.

287
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,780
So find out what you need to do

288
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,340
and decide what the best balance is for you.

289
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,580
Great balance in terms of like survey fatigue

290
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,180
or like getting the questions answered that you really want.

291
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,700
So now we get to the part that I find really interesting.

292
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,700
What actually constitutes sufficient diversity?

293
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,500
Well, it turns out with zero diverse candidates in a pool,

294
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,180
you're obviously not gonna hire anyone

295
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,220
from an underrepresented group.

296
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,620
But according to a handful of studies

297
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,420
that the Harvard Business Review did,

298
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,420
even with one candidate from a minority group in the pool,

299
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,420
that person has like zero chance of actually getting hired

300
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,980
because of our preference for the status quo.

301
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,380
And there's this great quote in that article.

302
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,380
Deviating from the norm can be risky for decision makers

303
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,260
because people tend to ostracize people

304
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,660
who are different from the group.

305
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,060
So for women and minorities,

306
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,180
having your differences made salient

307
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,940
can lead to an inference of incompetence.

308
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,820
So if you're the only woman in a pool of finalists,

309
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,500
it highlights how she is different from the norm

310
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,100
and makes her inherently riskier candidate

311
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,060
and likely one that you won't go with.

312
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,420
But if you have even two people

313
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,860
from an underrepresented group,

314
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,100
they actually stand a chance of getting hired.

315
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,140
The odds of hiring a minority were 193 times greater

316
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,780
if there were at least two minority candidates

317
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,220
in the finalist pool,

318
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,300
controlling for the number of other minority

319
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,940
and white finalists controlling for pool size.

320
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,540
So like that is not inflated.

321
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,620
How impressive is that?

322
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,540
But two candidates, come on, that's a pretty low bar.

323
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,660
What we saw was if there was like

324
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,460
a relatively small pool of finalists,

325
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,700
like six finalists, eight finalists,

326
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,020
if you've got an applicant pool

327
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,540
for a role like software engineer,

328
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,860
you're gonna have far more candidates

329
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,700
to choose from.

330
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,820
So even if you have two people

331
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,300
from a minority group represented,

332
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,500
if there's a thousand people in the in group,

333
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,180
even if you put aside unconscious bias,

334
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,220
which totally exists and will whittle down

335
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,660
your diversity of your candidate pool

336
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,660
every step of the pipeline,

337
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,980
and if you put aside our status quo fix

338
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,300
of having two candidates,

339
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,780
you're still statistically unlikely to hire someone

340
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,780
different from the status quo

341
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,540
because you have two of them against a thousand other

342
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,620
probably equally qualified candidates.

343
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,940
So what can we do then?

344
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,580
I've got a crazy idea.

345
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,340
Why not go for parity with the eligible

346
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,340
labor force in the US?

347
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,940
Then at least if the top of your funnel is balanced,

348
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,660
you stand a greater chance of having those people

349
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,540
make it through your hiring process.

350
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,220
Not that it's smooth sailing from there,

351
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,100
we still need to institute systems

352
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,940
to limit the effective unconscious bias

353
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,620
in the rest of the hiring pipeline,

354
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,780
but at least it's a start.

355
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,860
This is part of a table of race and gender

356
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,540
in the potential labor force.

357
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,780
The base number is a thousand.

358
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,700
So for 2017, the total number of black women

359
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,540
in the workforce was 10.5 million

360
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,620
out of 17.5 million black women

361
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,220
who could have been in the labor force.

362
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,660
Not all of these people are qualified for every job

363
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,140
or even are interested,

364
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,660
but if we support programs that give training

365
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,100
and opportunities to underrepresented groups,

366
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,260
while we also try to get as close as possible

367
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,900
to having our pipeline represent the population pool,

368
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,020
someday those might converge and we'll get there.

369
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,300
But like, you know, aim for the stars.

370
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,100
We're doing this now at Clover Health.

371
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,660
So that glorious future that I talked about,

372
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,820
what does it look like?

373
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,580
I found out after I did my MVP

374
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,660
and when I was like halfway through V2

375
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,860
that there's actually a company

376
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,700
that does a lot of this for you,

377
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,060
and we ultimately decided to use them for the future

378
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,260
so that engineering hours don't need to support this web app,

379
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,620
this like hacky web app that I made indefinitely.

380
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,500
We didn't discover until we were like deep in V2.

381
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,540
So like, could we have done research to discover

382
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,780
that this company existed first and save ourselves some work?

383
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,140
Absolutely.

384
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,820
Would anyone have thought to Google it

385
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,700
before I made my MVP?

386
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,980
Probably not.

387
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,140
We found out about this company

388
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,380
through our diversity and inclusion manager

389
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,820
who joined right after I made my MVP.

390
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,100
So if you have diversity and inclusion folks at your company,

391
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,540
talk to them early.

392
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,300
This company is called Atypica,

393
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,300
and they'll, if you connect them with your recruit track,

394
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,820
or recruiting tracking software,

395
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,260
and give them like an API key or something like that,

396
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,100
they will look at your candidate pool

397
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,660
and do the slicing by role or by department,

398
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,980
by stage in the pipeline,

399
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,980
and they also do analysis to figure out

400
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,100
how to solve the sparsity problem of the data

401
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,900
so that they have like an 80 or 90 something percent

402
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,340
accuracy rate in determining gender and race,

403
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,500
and they don't do it just by like photo recognition

404
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,140
or like facial recognition,

405
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,340
so I think that's pretty cool.

406
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,580
If you don't have the budget to outsource

407
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,820
the way that we ultimately did,

408
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,780
the web app we talked about is perfectly usable though.

409
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,460
It probably requires a little further iteration

410
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,100
to handle the sparsity of data problem

411
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,940
that we were talking about,

412
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,940
but even if your time is limited,

413
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,340
the MVP is still better than nothing at all.

414
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,380
If you go this route,

415
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,060
make sure to include any DNI people at your company.

416
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,260
You'll need weigh in from HR and recruiting

417
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,180
as well as possibly legal,

418
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,060
but if you're willing to do the work,

419
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,340
most of the time folks are happy to give you their opinion

420
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,340
and send you on their way,

421
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,140
but don't try to do this without the knowledge

422
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,620
of what's legal without like consulting anyone.

423
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,260
Doing the problem solving without these people

424
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,620
would have been a huge mistake for me,

425
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,620
because I'm just an engineer

426
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,940
and you can't just tell me to implement a data ingest

427
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,940
because I'll do that,

428
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,580
but I should be part of the design of the thing,

429
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,580
but I don't have all the answers about like

430
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,460
what we should do, what we can do legally.

431
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,380
And also you can't just like

432
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,100
not include engineering in this task,

433
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,540
because obviously we all know that we have useful opinions,

434
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,900
and boy do we have opinions.

435
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,180
So the next challenge is how do you integrate data

436
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,900
for current employees with information

437
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,980
that's available for your hiring pipeline?

438
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,780
They're like two separate sources of information

439
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,860
and geez, but like reconciling them is like pulling teeth.

440
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,860
I just found out earlier this week though,

441
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,580
that Etipica now has like an API

442
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,340
that you can use for looking at information,

443
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,580
I think about like promotion and retention and stuff

444
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,660
for your existing employees.

445
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,980
So hey, maybe this problem is basically solved for me

446
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,700
and I just need to go check out their API documentation,

447
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,300
which I'm honestly likely gonna do on the plane home.

448
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,980
So now when you identify departments or roles

449
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,260
where there isn't representation across different groups,

450
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,540
the next step is going back

451
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,220
and sourcing from those missing groups.

452
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,220
If there's a big drop off at one step of the recruiting funnel,

453
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,820
investigate why people are leaving there.

454
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,300
So this is fake data, but this is like actually a report

455
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,300
that I pull from Etipica like quarterly.

456
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,460
So for one role, you see the counts

457
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,380
and the pass through rates for men versus women

458
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,540
for each stage of the pipeline.

459
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,220
At the beginning, you start with 100 men, 50 women.

460
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,100
It's not representative of the population,

461
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,900
but it's not awful either.

462
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,180
But in the application and resume stage,

463
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,300
50% of men make it through,

464
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,780
but only 20% of women make it through.

465
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,340
So it looks like you need to take a look

466
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,940
at what's happening in your resume review stage, huh?

467
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,940
At the phone screen stage,

468
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,380
you have many more men than women, 15 and 10 respectively,

469
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,900
but they make it through at the same rate.

470
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,900
So that stack, that frame seems to be okay.

471
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,700
Then for the onsite,

472
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,900
you have 80% of men making it through,

473
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,300
but only 33% of women.

474
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,740
So you probably need to take a deeper look

475
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,460
at what may be happening during that stage.

476
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,220
And because I work at a great place,

477
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,500
everyone accepts their offer,

478
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,140
but wow, we lost the chance to hire women

479
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,060
at the resume and onsite stages.

480
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,460
This is hard, but it's really worth it.

481
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,500
Since this problem is one of people and systems,

482
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,940
it's inherently challenging,

483
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,860
especially if you're a person

484
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,020
who's at the apex of privilege in our society.

485
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,140
But do what you can.

486
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,580
It's worth it to even go 50% of the way

487
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,220
rather than not do anything.

488
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,500
From one perfectionist to another,

489
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,340
admit that you won't have it perfect.

490
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,420
Try to build process around data collection

491
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,860
wherever you can,

492
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,860
and please don't guess about people

493
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,900
unless it's required by law

494
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,500
or outsourced to a company like a Typica

495
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,900
that does it professionally.

496
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,500
They're less likely to mess up than a biased human,

497
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,100
even a well-intentioned one.

498
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,780
And if you are at the apex of privilege,

499
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,380
ahem, cis whitehead men,

500
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,580
you should involve people from underrepresented groups

501
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,580
to be involved in the process.

502
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,420
Listen to them,

503
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,260
because they know how things are gonna come across,

504
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,180
but please don't make them do the lion's share of the work.

505
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,260
My recommendation is to solicit their opinion early and often,

506
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,460
do some work,

507
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,260
show them what you did and ask for feedback,

508
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,820
but don't make them carry this whole boulder by themselves.

509
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,020
So these are just some examples

510
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,380
of what I have done at Clover Health.

511
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,020
There's a ton of other things you can do

512
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,460
to instrument your hiring pipeline

513
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,540
or measure changes in inclusion at your company.

514
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,980
Share out what worked and what didn't work for you

515
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,900
so that we as a community can learn from each other

516
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,700
and develop best practices.

517
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,860
There's no reason for the best practices

518
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,060
about diversity and inclusion to remain a secret.

519
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,380
I want this special sauce all over tech.

520
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:24,060
So this is me, and that's my dog Chloe.

521
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,460
You can follow her on Instagram, corgi in the front,

522
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,660
because her front legs are a little shorter

523
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,660
than her back ones.

524
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,460
And I work at Clover Health.

525
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,780
We are totally hiring.

526
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,620
Come work with me.

527
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,860
And like I said, we hire remote engineers.

528
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,900
The end.

529
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,200
woven

530
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,820
LE tomorrow

531
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,580
One minute for questions.

532
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,740
If you guys want to step up to microphones

533
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,460
and ask your questions please.

534
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,340
Nicole, why is your hair so good?

535
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,380
I don't know.

536
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,820
I was born that way.

537
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,740
I'm a natural purple.

538
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,460
So I have two questions.

539
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,760
First is have you considered tying diversity goals to things like compensation and bonuses

540
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,940
for the people in the recruiting team?

541
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,940
And also what are your thoughts on the benefits of standardized interviews in removing bias

542
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,780
from the interview phases?

543
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,780
My brain is a sieve.

544
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,420
Let's do one at a time.

545
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:35,160
The first one is tying compensation and bonuses to like how you do on these diversity stuff.

546
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:41,240
My company, we have a one-role, one-compensation policy, basically so that women and minorities

547
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,120
don't get underpaid in the first place.

548
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,600
So we don't have that.

549
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:53,900
It's a good idea, I think, if you don't have this policy to reinforce that people should

550
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,360
actually put their efforts toward this by putting your money where your mouth is.

551
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,920
I think that our top-level executives are going to be held accountable to these numbers

552
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,720
over time now that we can measure them.

553
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,800
And also for our internal employees, like retention and stuff like that.

554
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:19,520
If we see those numbers diving, I think the plan is to hold leadership accountable for

555
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,520
that.

556
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,520
So does that answer your question?

557
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:30,400
Kind of, but it's very easy to say people will be held accountable.

558
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
For sure.

559
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,720
It's hard for me to believe that people in leadership will be held accountable for things

560
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,320
like this because they generally aren't.

561
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:45,480
When people say held accountable, they never say how they will be held accountable.

562
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,520
This actually came up in all hands that we had a month ago or so where it's like, okay,

563
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:57,600
so we're making these part of our OKRs for the company, but what happens if we miss them?

564
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,440
I'm just going to be the one saying to our CEO or whatever, you didn't reach diversity

565
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
in the numbers.

566
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
You're out.

567
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,880
And honestly, we've only been doing this for a year or so, so the proof will be in the

568
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
pudding.

569
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,520
But I, as a relatively privileged human in this system, feel like it's my responsibility

570
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,120
to say, hey, we said we were going to hold people accountable.

571
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,040
What have we actually done?

572
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,120
And we'll see if it actually works.

573
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,680
I agree with you that 90% of the time people are like, yeah, we really care about this

574
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,320
stuff and people will be held accountable and then nothing changes.

575
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:39,680
But I personally intend to remind people of these promises and if they don't follow through

576
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:47,200
on them, then that is something I will absolutely agitate about because I feel like I'm fortunately

577
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,640
in a position where I don't have to worry about staying employed.

578
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,400
So I can afford to fight for it.

579
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Does that help?

580
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,000
What was your second question?

581
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,640
Using standardized interviews to help remove unconscious bias.

582
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
Yeah.

583
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:12,120
I actually gave a talk at Pi Gotham, I think, with James who was sitting up here a few minutes

584
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:18,520
ago and we talked about some of the benefits of anonymizing resumes, taking out information

585
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,960
that would let people figure out your gender or your race, like from name or from college

586
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,240
you attended or where age is concerned, like the years that you were doing something.

587
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,880
And I know that there are other tools out there that make the process even better for

588
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,440
the phone screen or the on-site or whatever where it basically removes the identifiable

589
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,920
information like voice recognition, but there's some things that we can't do like speech patterns

590
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,600
and stuff where I think that is still like the next frontier where we're not going to

591
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:57,520
be able to isolate bias from the hiring pipeline entirely until we get to some of those things.

592
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:04,880
But I do totally think that we should make it so that it is not abundantly clear when

593
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,560
you're interviewing someone what their background is.

594
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,160
We should at least try it and see how that goes because I fully believe that there are

595
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:19,160
qualified minorities and women and people with disabilities out there, I think we just

596
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,800
don't perceive them that way because of unconscious bias.

597
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:28,000
Thank you.

598
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,440
So you mentioned at the outside that one of the challenges you had was getting an API

599
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
key.

600
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,520
What were some of the things you experienced sort of working with HR at the outset just

601
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,360
convincing them that this project was worth doing and getting rolling with it?

602
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,040
Fortunately my HR folks are like totally on board with this.

603
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:55,360
I had to ask, I wasn't asking them to do anything except give me the key so that helps, like

604
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,440
it didn't require work on their part, although now they're like happy to take advantage of

605
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,560
the information that I can give them as it informs their process.

606
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,440
At the beginning I had to say, hey, I want an API key and here's the reasons.

607
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,600
They were like, okay, that's asking for a lot of access to greenhouse.

608
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,320
How are you going to protect it?

609
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,840
I had to say, well, I'm only going to get these pieces of information.

610
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,440
I'm going to anonymize it in this way.

611
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,400
Then they were like, okay, great.

612
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,560
There was a bunch of back and forth about, oh, it turns out I actually need this permission

613
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
also.

614
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,560
Can you add that to the key?

615
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,800
I have to give you a new key, whatever.

616
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,360
That is the part that took a while.

617
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,000
It wasn't actually convincing them to let me do this thing.

618
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,520
It was a hack day project, so it was my time.

619
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
Anyone else?

620
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
All right.

621
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,760
Well, oh, wait, one last one from the back.

622
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
This is not my personal opinion.

623
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
Just a disclaimer.

624
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,240
Are you playing devil's advocate?

625
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,240
Yes.

626
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,400
How would you respond to those folks that do say, for example, if minorities and women

627
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,280
are having a pay gap or a disparity where they become more necessary with jobs or various

628
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:15,480
other things, why don't we all just save the 2% or 20% or 18% compensation cost and hire

629
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,600
all the women since they're a bargain?

630
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
I don't believe that.

631
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
I just want to hear your answer to it.

632
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,440
Wait, are you saying that these people say we should hire more women because they're

633
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
cheaper?

634
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
Correct.

635
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,520
If there's a pay gap, then why isn't capitalism solving it?

636
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,960
Because capitalism inherently flawed system that we should burn to the ground.

637
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,960
Fair.

638
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,320
I put the pro-claimer first.

639
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
Not my personal opinion.

640
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:41,840
But also, honestly, I would probably send them to one of my like cis head white friends,

641
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,080
dude friends who are like ready to be allies.

642
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,640
Like, all right, I got this 101 question for you.

643
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,160
Like, I want to answer the 201 questions and let them answer the 101 questions.

644
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Okay.

645
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Anyway, thanks.
