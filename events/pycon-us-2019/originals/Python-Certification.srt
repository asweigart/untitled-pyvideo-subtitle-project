1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start off with two questions. Please raise your

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:13,040
hand if you are in K-12 education. Good. Excellent. Excellent. Raise your hand if you consider

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,860
yourself to be an activist in the Python community. Okay. Perfect. So what I'm going to talk about,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,660
I would argue, is of interest to both those communities and why they need to work together,

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,740
which is Python certification. I'm going to give you a specifically K-12 slant on that,

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:38,020
and Chomar will be following up with a broader look at certification. So real quickly, and

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,020
I'm going to, Elizabeth has given, I mean, I've permission to fail, so I'm going to deviate

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:50,060
a little bit from my slides, especially since I've been so inspired by the talks this morning,

9
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,460
and I think we need to have a conversation about that. So I've been a high school teacher

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,500
since 1991. I started teaching computer science in 1993. I've been active in the free software

11
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:08,420
movement and in the open educational resource movement for a long time, and I've loved it.

12
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,100
I'm a bit of a rebel, and I work for Arlington Public Schools, and they've kind of let me

13
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,100
do that, and so it's been fun to teach for all these years. I still love teaching. I

14
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,360
have 16 students here, and I've told them to mix it up, so please say hi to them, talk

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,400
to them. They're a little bit shy. They're kind of grouping together. I told them they've

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:34,400
got to get out and mix it up with you all, so please do that, and thank you for that.

17
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,800
So why do I care about Python certification? Well, I am a CTE teacher, Career and Technical

18
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,520
Education, that's what they call me, and beginning, I'm going to read this, beginning with first-time

19
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,960
ninth graders in 2013-2014 school year, requirements for the standard diploma shall include a requirement

20
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,960
to earn a career and technical education credential that has been approved by the

21
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,960
board. So it is now mandated for Virginia teachers, CTE teachers, to give certifications.

22
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,240
I have resisted this for years. I just tried not to do it because these things can be pretty

23
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:18,240
awful, and I'm kind of, now there are two Python certifications, and so I'm going to

24
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:25,440
talk about those. So there are some benefits I've seen to the certifications. They provide

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,360
a common measurable, I guess, measurement of skill, and they provide a common reference

26
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:43,200
point for curriculum development. So those are two potential positives. The cons, which

27
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,160
I personally felt for the longest time way outweigh the pros, are that they limit creativity

28
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:56,160
because they enforce standardization and mediocrity. I mean, seriously, you have a state mandate

29
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,920
and you've got to pass this test, and let me tell you, I heard so many innovative things

30
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,920
this morning about raspberry pies and interesting curriculum. It is dead in the water if teachers

31
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,920
are being told that what they have to do is get their kids to pass this Microsoft MTA

32
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,720
98-381 certification because their job depends on that, and as long as their job depends

33
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,280
on that, they're going to have to do that, and they're not going to hear all these other

34
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,280
cool things that they might be able to do. And also, the certifications have a real strong

35
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,320
kind of corporate bias, and for me, that's not the kind of thing I want to be communicating.

36
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:46,040
So within the Virginia Department of Education presently, there are only two Python certifications.

37
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,600
The first one has been around for a while. It's the one I mentioned. It's part of the

38
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Microsoft Technology Associate Exam, and it's called Introduction to Programming with Python.

39
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,760
The other ones have just emerged on the screen, I mean, on the scene this year. I actually

40
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,600
have now taken both of these two certifications, so I can tell you a little bit about them

41
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,120
if you're a K-12 teacher interested in my thoughts on it. It seems to be that Pearson

42
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,120
is developing a whole stack of Python certifications, and Cisco has been partnering with them, so

43
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:27,120
the Virginia DOE approves Cisco's test and Microsoft's test.

44
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,880
So I went looking on the web before I gave this talk and said, well, what is best out

45
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,360
there if you were going to do certifications? Not surprisingly, Dr. Chuck shows up on the

46
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,360
top, right? But none of these are the certifications. Well, there is this Introduction to Python

47
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,000
Absolute Beginner by Microsoft, and on edX I haven't seen that. I don't know if that

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,800
relates to their certification exam. My hunch is it doesn't, but I'll have to check that

49
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,440
out further.

50
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,460
So I'm going to go a little bit quickly through these slides to talk about what we might want

51
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,560
to do next, because I've only got a couple of minutes. So I did some research, because

52
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,240
this is all new. So now you have this thing called the Open Education, OpenEdge Python

53
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Institute. They're developing this exam, and then Cisco is using it. These are the three

54
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,240
certifications that they're going to be offering now. The PCAP was the first. I took the PCAP

55
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,560
back in October, and the others didn't exist when I was preparing the slides for this.

56
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,560
Oh, there's two more now. So I'm going to reflect on those. So the PCAP is fairly expensive.

57
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,520
So in fact, it's so expensive, our school system's not going to offer it, because we

58
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,800
have some deal with Microsoft where we can offer the other one, because we've already

59
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,160
paid for some package, and that's the one my students are going to have to take.

60
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:58,160
It does align fairly well with the solo learn course. I found this to be the least offensive

61
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,360
of the two exams. They're more like AP puzzle type tests. They're short. They're testing

62
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:13,040
the syntax of the Python programming language. I found it to be fairly challenging. I've

63
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,160
been a high school teacher for many, many years, but I learned some Python tricks in

64
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:25,160
preparing for it. So it was of the two the least offensive. This is not the one I'm going

65
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:32,720
to be giving. I have to give the MTA 98-381, because we can offer that unlimited times

66
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,720
for free already. That exam was horrible. I can't tell you enough about how it is a

67
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,440
lot of reading. It's not at all ELL friendly. I mean, I had students who should have known

68
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,920
Python fail that test, because you're driven through this time thing where you have to

69
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:57,160
answer a bunch of questions after reading droll text. And in fact, I describe it as

70
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,120
having an unintentional corporate drone bias in the theme of the thing. You know, you read

71
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,960
this, oh, you're the manager of such and such region, and you've got to, you know,

72
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,240
what high school kid's going to care about that? And then you answer some little question

73
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,240
about that. So that's really pretty awful. And that's what we're giving right now. So

74
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,160
in the interest of hacking that situation, because I went looking for, oops, let me back

75
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,360
up. So in the interest of looking for resources to help students prepare, there's tons of

76
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,000
them, but you have to pay for most of them. Everybody's commodifying their prep for this,

77
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,360
you know, exam that's required. And I've got a group of students who will be pitching

78
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:50,360
a mini sprint this afternoon. We've started to create our own power through Python certification.

79
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,360
So at least we can, yeah, we can make a problem out of together solving this thing that we

80
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,640
all have to do. It's not, my students are actually in a dual enrolled program that is

81
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,280
going to give them an associate degree in computer science when they finish school.

82
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,440
And now actually what I'm interested in after hearing Dr. Chuck is teaching his program,

83
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,800
right? I mean, what you laid out is pretty much what I'm already working on and a series

84
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,800
of courses all open source, we need a certification. So we need to find a way as the Python community

85
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,560
to have a certification that we have some input into, because we don't have any input

86
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,520
into this. And if we ignore this problem, and we have for a long time, we didn't want

87
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,400
anything to do with it, that was fine. But for me, I can't avoid it. I'm a public school

88
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:52,200
teacher, Virginia has mandatory K-12 computer science standards now. We have to teach computer

89
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,480
science all across the state from all across the grades, and this certification is part

90
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,720
of that. So having an approved certification that the Python community had some input into

91
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,720
would be such a wonderful thing, I think, for our community. And thank you very much.

92
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:23,080
I appreciated Jeff's comments. I'm going to elaborate on those a little bit, especially

93
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:30,080
toward the end. My name is Chalmer. I'll tell you a little bit about who I am and kind of

94
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,960
the role that I have in terms of certs and the types of certs that I've pursued, and

95
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:43,560
the things that I've seen in acquiring and looking at some of those certifications. I

96
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,440
work for a company called Booz Allen Hamilton. I do cyber security related things. I also

97
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,320
do a lot of data analysis and data science types of things. I do a lot of teaching. I've

98
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,800
taught in the collegiate field and in the commercial field. I teach in my client space.

99
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,000
I teach to people at Booz Allen Hamilton. I teach at meetups, et cetera, et cetera.

100
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,800
And I help run the education summit every year. I think this is my fifth year helping

101
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,620
to facilitate the education summit. I am a certification holder. I don't necessarily

102
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:21,620
say that proudly. I do have some. I am an exam author for certification exams. These

103
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,520
are some of the certs that I have. Again, none of these are particularly things that

104
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,440
I necessarily hold up proudly, et cetera. They're just there. Many of them I acquired

105
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:38,000
because either I got a chance to take it, my employer might have paid for it, or because

106
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,020
I felt like it might be a way to influence my resume. So the decisions might sway my

107
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:50,020
direction when I wanted to get a new job or take on a new opportunity.

108
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,360
Jeff mentioned a couple of certs that are out there. There is another cert out there

109
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,360
that is related to Python. It's the GPYC. The GPYC is a cert that is a certification

110
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,960
that is associated with GIAC, the Global Information Assurance Certification. They're

111
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:14,240
an organization that is focused on information assurance or cybersecurity. GIAC has a wide

112
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,920
variety of certifications that they offer. This one is the only one they have that's

113
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:25,360
related to Python. GIAC's sister organization, SANs, which stands for SysAdmin Audit Network

114
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,880
and Security, those folks offer a class that helps you prepare and get ready to be able

115
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,640
to pass the GPYC certification. Later on you'll be able to get the slides and the

116
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:43,640
URLs to get to some more details about these at the bottom of this slide in the small font.

117
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,320
The skills that are covered in the GPYC are a lot of the typical types of things that

118
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,360
you might see in any sort of Python class. How do you make executables? What are data

119
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,940
structures? All those kind of things. There is a focus or a nuance though to this class.

120
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,180
This class was intended for penetration testers, people who are doing vulnerability assessments,

121
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,420
people who have an interest in cybersecurity and information assurance. There is a bit

122
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:15,420
of a leaning toward that. Nonetheless, while learning those really cool cybersecurity skills,

123
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,660
getting your hacker on, if you will, you're also learning a lot of cool Python.

124
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:27,660
In terms of some of the details for this particular cert, the exam is proctored by Pearson VUE.

125
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:35,340
It is 75 questions, about a two hour exam. The cost of the test is close to $800. If

126
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:44,420
you wanted to take the SANS class, it's $6600 to take a six day class. A little bit of confession

127
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:54,940
time here. We're all amongst friends, so I'll tell you the truth. I worked for SANS. I worked

128
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:01,840
for JIAAC back in around 2010. I reviewed course content that was delivered in some

129
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,780
of the SANS classes. There were several of them. I authored exam questions. Back in 2010,

130
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:13,220
I had a very good view into how JIAAC went about creating questions that they used to

131
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:18,060
kind of assess people's skills. I do not currently work for them. I've not worked for them for

132
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:24,580
about eight years. I just want to get that out there and let you know that the next few

133
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:32,060
slides, these are my opinions. These are all buyer beware. I'll talk a little bit about

134
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:38,860
the pros of kind of the JIAAC certifications, et cetera. We'll talk a little bit about the

135
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:45,860
cons. Then we'll close off with, much like Jeff was talking about, how does the Python

136
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,860
community create a certification for the Python community that meets the needs that we have?

137
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:57,820
In terms of some of the pros for the JIAAC certification, they generally have a fairly

138
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:04,820
strong reputation. When I speak to people who are looking, say, to hire folks in the

139
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:10,820
cybersecurity field and they see a certification from JIAAC that tends to lend a certain amount

140
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,820
of weight, I don't want to characterize how much, but a certain amount, so that registers

141
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:21,820
on a resume to a hiring manager, those kind of things. The weight that they carry is often

142
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,340
a little higher than some of the certifications you might see from other organizations, so

143
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,860
they have a strong reputation in the community. Based on my experiences both in reviewing

144
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:37,380
the author content and in writing exam questions, I feel like they had a very high level of

145
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:44,380
quality in those exams. They put a lot of professional effort into the things like regular

146
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:50,180
and consistent review processes, multiple levels of review. I got many of my questions

147
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,180
kicked back like, hey, can we clean these things up in various ways? They use a lot

148
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:00,380
of psychometric types of evaluations to get a quantitative answer. Does this question

149
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,340
essentially address the types of things that you want to have addressed? They run them

150
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:12,340
through a whole series of test exams so that people who've already passed the certifications,

151
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,420
they'll take these new questions and make sure that those questions are answerable by

152
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:22,180
people who have the skills that we've already claimed that they had. The training content

153
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:29,180
is generally fairly spot on. In terms of the focus for this particular cert, because there's

154
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:36,380
that cyber security focus, that helps to bring somebody's resume a little closer to two different

155
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,940
skill sets, both of which are in high demand, the ability to automate and program, as well

156
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,860
as the ability to address things from a cyber security perspective. That extra focus on

157
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:53,860
cyber security could be a pro. It could be neutral. In terms of cons, the biggest con,

158
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:59,780
probably the cost. Jeff was mentioning some of the costs of the certs he talked about,

159
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:06,780
and there's a significant difference just for the cert, much less for the classes. I

160
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,600
have no recommendation here about, gee, you or your students should go out and get this

161
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,300
particular cert. I'm not going to say that it is a worthwhile thing. That's a decision

162
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,140
I'll let other people make. What I am interested in, and what we'll talk about here for the

163
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:27,500
last couple of minutes is, what makes a cert worthwhile, and if the open source community

164
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:34,500
pursues trying to build a cert that we want to stand behind, what should be included in

165
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:41,500
that? Certainly the class qualities that will help people prepare for a cert. I mean,

166
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,740
that's fundamental, and I think that's something that we can all get behind. Classes need to

167
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:53,100
be well designed. The learning experience should be high quality as well. The exams

168
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,940
themselves, if you are looking to create a certification exam, the exam must be relevant,

169
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:04,540
and it must have the backing of things like psychometrics. Can we check to see if the

170
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,220
question is a valid question, is it a reasonable question? Is it simply rote memorization,

171
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:15,020
or is it application? Is it assessment? Those kinds of considerations. Does the cert have

172
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:21,020
perceived quality? Again, if I'm looking at a resume and I see a cert by organization

173
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,920
X, or I see a cert by organization Y, and I feel that organization Y has consistently

174
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:33,120
delivered staff to me who have skills that are represented by that cert on the resume,

175
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,440
so a cert we produce must have perceived quality, and people must be able to see that cert and

176
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,040
go, ah, yeah, I know what's behind that cert, and I know what to expect when I bring that

177
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:50,040
person onto my team. There has to be some level of perceived return on investment. A

178
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,480
lot of the SAN certifications, those are actually funded by companies. Large companies will

179
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,380
go out and they'll pay money to send their employees to get a SAN certification, so those

180
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,200
employees could then be offered up to clients, et cetera, like we have people with these

181
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,000
certs, those kind of things. So if a company is going to invest in getting a cert that

182
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,400
this open source community comes up with, they have to have a sense they're going to

183
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,360
get a return on their investment. An open source is often very low cost, right, so that's

184
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:25,360
probably an easy bar to make, but it's definitely something we need to consider. And that's

185
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:31,600
the end of Jeff and I's essentially kind of foray into this conversation. I hope that

186
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,080
over the next couple of hours when we get into sprints and stuff, if folks have thoughts

187
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,960
or ideas, I'm sure Jeff and I would both love to hear those things. We'd love for you to

188
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,800
share with us what you feel ought to be included in certs, and hopefully as we as a community

189
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:51,640
over the next six months, 12 months, years, we can start to look at what does a cert mean

190
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,660
and what should be an assert, and what can we do to ensure that certifications that are

191
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:03,660
useful and meaningful to us and to our students can promulgate. And with that, my time is

192
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:11,400
about up, so I'll be around afterwards for questions.
