00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
Hello, everyone. Hi. My name is Brent Clements. I'm with Capital One. I'm a developer over

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,560
there. And this is about my fourth year I've been here. I've seen a lot of new faces here

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,720
at PyCon. It only shows how great the community is, how much it has grown over the past couple

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,000
of years, and quite frankly how far the language has come. But me being from Capital One, you

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,960
may or may not understand why Capital One is, why we're a sponsor, why we're here. And

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,480
quite frankly, we love the language. It powers a lot of our innovation at Capital One in

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:46,480
our open source projects such as Cloud Custodian and our customer facing projects such as Eno.

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,280
We support the community and we want to see the advancement of the language go forward.

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,120
And quite frankly, these are a lot of the same reasons I came to Capital One, because

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,000
we really truly do love the community and want to support it and see it move forward.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,960
We do appreciate the community helping us out in our own project and the ecosystem.

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,640
We're proud to be principal sponsors of the community, of PyCon, and look forward to seeing

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,640
you at future PyCons going forward. Do you want to welcome Eva, who's going to be giving

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,520
updates on the Python Software Foundation and presenting the Community Service Awards.

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,520
Thank you and have a great day.

16
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:39,040
Since I've been on stage already, I'll just do a quick intro. My name is Eva. I'm the

17
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,000
executive director of the Python Software Foundation. If you're interested in Python

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:51,400
community updates, please follow myself and the PSF Twitter. So let's talk about giving.

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,320
We gather at PyCon in similar events because of opportunities. These in-person events give

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,320
us opportunities to learn, network, collaborate, catch up with friends, make new friends, teach,

21
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:15,320
mentor, and so much more. Through these opportunities, we foster the growth of Python and make our

22
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:23,440
community stronger. Through these opportunities, in a way, we give back to Python. By registering

23
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:31,920
to attend, you're giving back to the community. Sponsoring the conference, instructing a tutorial,

24
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,160
presenting a keynote gives back to the community. All these forms of giving help our community

25
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:44,040
grow. The Python Software Foundation is the nonprofit behind Python and its community.

26
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:51,040
The PSF has grown into an organization that gives to its community through its programs.

27
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,480
This year, we published our first ever annual impact report. Here we see a snippet from the

28
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,480
report showing our program service expenses from 2018. Approximately 75% of our expenses

29
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,480
go towards putting on PyCon. Our next largest expenses are the funds that go to our grants

30
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:21,480
program, which totals 16%. As the PSF continues to grow, we also want our grants program to

31
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,480
grow. Our grant funds go towards events and supporting regional communities all around

32
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,480
the world. We want to continue supporting events and communities because they provide

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
those impactful opportunities that I spoke about earlier to folks not just here but everywhere.

34
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,300
In addition to providing our community that support, we want to increase the PSF's expense

35
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:51,560
budget for funding things like Python and education projects and dev sprints. We want

36
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:58,480
to have enough funds to help Python make it to the next level. Russell's keynote on Friday

37
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,120
really hit home for me because I felt like it addressed all the ways that the PSF can

38
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:10,120
support Python to keep it sustainable. At the PSF, we listen to what the community needs

39
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,360
and we want to deliver on so much of it. And of course, we can't deliver on everything,

40
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,960
and that's not the point here, but to even support core development, we need more funds

41
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,040
to be able to do that. Giving is what allows us to do that. A few days ago, the PSF launched

42
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,320
its first fundraiser of the year. Most people in this room have had their lives impacted

43
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,840
by Python one way or another. I'd like you all right now to think of those opportunities

44
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,920
the Python community has given you. With that in mind, I want you all to consider giving

45
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,920
back to Python so it can continue to positively impact the world. This year, we have two ways

46
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:01,920
to give to the PSF. One way is donating cash through the donate button on you can find

47
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,320
it through PyCon.us. The second is through a collaboration that we're lucky to have with

48
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,260
JetBrains. If you purchase a PyCharm license through this link that I put up, all proceeds

49
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:21,260
of those purchases will go to the PSF. Our fundraiser ends May 22nd. Please consider

50
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:28,380
giving. Part of the PSF's growth has included making decisions that strengthen our sustainability

51
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,340
so we can continue to support our community and our staff for years to come. We understand

52
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,500
the importance of diversifying our revenue streams so we're not solely dependent on

53
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,580
PyCon to sustain the PSF. Additionally, we decided that we need to have a financial reserve

54
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:53,740
for at least one and a half years of operating costs. In addition to financial responsibility,

55
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:00,140
we have addressed sustainability of our staff so we no longer have a bus factor of one.

56
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,420
We recently hired additional people to work on PyCon and our accounting team. When I started

57
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:12,420
back in 2011, it was just two of us. Now there are eight of us. I wanted to take this opportunity

58
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:20,180
to bring everyone on stage because everyone here should see the folks behind all the work

59
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:26,260
that the PSF does. Seeing names in emails and chats is nice, but putting faces to those

60
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:33,260
names is even better. PSF team, come on up.

61
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:42,420
Thank you.

62
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:12,460
So, this friendly face that you've been seeing, you know, years at this conference, especially

63
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:18,140
the last two years, has not only been the conference chair of PyCon for 2018 and 2019,

64
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:24,060
but Ernest is also the infrastructure director of the PSF. Ernest helps support our community

65
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,980
with infrastructure needs and problems. Additionally, Ernest manages all of the PSF-owned infrastructure

66
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:36,060
such as Python.org, helps maintain PyPI.org and us.pycon.org and many more.

67
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:43,660
Phyllis Dobbs joined us two years ago and is now leading our accounting team. Phyllis

68
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:49,980
is helping us ensure we have important policies and procedures in place as our nonprofit continues

69
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:56,980
to grow financially. Jackie Augustine joined us in September of last year and Jackie is

70
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:04,100
now the manager of PyCon and lead organizer. I am sure many of you have already interacted

71
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:11,100
with Jackie about registration and going forward you will see her involved in much more.

72
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:18,420
Betsy, Betsy Walaszewski has been with the PSF since 2015.

73
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:25,420
Betsy does an outstanding job providing sponsorship and fundraising support. Betsy did an incredible

74
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,420
job with PyCon sponsorship this year and she helped all of the sponsors that you all interacted

75
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:42,420
with in the expo hall with their logistics and needs.

76
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:56,020
Joe and Laura both joined us earlier this year. Joe, Laura, please step forward. Joe

77
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,060
and Laura both joined us to help with the accounting team. We are super grateful to

78
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:12,220
have their help with the financial aspects of PyCon and the PSF such as financial aid

79
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:19,220
and even at the PyLadies auction this year. Welcome to the team Joe and Laura. So, Kirby

80
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:30,140
Kaiser, please step forward. Now I am going to start crying. Kirby Kaiser has been with

81
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:41,220
PSF for 12 years.

82
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,660
Kurt is responsible for establishing the PSF's accounting system and helped pave the way

83
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:54,180
to where the PSF is today. Kurt is retiring this year and we all owe him a big thanks

84
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:01,180
for everything that he has done for the PSF over the years. Thank you Kurt.

85
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:09,180
Thank you all for joining me on stage. Thank you.

86
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:29,000
Now let us give some recognition to community members. Community service awards are given

87
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,600
out quarterly usually to two Python uses at a time. These awards are a way for the

88
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,960
PSF to offer recognition for tremendous time and effort contributed by those that help

89
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:46,960
strengthen and improve Python's ecosystem. Let us welcome Mario Corsero to the stage.

90
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:53,960
Mario was awarded a community service award in 2018 for his leadership and organization

91
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:08,880
of PyCon ES, PyLandinium and the PyCon Charlestrack here at PyCon. His work has been instrumental

92
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,880
in promoting the use of Python and fostering Python communities in Spain, Latin America

93
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,680
and the UK. Thank you Mario.

94
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,880
Next we have Chuck Woody Nookchukwu. Chuck's unfortunately could not make it to PyCon this

95
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,640
year but Chuck's received this community service award in 2019 for his contribution to spreading

96
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:03,640
the growth of Python to the Nigerian community and his dedication and research to the PSF

97
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,880
community. Next I would like to welcome Alex Gainer to the stage. Alex received his CSA

98
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:32,720
in 2018 for his contributions to the Python and Django communities and the Python Software

99
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Foundation. Alex previously served as a PSF director in 2015 through 2016. He serves as

100
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,680
an infrastructure staff member and contributes to legacy PyPI and the next generation warehouse

101
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:52,000
and has helped legacy warehouse insecurity and cutting down bandwidth costs by compressing

102
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
404 images. Thank you Alex.

103
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Now let's welcome Marietta Vigia to the stage. The 2018 third quarter award was given to

104
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:31,240
Marietta for her contributions to CPython, her efforts to improve the workflow of Python

105
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:37,680
Core team and her work in increasing diversity in our community. In addition to that her

106
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,680
work as co-chair of PyCascades and co-organizer of the mentor spritz here at PyCon helps spread

107
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:51,760
the growth and diversity of Python. Thank you Marietta.

108
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Now let's welcome Mayella Sanchez-Miranda to the stage.

109
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:25,320
The 2018 fourth quarter award was given to Mayella for her work as the PyCon charlis 2019

110
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:33,320
chair and founding member of PyCon charlis as well as being the organizer of Python Day

111
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Mexico and Django Girls Puebla. Thank you Mayella.

112
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:47,320
Up next we welcome John Roa. The second 2018 Q4 award went to John Roa for his work as

113
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:54,320
founder and conference chair of PyCon Columbia. Additionally John Roa has been instrumental

114
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:01,320
with Python Outreach in Columbia especially via Django Girls workshops. Thank you John.

115
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:10,320
The second 2018 Q4 award went to John Roa for his work as founder and conference chair of

116
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,320
PyCon Columbia. Thank you John.

117
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:34,880
The 2019 Q1 award went to Stefan Bechnell for his work as main developer and maintainer

118
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:42,200
of two important Python projects, Scython and LXML. Unfortunately Stefan could not join

119
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:49,600
us this year but let us give him a round of applause.

120
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Now let us welcome Eric Ma to the stage.

121
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,880
The 2019 Q1 community service award was given to Eric because he has continually gone above

122
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:22,160
and beyond his responsibilities as PyCon's financial aid co-chair and chair this year.

123
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,680
Additionally Eric has been a dedicated PyCon program member for several years. For those

124
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,960
of you that receive speaker grants or financial aid be sure to thank Eric for his dedication

125
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:40,960
when you see him around. Thank you Eric.

126
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:54,200
That wraps up our awards this year. There are so many awesome contributors in our community

127
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,580
and this is a great way to recognize their work. If you would like to nominate someone

128
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:05,580
for a future community service award please send your nomination to us. It is PSF at Python.org.

129
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:13,340
Thank you everyone.

130
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:23,260
Thank you Eva and thanks to all of you for your work. Can we get one more round of applause

131
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:30,260
for the award winners? Thank you. Eva spoke a lot about the PSF staff but didn't say much

132
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:37,300
about herself. The dedication and work that Eva puts in consistently to make sure that

133
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:44,300
the Python Software Foundation and PyCon happen is immeasurable. If we get one round of applause

134
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:51,300
then Eva will be the first to say a few words. Thank you.

135
00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:00,260
Applause just for Eva.
