1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,720
Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,720
My name is Enric.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,360
I'm a production engineer up in Facebook Seattle.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,080
Those of you who aren't aware, Facebook is a platinum sponsor of the PyCon, yeah, the

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,080
PSF.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,360
And we're always very grateful to be here at PyCon.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,040
This is actually my second PyCon.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,040
My first PyCon was in 2010, so I'm hoping to do at least another one in the next decade.

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,400
For those of you who aren't aware, Facebook actually does use Python quite a bit, not

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,080
just the PHP shop.

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,440
From the more obvious, like, data analysts and things like that, to the less obvious,

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,180
like, our entire configuration management system.

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,640
We also use it quite a bit in a little product that we have heard of called Instagram.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,960
Now, personally, I wasn't a big Instagram user until I got a puppy.

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,240
And all of a sudden, everybody wanted to know his IG handle, and I had to get one.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,480
So IG uses quite a few open source technologies, such as Celery and Django, to help deliver

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,520
those cute puppy photos to your inbox every day.

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,000
Now, we're also proud to be a sponsor of several open source projects, like PyTorch, which

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,520
is a drop-in replacement for NumPy, and actually lets you use a lot of those juicy GPUs to

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,400
get more performance out of your software.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,500
We also provide Pyre, which is a performance type checking system, which really speeds

22
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,860
up your testing.

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,500
And finally, this is actually my favorite I just found out about this one.

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,300
It's called Monkey Type.

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,540
Actually allows you to profile your code, and it will actually provide stubs or directly

26
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,740
annotate your code to automatically add type hints, which honestly blew my mind.

27
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,060
Now, I'm extremely proud to be at Facebook.

28
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,220
We are very grateful to be here.

29
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:54,100
We're very thankful for all of your contributions to the Python community, and, of course,

30
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,100
to the rest of the world.

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:03,580
Without any further ado, I want to give a brief thanks to the Python organizers, to

32
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:09,340
PSF, and thank you for all of you guys for making this the best PyCon to come.

33
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,260
I'm looking forward to seeing everybody next year at Pittsburgh.

34
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,300
Thank you.

35
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,100
Thank you.

36
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,300
Oh, excuse me.

37
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,300
Sorry.

38
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,140
As out running this morning, so a round of applause for everyone who took part in the

39
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,140
5K.

40
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,020
I was a little worried people would get lost in the fog, but we made it.

41
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:45,460
A quick reminder, this is our contact information and more information that you can find for

42
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,180
our code of conduct.

43
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,100
And if you need to report, you can use that contact information or find someone wearing

44
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,420
one of these shirts.

45
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,380
And once again, there it is.

46
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,660
Reminder mother's rooms are in room 17 and 18.

47
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,660
Those are continuing to open today.

48
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,100
You can find instructions for access at the front of that door.

49
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,940
Quiet room is room 24 if you need to get away.

50
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:15,860
A reminder that the expo hall has been completely reconfigured into the posters and job fair.

51
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,180
That's going to begin immediately after this session and run until 1 p.m.

52
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,860
Lunch will also be served in there around lunchtime.

53
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,980
I don't remember exactly when.

54
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,500
Talks.

55
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,580
Talks continue today.

56
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,260
There are three talk sessions this afternoon after the poster and job fair.

57
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,620
The open spaces are still open until 11 p.m. tonight.

58
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,580
You can still go to PyCon.us to find out what's on the board right now and head over to the

59
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,460
board to add if there's any slots that remain.

60
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,340
The final plenary session, which will have the PSF community update and awards, final

61
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,500
keynote and closing remarks will be at...

62
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,100
I don't have my speaker notes.

63
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,980
Anybody know what time the final thing starts?

64
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,340
3 10.

65
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,140
And that will be in this room.

66
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,140
Sprints.

67
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,140
Oh.

68
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,700
Whoa.

69
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
It's all working.

70
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,260
So sprints continue after today, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

71
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,700
If you're interested in sprinting and you'll be in town, make sure to allocate some time

72
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,840
to stick around after the closing session.

73
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,020
So that will be around 4.30 on.

74
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,660
The little sprint rows will occur.

75
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,700
This is when everyone who's...

76
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,700
What's that?

77
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,700
Oh.

78
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,560
I was like, Kushal, am I lying?

79
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,520
So Kushal will be leading sprint rows, which is where if you are planning to sprint on

80
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,460
a project, you can come on up here and announce to everyone who's interested what you're working

81
00:04:52,460 --> 00:05:02,340
on and how to get in contact.

82
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,640
There we go.

83
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,240
So a quick reminder, the PSF is running a fundraiser concurrently with PyCon.

84
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,780
You can find more information on that fundraiser and how to contribute at PyCon.us.

85
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,900
Speaking of the...

86
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,900
Here we go.

87
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,380
So right now I'm really excited to welcome to the stage the inaugural Python steering

88
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,380
council.

89
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,700
So this is the group that is responsible for governance of the Python language and C Python

90
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,700
interpreter.

91
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,080
The panel is going to be moderated by Eva, the executive director of the PSF, and we're

92
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,840
going to do introductions of the panel members shortly.

93
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:57,580
So go ahead and welcome them to the stage.

94
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,780
Good morning, PyCon.

95
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,300
Thanks so much for joining us.

96
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,660
So welcome to our panel with Python steering council.

97
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,660
My name is Eva.

98
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,920
I'm the executive director of the Python Software Foundation, which is the nonprofit behind

99
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Python.

100
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,960
I'll be the moderator for this session.

101
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:24,080
Python's governance recently shifted from the BDFL model to a steering council.

102
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,560
If you're interested in reading about this change and how it was achieved, you can check

103
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,880
out these links above.

104
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,240
We are here to learn more about the steering council members, what the steering council

105
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,140
does, and learn about their mandates.

106
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,740
At the end of the panel, we'll open the floor to audience questions, so please start thinking

107
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,460
about what you'd like to ask now.

108
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,140
So on stage with me, we have the five steering council members.

109
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:55,660
We have Barry Warsaw, Brett Cannon, Carol Willing, Guido Van Rossum, and Nick Coughlin.

110
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,000
Before we get into what the steering council does, let's get to know you all a bit.

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,900
You can tell us things like why you became a core developer, or in Guido's case, why

112
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,640
you even created Python, what types of Python development interests you, projects you've

113
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,720
used Python for, and so on.

114
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,160
Barry, let's start with you.

115
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
Okay.

116
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,320
Well, thanks.

117
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:23,080
So I work at LinkedIn, and I'm on the Python Foundation team.

118
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,000
Many of my teammates are here, which is awesome.

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We do a lot of Python.

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,020
We basically support Python at LinkedIn.

121
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,520
You know, I think I've told my story many times.

122
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,420
This is Guido Van Rossum's Python World Tour.

123
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:45,720
It happened in 1994 in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and that's when I met Guido, fell in love

124
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,080
with Python and Guido, of course.

125
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,480
And I think, you know, just like not going away is part of the trick, right, sticking

126
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,560
around long enough.

127
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,780
There were 20 people at the first Python workshop, which is pretty amazing to look out at this

128
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,220
crowd.

129
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,500
I think all of us knew Python was really special when we first were introduced to it, and we

130
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,180
certainly knew Guido was very special.

131
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:20,020
But to see where both the language and the community has gone in 25 years, none of us

132
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,580
could have expected it, and I think it's kind of miraculous, actually, because it's not

133
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,840
only changed the tech landscape, but it's changed all of our lives.

134
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:38,200
I know certainly for myself, I wouldn't have the life I have without Python, so I'm amazingly

135
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
grateful for that.

136
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
That's a great story.

137
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Many of us are in the same boat.

138
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Yeah.

139
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Brett, how about you?

140
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:50,680
Yeah, so I'm a dev manager for the Python extension for VS Code at Microsoft, where

141
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,180
I get to do that most of the time, but any spare time I get, work lets me actually just

142
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,400
spend on Python itself.

143
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,780
In terms of how I got started, it's a slightly long story, but the gist of it is I got the

144
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,060
recipe in the Python cookbook.

145
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,060
It was not perfect.

146
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,540
It drove me nuts for about a year.

147
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,780
I figured out how to make it perfect.

148
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,540
At least in my mind.

149
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,820
And then Alex Martelli, the editor, I asked how do I get this into Python because I think

150
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,460
other people might find it useful.

151
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,820
I said, oh, email this mailing list called Python dev.

152
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,120
So I did in June of 2002, I believe it was Skip Monero, actually, who responded and told

153
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,240
me how to do it and go through the workflow.

154
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
I did it.

155
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
It got accepted.

156
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,040
I was doing a gap year between my undergrad and my graduate program start, so I figured,

157
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
oh, this is fun.

158
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
I'll keep doing this.

159
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,080
And lo and behold, I kept doing it enough that eventually I asked I'd do a PR for something

160
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,880
and then I just said I need someone to merge it and Guido said, well, we'll get someone

161
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,980
to give you a commit where you merge it yourself.

162
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,700
I think I was just bothering everyone a little too much.

163
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,500
And just been involved ever since.

164
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:00,060
Basically I'm somewhat known for a phrase where I said it came from the language but

165
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,100
I said it for the community and part of that is the people up on this stage and the people

166
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,420
I've gotten to work with and know over the years from the dev team.

167
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,420
I basically learned how to program, honestly, from these people and have just become great

168
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,500
friends and that's why I keep coming back year after year.

169
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,720
Yeah, the community is a great aspect.

170
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,960
Carol, how about you?

171
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
I'm Carol Willing.

172
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,600
Thank you all for being here.

173
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,760
Back in 2016 I did a keynote in the Philippines and I talked about how Python was the people's

174
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:37,800
programming language and when I started back in 2012 using Python, as a person, I thought

175
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,760
this is really fun to program in.

176
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:46,420
And then I also got involved with Jupyter Notebooks and thought this is great stuff.

177
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:52,500
We can spread learning about Python, learning about different disciplines, whether it's

178
00:10:52,500 --> 00:11:00,060
science, data science, embedded computing, web stuff, and I saw the power of it then.

179
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:06,100
And I wanted to be a part of it and so I started more on the community side with the Python

180
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:11,920
Software Foundation and working with Open Hatch, which was a non-profit that helped

181
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,160
people make their first contribution to open source and through that I started learning

182
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:26,720
the core Python workflow and what I really wanted was to, from a technical standpoint,

183
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:34,440
learn how to be a core developer but even more so to develop processes and an environment

184
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:42,500
where the core team reflects how we use Python in the real world and who we serve because

185
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,660
I think Python is used to really touch so many people's lives and it will be for the

186
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,120
next 20 or so years.

187
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,660
So it's up to all of us to make it better year by year.

188
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,660
Absolutely.

189
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,200
So thank you.

190
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Guido?

191
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,000
Oh, that was so wonderful to hear.

192
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,180
I don't even know what the question is because the sound here is terrible on stage.

193
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,040
Tell us something fun about yourself.

194
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,260
About myself, well, I was a programmer.

195
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:20,620
I was on an environment where there wasn't a language that I liked so I made one out

196
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,140
of pieces that I had learned previously.

197
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:32,480
And because I can't write code and not have other people use it, I made it open source

198
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,540
and the rest was really the community.

199
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,460
APPLAUSE

200
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:53,680
So fast forward to last year when I was at the top of responsibilities, controversial

201
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,820
pups left and right, and I had a case of burnout where I thought I've done this almost 30 years

202
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:08,160
being the BDFL of this language, it's time for someone else or some other structure.

203
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,680
And so I announced that one day.

204
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:18,080
Literally the night before I had approved a very controversial PEP.

205
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,360
You may be familiar with the Walrus operator.

206
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,360
The next morning I woke up and I thought I don't want to be BDFL any more.

207
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:34,860
I spent 20 minutes drafting a nice email to the core developers asking them to go take

208
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,700
care of themselves.

209
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,020
It was really like what are you going to do?

210
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,020
Set up some government.

211
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:51,180
Do it however you think is the right way to do.

212
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,140
And it was such a relief.

213
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,140
But I don't know.

214
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,140
You know how this goes.

215
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,200
When your kid goes off to college, some of you may have experience with that.

216
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,040
I will soon have that experience.

217
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:12,080
You're no longer directly involved in their lives, maybe, but you never stop worrying.

218
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,360
And that's how I feel about Python at the moment.

219
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
And that's why I...

220
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,360
APPLAUSE

221
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:26,860
Why I nominated myself for the steering committee and here I am.

222
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,860
LAUGHTER

223
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,500
Nick, tell us something about yourself.

224
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:40,980
So for me, I actually came to Python as a hardware and CC++ guy because I needed to

225
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,900
test some signal processing code.

226
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,820
And Python had the unit test module.

227
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:53,380
It had the wave module and it had this thing called Swig to let me wrap our C++ drivers.

228
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:59,660
And so I did that for hardware control for comm systems.

229
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:05,020
And now I do it for electric vehicle fast charges with Tritium.

230
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:10,780
And it's just this language that lets me reach out and touch the real world without having

231
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,380
to worry about all the messy details.

232
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,340
And then I got involved in Core Dev.

233
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:24,260
This was this community of people on the internet that talked about this language and how we

234
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:31,100
make computers, how we bridge from that to the way people actually think and just make

235
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:37,780
that more accessible and make it, yeah, talk to the computer the way you think and have

236
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:44,380
it do what you meant is kind of amazing and a lot of fun.

237
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,660
We're all very grateful to have your experiences and backgrounds part of our community.

238
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,700
Guido, now that you've experienced being both BDFL of Python as well as the Steering Council

239
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:59,820
member, tell us how do you think governance has changed and will continue to change?

240
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
I'm sorry.

241
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,180
I did not hear the full question.

242
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:09,420
Now that you've experienced being BDFL and also part of the Steering Council committee,

243
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:14,300
how do you think that the governance has changed and will continue to change of Python?

244
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,460
Okay, yeah.

245
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:24,900
So while I was BDFL, sort of the way it felt to me and I think the way it felt to most

246
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:33,060
other people as well was whenever there was some controversial decision, it would eventually

247
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:41,860
bubble up to me, which meant that I was always scanning Python dev and Python ideas for things

248
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:49,540
that might become controversial and trying to nip it in the bud if I could and every

249
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:58,100
PEP basically eventually became my responsibility after the people with the greater domain knowledge

250
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:07,060
and expertise had sorted it out to the point where they had a yes, no question or an A,

251
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,620
B choice.

252
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,360
And that's pretty stressful.

253
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:25,420
And so I'm very glad that sort of that responsibility is now divided, distributed over five experts

254
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,820
who have more of the trust of the community because they've actually been voted in rather

255
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:40,340
than just become the leader or leaders by happenstance.

256
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:47,580
So the voting has sort of voting for the Steering Council, I think, creates a real different

257
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:53,060
relationship between the Steering Council and the core dev community than whatever existed

258
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:57,660
between the core devs and myself as BDFL.

259
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:06,820
Going forward, I think that we're also structuring the decision-making process somewhat differently.

260
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:15,740
The Steering Council is not actually the group of people who decide about most PEPs anymore.

261
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:23,860
What's written in our constitution, PEP 13, and what we sort of use as guidelines is that

262
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:30,420
for most decisions we actually pick an expert from among the core devs and sometimes external

263
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:38,340
contributors that we know well, and we settle them with the question and the decision.

264
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:44,520
And so far, we've only got a few months' experience with that process.

265
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,800
So far, I think that is going great.

266
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:54,160
And so going forward, the Steering Council is going to delegate whatever it can with

267
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:02,320
the understanding that the delegate who decides eventually gets to report to the Steering

268
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,320
Council.

269
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:10,480
If a delegate suddenly turns around 180 degrees and does wild things that the Steering Council

270
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,160
think that's too much or maybe that's too little, we can recall them, but I expect that

271
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:23,640
to be a very rare occurrence because we pick our people based on many years of experience

272
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:30,440
with their behavior and their expertise and so a real connection and trust.

273
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,280
I think that's what I have to say about the governance.

274
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,920
Yeah, maybe in three years we'll get on stage again and do this over, see how it's changed

275
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,560
since now.

276
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,800
Python and data science continues to grow in popularity.

277
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,600
Carol, you're also a Project Jupiter Steering Council member.

278
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,080
As the one with the strongest tie to scientific Python community, can you tell us why it's

279
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,880
important for the scientific community to have representation on the Steering Council?

280
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,360
Sure.

281
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:08,000
I think it's important in general for the Steering Council to be willing to listen to

282
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,640
new ideas from all areas of the community.

283
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:20,640
The needs that we have in web and embedded education, science, data science, are going

284
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,520
to be slightly different depending on certain things.

285
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:31,560
These things will be very similar, but there will be specifics that impact maybe the science

286
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,120
world or the education world more than others.

287
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:42,520
I think by having a variety of experiences and backgrounds on the Steering Council, whether

288
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:50,040
it's specifically science or just what you've done technically, is important because I think

289
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:56,640
the diversity is what gives us better decisions, better understanding of what's happening out

290
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,960
in the community and really trying to address where we need to make improvements and where

291
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:10,700
we want to go forward and actually blaze new trails.

292
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,720
I think the science community and the data science community brings us a lot of technical

293
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:23,720
expertise and in many cases also research opportunities as well, so maybe potentially

294
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,480
some funding down the road.

295
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,000
So I think it's a good thing.

296
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Absolutely.

297
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,200
Brett, you've managed a lot of core Dev infrastructure work, so I'll ask you about PEP 581.

298
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:44,760
PEP 581 authored by Marietta, outlines the steps needed to migrate Python's issue tracker

299
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,040
from Roundup to GitHub.

300
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,920
Looking at the schedule, even PEP 581 was discussed at the language summit on Thursday.

301
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:57,160
Can you tell us all a little bit about what was discussed and what the next steps are?

302
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,280
Sure.

303
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:06,760
So PEP 581, as before, what, a week ago, two weeks ago, outlined the rationale of the idea

304
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:14,240
of moving our issue tracker from bugstoppython.org over to GitHub under our repo there.

305
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,040
As of a week ago, I believe Barry took an initial stab at splitting up between keeping

306
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:26,200
581 as the rationale and PEP 588 as the actual steps that would be taken to actually do the

307
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
migration.

308
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,720
Basically, the status of all that is when we first formed the council, we went through

309
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,800
all the open PEPs, PEP 581 by Marietta in the front row was there, so we discussed it.

310
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,840
We all agreed that we are amenable to it.

311
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,520
No official decision has been made, though, and we realized that PEP needed to be split

312
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
up.

313
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,920
At the language summit, Marietta presented on it.

314
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,040
We took some feedback from the room about what people thought and such, what we thought

315
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,920
might need to happen.

316
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,040
We started to have initial discussions with Eva on the PSF about potentially trying to

317
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,880
have a PM sort of role to help handle the migration because we realized that if we go

318
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,160
forward with this, the migration of those issues is going to be critical and we don't

319
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:16,400
want any problems because Lord knows I've had my own handful of those over the years

320
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,280
moving our infrastructure around.

321
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:25,000
So basically at this point, it sits at we all think it's a good idea, no official decision

322
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,760
has been made, and we are talking to you about how to make sure we can get that staffed and

323
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,640
handled appropriately if and when we decide to go forward with it.

324
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,640
Absolutely.

325
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,640
We'll keep that process going.

326
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,520
Nick, you're also a member of the PSF's grants work group.

327
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,800
I'm sorry, packaging work group.

328
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,920
Last year the work group rolled out the warehouse code base thanks to the Mozilla grant that

329
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,580
the PSF received which made several improvements.

330
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,820
In March of this year, the work group launched work for the next set of improvements which

331
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,840
will be around security and accessibility.

332
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,920
What do you now as a steering council member think should be the next steps or features

333
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,000
or improvements that the packaging work group should take?

334
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,960
One of the points I would like to make is the two roles I suspect are surprisingly separate

335
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,960
for a lot of people.

336
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,920
There's the Python packaging authority which uses the packaging working group to essentially

337
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:27,800
coordinate with the PSF and then Python core development and the steering council in a

338
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:33,000
similar role again working with the PSF around resource management and that kind of thing.

339
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,640
So I think on the steering council side we have some work to do clarifying those relationships

340
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,580
and making them clear to the wider community, not just the folks involved.

341
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:49,440
But on the actual Python packaging index side, the authentication stuff that's currently

342
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,280
in progress with the open tech fund, after that there's a lot that could be done around

343
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,880
improving the publisher experience.

344
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,400
We've put a lot in recent years in terms of improving the consumer experience.

345
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,080
But on the publisher side, releases are getting a lot more complicated.

346
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,240
So people are wanting to upload source distributions plus multiple wheels for different platforms

347
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,640
and different Python versions.

348
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,760
And at the moment, the packaging index is kind of this instant published thing.

349
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,360
Like you push it up, it's done.

350
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,880
It's like you committed, that's it.

351
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,880
No changes.

352
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,320
It's out there.

353
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,440
And we'd really like to be able to offer a staging area where people can put up all the

354
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,400
artifacts for release, make sure everything's in order, make sure everything's there.

355
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,280
And then once they're happy with the release, push a button and have it go publish.

356
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,280
So yeah, so there's some ideas around how to do that.

357
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,600
But yeah, I think that's one of the next big areas of improvement coming down the pipeline.

358
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,540
Yeah, continuing improvements is going to be something we need to concentrate on.

359
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,120
And I know that the packaging summit is happening the first day of sprints as well, so I'm sure

360
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,360
other ideas will come out of that.

361
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,720
Barry, as one of the authors of PEP 1 and the entire PEP process as it is, can you tell

362
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,160
us a bit how the PEP process has changed with the new governance model?

363
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,240
Sure.

364
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:15,160
So you know, PEPs, the idea of PEPs kind of came out of Guido and my time at CNRI because

365
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:22,880
CNRI ran the IETF, so we were sort of familiar with RFCs and Internet standards.

366
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,920
I thought that would be a good format, although I wanted something much more lightweight that

367
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,880
would just be enough process for us to get our work done without being too much process.

368
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,360
I don't know how successful that has been.

369
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,240
And the purpose of the PEP was so that Guido didn't have to go through thousands of emails

370
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:49,520
and try to figure out what the actual proposal was so that he could just read one document

371
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,920
and get an idea of both the pros and the cons for a particular proposal and then make a

372
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,720
decision and then we would record that entire process, the decision-making process within

373
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,160
the PEPs.

374
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:08,080
You know, as Guido alluded to, all those decisions kind of funneled through him and I think that

375
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,760
that became untenable for many reasons, partly I think because there's aspects of this amazing

376
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:23,080
ecosystem that other people are maybe better equipped to decide or Guido just isn't really

377
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,200
involved in that.

378
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,280
So then we came up with the idea of the delegates, the BDFL delegates, who Guido could say that's

379
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:37,960
an expert, we're going to let that person make the decision on this particular feature.

380
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,400
We talked about this a little bit earlier in the steering council.

381
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,640
BDFL delegate was sort of a last resort.

382
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:51,320
It was for the things that Guido wanted not to be involved in and I think with the new

383
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,280
governance model, it's really sort of the first resort.

384
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,960
We don't want to make those decisions.

385
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,680
If there are people in the community who are better equipped to do that, that's what we

386
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
want to do.

387
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:11,120
We want to allow other people to become engaged with shaping where Python is going to go in

388
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,360
the next 25 years.

389
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,120
I think that's really important because none of us are getting younger, certainly.

390
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,640
I'll speak for myself.

391
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,680
The Python community is so much bigger now, right?

392
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:30,760
So this gives the next generation of Python leaders an opportunity to step up, become

393
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,720
involved, make important decisions that will shape the language and eventually move into

394
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,920
those leadership roles.

395
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:44,040
I think that's the way we keep the community healthy and keep the language healthy and

396
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,920
vibrant for the next 25 years.

397
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,360
I'm really excited about it.

398
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,440
I'm really glad that we've sort of moved to much more delegation.

399
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,320
There are a few PEPs where we're kind of keeping for ourselves because we might think that

400
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:04,040
they're sort of more appropriate for the elected steering council to decide, but we work with

401
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,840
the delegates and we work with the PEP authors to come up with the right solution there.

402
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,560
Sounds like a great change.

403
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:16,560
So now asking the entire group, do you all consider implementations of Python part of

404
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:23,200
the scope of the steering council preview or do you just focus on the language itself?

405
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,080
I'll take that one.

406
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:34,120
We totally see implementations of Python as something that we care about and that we should

407
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:45,120
care about and where we are discussing our thoughts about how should we move the language

408
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:51,680
and the implementation or implementations forward.

409
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,640
Just to ask the audience, how many people still use Python 2 in the room?

410
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,640
Whoa.

411
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Not as many hands as I thought.

412
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
I know.

413
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,000
That's actually the nice one.

414
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,520
So Python 2 will not be maintained past 2019.

415
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,560
The sunset is around the corner, only about eight months away.

416
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,840
So what's the game plan for Python 2's retirement?

417
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,840
A party.

418
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,840
Yeah.

419
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,840
Yeah.

420
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:34,360
I know that we spoke about the possibility of hiring a PM and that person is going to

421
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,600
probably be tasked with communication and directing people to the right place, but can

422
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,400
you give us a little bit more information on things like that?

423
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
Yeah.

424
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,360
I mean, obviously the plans are moving forward.

425
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,360
They're not going to change.

426
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,360
Thank goodness.

427
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:53,120
And as you've alluded to, we are starting to talk about potentially having a PM come

428
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,320
forward to help us sunset and just figure out all the little minute details because

429
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,760
obviously, for instance, search for something in the standard library.

430
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:11,560
Right now search engines often go to docs.python.org slash 2, which is not the version you're all

431
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,560
going to care about starting in 2020.

432
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,080
There's other things on the website in the documentation where it says 2 and 3 because

433
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,680
starting in 2020, there's just Python because we won't really have to care about the major

434
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,840
number as much anymore.

435
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,880
So just little details like that I think still need to get worked out, but otherwise this

436
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:36,920
trend is very much moving forward and it's going to hit that date whether basically period.

437
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:43,400
One resource I'd point people towards is a talk Chris Neugebauer gave at PyCon Australia

438
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,640
a couple of years ago called Python 3 for people who haven't been paying attention.

439
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,680
And it's just really good talk going through some of the options.

440
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:57,340
We do expect there will be commercial vendors offering support beyond 2020 for the people

441
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,520
who have business critical systems that haven't been migrated yet and they're just going,

442
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,800
look, we just really, really need a bit more time.

443
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,480
There will be options there.

444
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,080
But yeah, the 2020 deadline is we're not doing this for free anymore.

445
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,160
So I got a couple comments.

446
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:20,000
I tend to be the pragmatist and if I look back two to three years, we were in a very

447
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,680
different space regarding Python 2 and Python 3 support.

448
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:31,800
We've come a long way in terms of the major packages that support Python 3.

449
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:37,040
Brett had a wonderful graphic ticker and I think we've got all the top, what was it,

450
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,120
300 and something.

451
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:46,160
I think from the science standpoint, we've been using 3 for a long time.

452
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:52,200
And I recognise that there's a lot of legacy code out there that's using Python 2.

453
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:58,600
And if I look back a couple years, like Instagram did a great keynote about how they were moving

454
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,640
things from 2 to 3.

455
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:08,240
I think one of the things that we want like a PM to help us in this transition is to really

456
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,200
take those best practices that we're learning from large companies who have found the business

457
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,560
case to transition to make it easier.

458
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,320
And we recognise there's going to be bumps along the way.

459
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,640
But I think as a community and over time, we'll get there.

460
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:33,440
And I think we'll get there more by pulling together than to try and polarise apart.

461
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:40,160
Finding the bright spots in a situation like this are always a good example to go by.

462
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,480
So we're kind of running out of time.

463
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,520
So I'm going to pick one more question for the group and then after that we're going

464
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,120
to start taking questions from the audience.

465
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,380
What does the steering council have planned for growing and sustaining diversity within

466
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,380
core development?

467
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,840
I'm sorry, I didn't hear the...

468
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,840
Growing diversity.

469
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
Growing diversity.

470
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:05,920
Well, I think we just need to first celebrate the progress that we have made.

471
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,280
2017, it wasn't that long ago.

472
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,360
Marietta was the first core dev as a woman.

473
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,760
And we have a long way to go still with diversity.

474
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:25,200
But I think what we're trying to focus in on is leveraging the interests that people

475
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:34,400
have to be inclusive, to create processes and tooling that allows more people to be

476
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:43,480
able to contribute and to have the learning curve towards contribution to become less.

477
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:49,540
And also to really strengthen the third party library ecosystem as well.

478
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:55,160
Because a lot of folks get their start in third party packages, which is fantastic.

479
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,560
For those of you who are at the sprints, I hope you have a great time.

480
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,920
If you've never been to a sprint, you're a little tentative, please come.

481
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,680
And thank you to the folks that attended and organized the mentored sprints yesterday.

482
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,400
That's an excellent step in the right direction.

483
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,880
Yeah, absolutely.

484
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,680
So...

485
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,540
So I mentioned this when Paul Everett and I had our little interview.

486
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,620
I look out here and I see this crowd.

487
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,740
Every one of you can become a core dev.

488
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,740
Every single person.

489
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,020
You don't have to be a C programmer.

490
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:37,900
All you have to do is care about Python and want to learn how to become a core dev.

491
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:43,020
And I know many of us on stage and there are many people in the community who are mentoring

492
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,420
people.

493
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:49,080
And so think about diversity in all the axes of diversity.

494
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,760
Like what your experience is.

495
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,320
You don't have to be a professional programmer, right?

496
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,040
You can be young, old, doesn't matter.

497
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,660
So widen your horizons.

498
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,480
Think about yourself as a core dev.

499
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,340
And then if that's something that you really want to aspire to, engage with mentors and

500
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,760
learn the process of contributing to Python.

501
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,640
Because we need everybody.

502
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,400
There's so much work to do and so many interesting things to do that I think everybody can really

503
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
contribute to Python.

504
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,860
There's no reason why you can't.

505
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,860
That's such great advice.

506
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,140
Thanks for adding that, Barry.

507
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,380
So next up I'm going to post this link where everyone can go and add their questions for

508
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,460
the steering council.

509
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:36,220
So it's PyCon.us slash panel.

510
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:41,020
And Ernest, somewhere in the back, is going to pop some questions up as soon as they come

511
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,020
in.

512
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:48,020
It's like I need the Jeopardy music playing right now.

513
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,020
Do do do do do do do.

514
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,020
Mine did Ian Pickens live.

515
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,020
Kudos to the AV folks.

516
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,020
We're done here.

517
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,020
All right, Anonymous.

518
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,020
What is your favorite PEP?

519
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,020
That's easy.

520
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,020
PEP 401.

521
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,020
PEP 401.

522
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,020
3100.

523
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,020
Carol.

524
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,020
Probably 581.

525
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,020
All right.

526
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,020
Guido.

527
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,020
484.

528
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,020
384.

529
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,020
343.

530
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,020
343.

531
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,020
All right.

532
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:46,020
The next question is, what are the first steps to take to become a core dev with Python?

533
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,020
Look at the dev guide.

534
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,020
Yeah.

535
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:53,020
Devguide.python.org is a good place to start to get an idea of our process, how things

536
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,020
work.

537
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:59,020
Just kind of see the lay of the land and just see if it's something that interests you.

538
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,020
Yeah.

539
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,020
Can you give us that URL again?

540
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
Devguide.python.org.

541
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,020
Thanks.

542
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:14,020
The next one is, what do you see as the biggest gap in the language right now?

543
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:22,020
I actually don't know that there are big gaps in the language, but I think that the CPython

544
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,020
interpreter needs...

545
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:31,020
I guess the way I sort of talk about it with people is that the language is pretty awesome,

546
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,020
right?

547
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,020
That's what we love about it.

548
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:40,020
And Python is kind of unique in the sense that it's great for one-off scripts, and it

549
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:46,820
grows as you start to get more ambitious and as your team grows, and then you can run Instagram

550
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,820
on Python, right?

551
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,020
Like, that's a big code base.

552
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:56,020
And Python, and especially with the typing, type annotations, it can grow to large teams,

553
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,020
small teams, and so on.

554
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:04,020
You know, the interpreter, in a sense, is 28 years old.

555
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:10,740
And, you know, the state of the art of virtual machines has come a long way in that time.

556
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:18,460
And I think that what I'm particularly interested in is how can we make Python faster?

557
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,860
You know, how can we take it into more environments where it's not in right now?

558
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,580
Those are the things that I think we need to spend some focus on.

559
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,060
The language is pretty good.

560
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,140
There's not a lot missing that I, you know, not a lot of things that I'm missing from

561
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,140
it.

562
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,700
So that's my take.

563
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,460
I'm similar to Barry.

564
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,420
The language itself, I don't think it's missing a lot.

565
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:45,660
The thing I'm most jealous of from another ecosystem is JavaScript source maps.

566
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:50,700
Because the way our trace specs currently work, there's a vast difference between what

567
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:56,100
you get with a pure Python module versus as soon as you do any kind of transformational

568
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,820
compilation on that module, you basically break your own trace backs.

569
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:04,580
And there's a lot of stuff around source maps in the JavaScript world where they can do

570
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:09,020
lots of transformations in their pipelines, but their debuggers and their trace back generators

571
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:14,540
can still figure out what was that originally before it got transformed and tell you, like,

572
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:20,700
in the original source code where you need to go look to find the source of a fault.

573
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,740
And in theory, we could adapt that to Python.

574
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,620
There's nothing intrinsically JavaScript specific about it.

575
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,780
But yeah, it just requires folks to sit down and do the design work.

576
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,780
All right.

577
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:36,700
I think we have time for one more question before we wrap this up.

578
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,460
Anonymous posted, we hear a lot about burnout of core developers.

579
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:46,100
What does the council have, does the council have any plans to improve this?

580
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,020
Is there anything that the community can do also?

581
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,140
I think you're going to start hitting me.

582
00:40:52,140 --> 00:41:00,820
So yeah, so in terms of specific plans, I think in general, it's to just make being

583
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:05,900
a core dev easier in terms of time and effort required.

584
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:12,260
Hence some excitement up here, obviously, for pet 581 and such, and just various ways

585
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,100
we can just make it easier for core devs to get their work done.

586
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:20,980
In terms of what the community can do, honestly, just be nice to core devs.

587
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,620
We are on social media.

588
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,540
You can watch my keynote from last year about this.

589
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,540
But basically, we are all on social media.

590
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,300
So when people go online and start griping about a decision we made, we do see that.

591
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,300
We do read it.

592
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,740
We do feel it because we do care a lot.

593
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,580
And so constructive feedback is always welcome.

594
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,300
But just flat out negative feedback really doesn't help anyone.

595
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,940
And it just adds to the negativity and just the burnout rate.

596
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:50,580
So honestly, just be nice online.

597
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,580
And that would help immensely.

598
00:41:53,580 --> 00:42:01,380
And Carol, you have something to add.

599
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,580
Yeah, I had a few more things.

600
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:09,440
Going back to where I said Python's the people's programming language, we are all people.

601
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,020
We have feelings.

602
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,580
We make mistakes.

603
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,620
We do good things.

604
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,580
We try and celebrate people's efforts.

605
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,180
Sometimes we get it wrong.

606
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,460
Tell us kindly.

607
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:26,820
And I think one of the things that really pleasantly surprised me and I'm very proud

608
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:35,220
of is from Guido stepping down as BDFL to where we are now with the steering council,

609
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:43,940
The core team and the greater community did a fantastic job of pulling together, working

610
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:48,380
to the common goal of we value the language.

611
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,340
We want it to persist.

612
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:56,660
So we're going to be decent through this process of trying to come up with different options

613
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:03,420
for the language to ultimately selecting a steering council.

614
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:11,020
And I think a lot of what Brett says is what you write, remember, there's a person on the

615
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,260
other side.

616
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:16,140
What you say, there's a person on the other side.

617
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,060
If you get it wrong, apologize.

618
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:28,940
I'm sorry goes a long way in at least making environments kinder, safer to work in, and

619
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,860
ultimately a lot more fun and productive.

620
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,940
So thank you to the core team.

621
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,580
Thank you to everybody that contributes to Python and uses Python.

622
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,580
And thank you all.

623
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,580
Yeah.

624
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:48,500
Nick, you want to add something?

625
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,500
And I'll just add one last one for this one, which is we are actively working with the

626
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:57,900
Python software foundation to look for ways the foundation can better support.

627
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:02,580
So one concrete way to help is a better resource to Python software foundation can do more

628
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,780
things to help core development.

629
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:09,980
So the PSF fundraiser is currently running and that is a concrete way to help as well.

630
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,980
Pycon.us slash PSF.

631
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,020
That's where you can find that fundraiser.

632
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,220
That's a great note to end this on.

633
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,460
Thank you all so much for joining us this morning.

634
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,460
Enjoy the rest of Pycon.

635
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,460
Thanks, Eva.

636
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,460
All right.

637
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,660
Why don't you stand up?

638
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,700
Another round of applause for Eva and the steering council.

639
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:37,100
All right.

640
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:41,260
So last reminders.

641
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,260
Job fair and poster session will go until 1 p.m.

642
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:49,220
We'll have another three sessions of talks and then come on back here at 3 10 p.m. for

643
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,580
our closing plenary.

644
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,580
Thanks.

645
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,100
Have a wonderful day.
