1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
So, this is my first lightning talk.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,680
I'm just waiting for my slides to show up.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,960
So my name is Jonathan Biddle.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,640
I lead a team called Developer Acceleration at Wayfair.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,040
And today I'm going to talk to you about one of the ways that we spread best practices

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,080
around Python and Python excellence across the company.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,920
So for those of you who aren't familiar with Wayfair, I'll give you just a really brief

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,560
idea of what we do.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,000
We are an e-commerce website that focuses on furniture and home decor.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,400
And we're kind of big, a little bit.

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,080
We've got 14 million products, 16.4 million customers, which means we're like 2.4 million

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,680
products away from literally having something for everyone.

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,840
And we've also got 2,300 people across our various tech teams.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,400
So what about Python at Wayfair?

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,760
Well, two years ago, I was given the opportunity to do what I think is probably my favorite

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,760
job ever.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,080
And it was basically to figure out how do we make it intuitive and easy for any software

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,120
team to use Python to solve their problems and reach their business objectives in the

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,260
form of a Python platform team at Wayfair.

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,240
One of the things that we thought about early on is like, okay, if we're going to get a

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,280
bunch of people adopting Python, how do we make sure they adopt Python the right way?

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,960
How do we make sure they're using idiomatic Python and leading into some of the Pythonic

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,280
things that may come naturally to you if you've been doing it for a few years but out of the

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,320
gate are a little mystical.

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,280
You don't really understand what Pythonic means.

26
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,200
If we're going to have a bunch of people doing this for the first time, it's kind of important

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,640
that we have a good story here.

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,720
So we could do a lot of training and point people to good books to read and things like

29
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,320
that, but we were concerned that that wouldn't really take in the way we really wanted.

30
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,080
So what we came up with is this model called auxiliary engineering.

31
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,760
And what it is, it's kind of like embedded engineering.

32
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,040
We work with the team on something, but we have two goals.

33
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,400
One, we want that team to be successful.

34
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:07,080
We want them to reach whatever MVP or goal that they have to achieve some business outcome,

35
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,680
but we also want to transform the team in some way.

36
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,080
We want to bring in those best practices that come second nature to us.

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,680
You can recognize any project that we contribute to because we have a little badge and readme

38
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,960
files for any of these projects where we've been involved.

39
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,200
So let's talk about what an auxiliary project looks like.

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,360
There's some preparation before we even get started.

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,240
One thing that's really important, we don't want to force this on anyone.

42
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,240
We don't want to feel like there's some group of experts that are going to come across the

43
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,440
company and then say, oh, no, this is how you should do it.

44
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
We want teams to come to us.

45
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,400
We want them to feel like whatever we're doing is so valuable that they'll kind of reach

46
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,880
across the company and say, hey, could you come and partner with us on this?

47
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,480
We also make sure that we have really clear goals.

48
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,000
We want the software team, our auxiliary engineer, and the product owner to feel like they are

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,220
aligned on a common outcome.

50
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,000
That includes business objectives, but it also might include things like code coverage

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,080
or some bringing in best practice, maybe black or automatic linting pipelines, things like

52
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,240
that.

53
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,720
We also do three-month durations.

54
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,640
Now, yes, that conveniently fits into like a quarter of time, maybe makes planning easy,

55
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,920
but there's another reason that we do three months.

56
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,400
There's some research that shows that it takes about a bit over two months to form a new

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,480
habit, and that's kind of what we feel like we're doing.

58
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,360
We're going to that team, we're working with them, and we're helping them build good habits.

59
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,960
If we were to do this for a few weeks, maybe we'd see some of it, but I have some concerns

60
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,840
that once we leave, they're just going to reach for whatever feels most obvious to them,

61
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,480
and those habits really aren't going to take.

62
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,800
We spend a lot of time just reinforcing and trying to make that what's second nature to

63
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,080
us, second nature to the team.

64
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,520
During a project, it's very important, very important that we are part of that team, not

65
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,280
some outsider who's kind of like advising it.

66
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,400
We are in the team, we are working towards the same goals.

67
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,200
We sit with the team, we do meetings with the team.

68
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,960
We want to feel like we are a member of that team throughout the project.

69
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,260
Also, we pair on the hard work.

70
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,600
We don't take it on ourselves.

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,440
We absolutely do not want to go and solve the hardest problem in a project ourselves

72
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,320
because that robs the team of the ability to learn.

73
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,680
That robs them of the chance to understand really why a particular solution was selected.

74
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,960
So it's important that whenever a hard part of the project shows up, we pair with them.

75
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,920
We make sure that we're passing that knowledge on to whoever else is involved.

76
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,960
We also focus a lot on feedback.

77
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,000
Feedback is very important to us.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,520
So we do weekly retros with the team, specifically on the AuxEngine engagement.

79
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,760
What's going well, what's not going well.

80
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
We talk about the project.

81
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,320
We also talk about our role in the project.

82
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,360
Is it working?

83
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
Is it healthy?

84
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,720
We want to get really good feedback.

85
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,160
We actually encourage teams to give us critical feedback.

86
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,080
If something's not going right, we want to know that and we want to address it.

87
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,800
Which leads well into the learning aspect of this.

88
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,600
It really goes both ways.

89
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,520
It's not like we're bringing a whole bunch of knowledge as experts onto the team and

90
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,160
taking nothing back ourselves.

91
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,000
We get a lot of really good information from this.

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,960
And I say a lot.

93
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,680
It is impossible for us to know what it's like to learn Python for the first time today.

94
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,040
Or what it's like to use our platform for the first time.

95
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,440
But when we're sitting with people and we're watching them get confused because some documentation

96
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,480
wasn't clear, it's extremely obvious.

97
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,240
And we also funnel that into 20% time.

98
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,960
So anyone who's doing auxiliary engineering gets one day a week to just take all of that

99
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,680
information they got in the course of the week, maybe it was something that was unintuitive,

100
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
and address it.

101
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,080
And then we're really self-directed, just take action.

102
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,480
There's no real process to go through.

103
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,600
Just work on improving the platform.

104
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,440
We follow up six months later with the team.

105
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,400
Want to make sure that whatever knowledge that we brought in actually stayed and we're

106
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,520
seeing that take hold.

107
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,940
And often case that is that's what happens.

108
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,080
And actually even gets a little better than that.

109
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,580
We've done this about 10 projects.

110
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,640
A number of them, what we've observed is not only does that team start to become strong,

111
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,160
but the teams adjacent to them start to become strong too.

112
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,200
They start to spread those best practices that we tried to spread.

113
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,120
And the idea of what Python is starts to replicate across the company.

114
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,560
And it's really quite amazing.

115
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,200
There's also a really high demand for this.

116
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,840
It's not like we have to go and find teams to come and like, hey, would you want to work

117
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
with us on this?

118
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,680
No, we actually have to turn away people, unfortunately, every time we go through a

119
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,120
planning cycle.

120
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,080
Because there's just not enough engineers on the platform team to meet that demand.

121
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,360
So that's a really good indicator that what we're doing is extremely valuable.

122
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,680
It's also led to a ton of platform improvements.

123
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,160
Being with the team, seeing what was working well and not working well, make sure that

124
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
we are not...

125
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Okay, this is a clap.

126
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,560
I wasn't sure if you were telling me to cut off because of time.

127
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:57,600
Okay, so we've made a ton of platform improvements just because there's a lot of good feedback

128
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
in that process.

129
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,240
So my name is Jonathan Biddle.

130
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
I work at Wayfair.

131
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,280
You can find me here.

132
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,960
And if you want to talk to me, we have a recruitment booth at the job fair.

133
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
Thank you, Jon.

134
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
Shhh.

135
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Okay.

136
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,000
Will the next person come and sit up over here?

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,280
Number three, you know who you are.

138
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,400
Loading Gmail.

139
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:27,320
So our man really wants to touch this tractor.

140
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:33,440
This is the, you know this thing called the imp of the perverse?

141
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
He wants to touch it.

142
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,840
He knows he shouldn't, but he kind of leans over the velvet ropes and he just touches

143
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,640
the kind of like, what do you call it, the little arch over the front wheel.

144
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,480
And a little shiver goes through him.

145
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
And he looks around.

146
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,560
He's the first person in this whole convention, right?

147
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
There's no one around.

148
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,080
There's no security guards.

149
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,340
And he's already transgressed.

150
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:59,060
So he just goes, okay, well, unhooks the velvet rope, gets himself around and gets just a

151
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,860
little bit closer to this tractor, right?

152
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,340
And he runs his hand across it and walks around the tractor.

153
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,340
It's incredible, right?

154
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,340
This thing is massive.

155
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,340
It's brand new.

156
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,420
The tires are spotless.

157
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,380
He feels them.

158
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,500
And he really gets to know this tractor on the way around.

159
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:22,100
And as he's walking around, he notices the front door of the cab is open.

160
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,460
So he goes, look, well, there's no one here.

161
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,580
Come on.

162
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,180
And he sort of takes a step and then he just climbs into this tractor, sits in it, and

163
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,180
he goes, this feels amazing.

164
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,780
He sat in a few tractors before, but nothing like this.

165
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,020
It's very comfortable.

166
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,020
Cabin is full of all the equipment.

167
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,020
He's read about it.

168
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,940
He's seen a million pictures of what the entire area of this tractor is going to look like.

169
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,980
But being in there is amazing.

170
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:54,940
And then he sees that the keys are in the ignition.

171
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,060
So he had a little fight with his conscience, but in the end he can't resist.

172
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,300
And he leans forwards and he touches the key and he goes, come on, I just want to hear

173
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,020
the engine, all right?

174
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,980
I'll just switch it off straight away, but I just want to hear what it sounds like.

175
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,620
I just want to hear what it sounds like.

176
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,860
So he leans forwards and he turns the engine on.

177
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,540
The engine roars alive, like gently, like modern, powerful engines do.

178
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:29,440
It's not like a blurgh, but it goes, but the power is really evident in this thing.

179
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,940
And then he just loses control, right?

180
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,340
He puts his hand on the steering wheel.

181
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,560
He puts his hand on the gear stick, puts the clutch down, he puts it in gear and he takes

182
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,960
this tractor and he drives it off its podium out into the convention hall through the velvet

183
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,840
ropes, crashing through dozens of exhibits amongst several flimsy panels.

184
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,640
He's just going on a mad tractor rampage, laughing maniacally at himself.

185
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,480
They call in the police, they call in the National Guard, they have to eventually stop

186
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,080
this tractor, they block it with an APC, they wrestle him out of the cab, they drag him

187
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,880
off to jail.

188
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,400
It's quite a scene.

189
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,160
But not as much of a scene as the one that you're about to cause.

190
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,160
In order to welcome our next speaker, please give Breanne a huge, huge welcome.

191
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:25,520
Thank you.

192
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,520
Hi everyone.

193
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,320
My name is Breanne Kaplan and I'm the founder of Code Our Dreams.

194
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,120
We're a 501c3 nonprofit in Chicago.

195
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,720
We serve under-resourced high school students and teach them computer science so they can

196
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,320
build applications that drive positive change in our communities.

197
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,160
So I think we can all agree on two things this morning.

198
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:58,420
Number one, this is my dog Piper and we can all agree that she is super cute.

199
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:06,060
But the second thing, probably more importantly, is that computational thinking is important.

200
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,540
Teachers agree.

201
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:14,380
According to a study by EdSurge, 88% of K-12 teachers said that computer science is crucial

202
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,380
to preparing students for the workforce.

203
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:24,140
And as Pythonese says, we know that STEM education is more than just preparing students to become

204
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,100
scientists, engineers, or mathematicians.

205
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,820
It's just as important as a liberal arts education.

206
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:41,580
But the reality is, with the same study, only 20% of students are actually being reached.

207
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:47,180
So there's a disconnect between the belief that computer science is important and the

208
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,620
actual application of these skills in schools.

209
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:58,860
So the problems, they can be put into four buckets.

210
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,640
The first two, lack of teachers, lack of standardized curriculum.

211
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,780
Over half of public school districts in the nation report struggling to recruit and retain

212
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,060
certified and effective STEM teachers.

213
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:20,780
And this figure raises to 90% in districts serving large proportions of African American

214
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,100
and Hispanic students.

215
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,540
Number three and number four, lack of gear and lack of funding.

216
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:34,500
In Illinois, where I live and where I teach, it has the most unfair school funding system

217
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,860
in the nation, according to a study released by the Education Trust.

218
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:46,060
And in this study, individual schools were underfunded by $2.4 billion.

219
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,740
So I know you're all asking, what can we do?

220
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,700
We really need your help.

221
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:58,580
As a community, let's invest in the schools that have the least.

222
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,100
And this is why I started Code Our Dreams.

223
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,300
As I said, Code Our Dreams is a 501c3 nonprofit in Chicago.

224
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,060
Every student cohort that we teach starts with the question, what communities are you

225
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,100
a part of?

226
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,180
What makes them great and beautiful?

227
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,640
But also, what problems do you see?

228
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:26,040
Our students ideate on applications they can build that address some of those problems.

229
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,960
And then that's the applications that they build throughout the year-long program.

230
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:37,660
They learn everything from ideation to user experience and design, Python programming,

231
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:44,120
and the delivery of the product to showcase to their communities.

232
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,440
And coming this fall, we'll have three different tracks, data science, web development, and

233
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,080
physical computing, all for social good.

234
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:02,320
So there are a few things that we're doing that we think are important and that are different.

235
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,600
So the first is that we think it's important to reach students where they are.

236
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,580
Nearly all of low-performing Chicago high schools are on the south side and sit on or

237
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,280
border the poorest census tracks.

238
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,920
However, the majority of STEM programming occurs in the city center, which is inaccessible

239
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,280
to the majority of students who need it the most.

240
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:31,000
It's really important that we meet the students where they are.

241
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The second is focusing on schools that need it the most.

242
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,200
There's a huge gap between resource versus under-resource schools.

243
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,640
So in Chicago, where I live, I can give two examples.

244
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,440
There is a school up north called Stevenson.

245
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:55,040
That school has an Olympic-sized pool, an espresso bar, two different gyms, and theater

246
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:02,920
performances versus a school in Waukegan, which typically has 28 students to just one

247
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:10,500
computer and their band plays in the hallway because they don't have enough space.

248
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,020
The third thing that we think is important is exposing students to all opportunities

249
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,200
in tech.

250
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,900
Our students have the opportunity to take on the roles from product manager to product

251
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,300
designer, programmer, sales and marketing.

252
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,880
Something in there will resonate with all students, so let's get together and expose

253
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,900
students to everything within tech.

254
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,620
And lastly, I think it's important to empower students to actually create the change that

255
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,020
they seek to see.

256
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:50,420
Our students build applications that make positive impact on their local communities.

257
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:58,740
And if you or your company is interested in sponsoring or donating to 501c3s, please give

258
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,220
me a shout or drop me a business card.

259
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:08,620
You can visit our website at codardreams.org and we'd love to talk to you.

260
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,620
Thank you.

261
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,620
Thank you so much.

262
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,620
Our next talk is Daniel.

263
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,620
Please give him a big hand.

264
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,620
Hi.

265
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,620
Hello.

266
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,620
Hi.

267
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:29,100
This isn't nearly as serious, so I apologize in advance.

268
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,100
So I'm from here, but really from here.

269
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,540
This is my daughter in addition to liking Unicoin.

270
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,420
She also likes Minecraft and I like Minecraft, which is, you know, I thought that might be

271
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,740
worthy of study, but apparently that doesn't actually work as a thing.

272
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,580
But as a result of the research, I ran into this and I like the idea of transforming your

273
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,020
world with the power of Python.

274
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,780
That seems like a good idea.

275
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,300
And the way this sort of works in practice, it's for the Java version of the thing and

276
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:03,100
there's a you take the Java version of the program, you embed it in a server, it exposes

277
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,900
a Java-based plugin framework.

278
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,020
It's built for the Raspberry Pi version of the game.

279
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,620
There's a beautiful Python client that some folks from Python UK has printed on and got

280
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:18,560
to work really well and it works really well to inject content into the game.

281
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,860
So my problem is that this is mostly one way.

282
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,940
You know, you can put stuff in, but what I really want to do is I want to be able to

283
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,940
respond to game events.

284
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,740
You know, players move, you know, blocks change, you know, there's a chicken appear, you want

285
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,460
to do chicken things with it, you know, and anything else that you sort of have this really

286
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,800
sort of rich API that is actually exposed by the game.

287
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,240
So I figured, well, let's see if we can sort of do this with some modern Python and it

288
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,560
turns out there's a thing we can do.

289
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,320
We can write a WebSocket adapter, use that as sort of a transport.

290
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,080
There's this beautiful library called Trio WebSocket, so those folks have been doing

291
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,440
a really good job in getting an asynchronous client that sort of works on that.

292
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,680
We can write something between, I mean, it's big, it's a washer, I don't know, and then

293
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,760
you can sort of write on that.

294
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,320
So the scope of the implementation is we have to write this Java WebSocket plugin.

295
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,480
I mean, there's others, but it's like for web things for web people and I'm not one

296
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
of those.

297
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,040
So we need our own and what we're really doing is serializing and deserializing a bunch of

298
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,960
these Java API things.

299
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,360
And for the sake of actually making it easy to use on the same level as my API, we need

300
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,840
a Python module to hide all those details.

301
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,400
So let's say we have something that looks kind of like this.

302
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,540
We register a bunch of callbacks, we can set blocks, and in this case the idea is to respond

303
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,300
to a player moving and sort of put a block behind them.

304
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,120
In other words, Tron.

305
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,460
So you have something that sort of looks like this.

306
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,340
You've got the game, it talks to the server, the Python client.

307
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,180
What's the current state?

308
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,180
This is the software development life cycle.

309
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,700
This is the proof of concept stage.

310
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,700
So it works.

311
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,140
This actually works.

312
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,980
The Python client can sort of do that and send messages.

313
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,460
The Java thing can send messages to connected clients and so on.

314
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,700
If this is where your nerd is, that's where mine is, you know, let's chat.

315
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,700
Thank you very much for your patience.

316
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,180
All right.

317
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,220
That is definitely the first time I've seen the poof of concept emoji.

318
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
Poof of concept.

319
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,660
My project is the poof of concept stage.

320
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,780
The next speaker is Chaim.

321
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:26,980
Please give him a huge hand.

322
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,980
Good morning, everyone.

323
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,060
I know everyone is having a great beginning to the third day of the conference.

324
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,860
So I'm going to talk quickly about PySlackers because everybody needs more work spaces in

325
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,860
their lives.

326
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,740
Slack has an amazing work space switching interface.

327
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,540
You just switch your interfaces and so you should all make use of it by joining PySlackers.

328
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,060
I'm going to tell you what that is in just a minute.

329
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,060
That's our logo.

330
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,420
It's a Slack for Python.

331
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,900
It's been around for about three years.

332
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:58,300
I actually joined in December and if anybody here has spoken to me at the conference or

333
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,380
in any other time, I participate.

334
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,380
Let's put it that way.

335
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,380
So I joined in December.

336
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,740
In February they were looking for new admins and I was nominated and made an admin.

337
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,300
So there's about 10 of us.

338
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,760
And that was really cool.

339
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,500
And I joined PySlackers because, you know, I do Python at work every day.

340
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,680
But I don't get the community like this every day.

341
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,840
And I wanted to find one.

342
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,100
And I found it on PySlackers.

343
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,380
And it's amazing.

344
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,300
So some information about PySlackers.

345
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,100
We have 21,352 members as of 1230 last night.

346
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,260
I checked a few minutes ago.

347
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,140
We have three more.

348
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,220
79 channels.

349
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:38,180
We make them new channels with thoughtfulness.

350
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,700
So we're open to creating new channels but we like having a channel used and not just

351
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,700
channels that aren't used.

352
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,460
So if there's a new channel that we need, great.

353
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,900
But if not, use one that's there.

354
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,180
90% of the messages are public.

355
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,220
We tend not to use threading.

356
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,460
Like I said, Slack has a great workspace switcher, the threading interface.

357
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,460
Not as much.

358
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,900
But 90% of the messages are public, which is great.

359
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,420
But because there's 20,000 of us, we don't pay for Slack because, well, that would be

360
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,500
kind of insane.

361
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,260
So messages only live for about a week.

362
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,460
So if you're going to join, check things out.

363
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,460
It's amazing.

364
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,500
I'll give you a brief moment to just look at that.

365
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
That's a sampling of our channels.

366
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,260
If you want to find me any other time today and talk about some of them, I'm happy to.

367
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,300
I'm active on more than a few of them.

368
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,580
And that's great.

369
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,580
And I love it.

370
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,380
So I'll leave that up for just a minute.

371
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,060
You can peruse.

372
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,660
And that was 10 seconds, which is plenty.

373
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,660
So join us.

374
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,300
I would love everyone here to join.

375
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,100
I know not a lot of people have heard about it, even though we have 20,000 users.

376
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,940
So if you haven't heard, come check it out.

377
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,340
We get about 150 new users a week.

378
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,480
Because of this presentation that I'm giving, I would love to increase that by an order

379
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,680
of magnitude this week, just so I could say, ha ha, I did that, and that's awesome.

380
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,560
In particular, if anybody is between UTC plus seven and plus 14, which is also known as

381
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,920
minus 10, which I learned last night, and that's amazing that there are two time zones

382
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,760
that are both plus and minus time zones, we don't have as much coverage there.

383
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,760
And we do definitely have users from there that are asking for help in their time zone.

384
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
And things are quiet.

385
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,360
So if you know Python, if you want to help people, and you're in those time zones, please

386
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,080
join because that would be awesome.

387
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
Thank you.

388
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
Again, I'm Chaim Kirby.

389
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,320
I'm not going to give you an email address because if you want to talk to me, you've

390
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,320
got to join.

391
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,320
Thank you, Chaim.

392
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,320
Felipe, are you ready to go?

393
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,320
Then you first, your audience must give him a big welcome, and then he must go.

394
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,320
Hello.

395
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,320
Good morning, everybody.

396
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,480
So Anthony and I, we're here to talk about Conna Forge, a community pattern that works

397
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,640
for you.

398
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,400
And our actual talk is going to be about reinventing the wheel.

399
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,960
Funny thing, our first title was Beyond the Wheel, and then we realized that a better

400
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,040
title would be Work in Progress.

401
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,480
So just a little bit about Conna Forge before we go.

402
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,920
We tried to address all the packaging needs.

403
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:07,280
It's going to be a one-stop shop for all the platforms, Windows, Mac, Linux, ARM, Arch,

404
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,340
Power 89, and NoArch.

405
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:14,780
So if you have to support multiple platforms with a single tool and you need a lot of packages,

406
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,460
Conna Forge is the tool for you.

407
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,500
Conna Forge is big, and it's growing more and more every day.

408
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:27,860
Like we have more than 100,000 artifacts, totaling up to more than 450 gigabytes, spread

409
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:34,260
over 6,000 feedstocks with more than 1,000 maintainers taking care of all these packages.

410
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:39,580
We have so far more than 4,000 pull requests, and I believe we broke the record on GitHub

411
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:45,140
for the repository with the most submodules.

412
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,380
So we're here to talk about wheels, and then I would like to introduce you CondaPress.

413
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:56,180
CondaPress is a new tool that converts Conda packages to wheels.

414
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,540
You can find it on the reorganization CondaPress.

415
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,020
It's a pretty new project.

416
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:06,580
CondaPress tries to address some of the problems mixing PIP and Conda, because that usually

417
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:12,260
ends up with all this ABI incompatibility, so our goal is to try to fix that.

418
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:19,220
Some people may want a package with different builds or newer ABI than the many Linux, like

419
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:29,180
for example, if you want a TensorFlow with a different, like say a latest GCLIP.

420
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,180
And Conda has a lot of packages that are not on wheels, so maybe we can try to port

421
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,220
those over there as well.

422
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,580
Now because I'm not crazy enough to speak a foreign language and do a demo, I'm going

423
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,700
to hand it over to Anthony, and he's going to show you.

424
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,460
Hey, everybody.

425
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,020
Let's get out of presentation mode here.

426
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:56,300
So we're going to go ahead and build up a little Conda index here with CondaPress.

427
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:04,740
So here what we're doing is we're going to build a wheel for Python 3.8 using a CondaForge's

428
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,740
3.8 package.

429
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,420
So we're going to go ahead and run this.

430
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:20,460
Oops, sorry, time dot dash P. And you can see this is actually just taking the actual

431
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,860
CondaForge artifact, so the tarball, and then turning that into a wheel without doing a

432
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,100
lot of extra things, right?

433
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,880
It's not rebuilding that package.

434
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,700
What it's doing is hopefully, assuming I'm connected to the internet.

435
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,140
No, I'm not connected to the internet.

436
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,900
So the, oh no.

437
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,900
Live demos, boo.

438
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,180
That's why I didn't want to do it.

439
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,180
Yeah.

440
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,260
Okay, so let's turn off the Wi-Fi.

441
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,660
Let's turn it back on.

442
00:25:52,660 --> 00:26:01,860
This was literally working a couple seconds ago.

443
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:09,940
And I am going to try hotspotting right now.

444
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,700
But it looks like we might be back on PyCon.

445
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,860
So let's try it again.

446
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,860
And yes, no.

447
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,020
Yes, there we go.

448
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:27,180
So right now it's converting these things.

449
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:32,100
What it's doing is it's taking all the metadata out of those tarballs and repackaging them

450
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,660
into metadata that wheels understands, moving all the files around such that in a way that

451
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,220
is meaningful.

452
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,100
Oh, come on, people.

453
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,100
What's going on?

454
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,220
Why is it taking so long?

455
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,140
So is the internet really that bad here?

456
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,140
Yes.

457
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,140
Okay, let's select network here.

458
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,420
And do I need to disconnect?

459
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,980
Oh, yeah, let's connect to my personal one.

460
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,460
And hopefully this works.

461
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,460
Come on.

462
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,460
Big money.

463
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:13,380
Failing space because space needs to be filled.

464
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,860
Wow, that took a long time.

465
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,340
So hopefully we're on the right network.

466
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,940
Okay, it's going again.

467
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,340
Hopefully this actually works.

468
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:27,060
And it gets to the next package.

469
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,060
There we go.

470
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,060
Okay.

471
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,060
It looks like it's actually moving now.

472
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,780
So right now what it's doing is it's also walking the dependency tree.

473
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,940
So it's going and actually getting the runtime libraries and taking the artifacts for those

474
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,340
runtime libraries, building those.

475
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,180
Right now that's what it's doing with libgcc.

476
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:52,100
You'll see it do open SSL and SQL light and all of the things that term info and TK and

477
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,820
all of the things that Python depends on.

478
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,620
And it only took 30 seconds once it's actually working.

479
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,540
You see all of the wheels for these crazy packages.

480
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,020
We've got a virtual M down here.

481
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,740
So you can see it's clean.

482
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:10,620
It's a clean virtual M. So if you do Python dash dash version.

483
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,380
Sorry, I don't normally use bash, right?

484
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,740
This is this.

485
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:21,460
But now because we have these wheels, we can point pip to the local index directory where

486
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:28,020
things live, tell it not to go use PyPI and then install this Python 3.8 wheel.

487
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:33,540
It'll install all those packages as normal, resolve them, and now if we go ahead and we

488
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:38,860
run Python dash version, bam, we have just pip installed Python 3.8 here.

489
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:44,620
This works for all packages.

490
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:50,620
If you want make, if you want CMake, if you want GDAL or other crazy packages, yeah, this

491
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,100
is where we're come talk to us.

492
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,100
And there we go.

493
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,100
We're done.

494
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,100
Bye, bye, bye.

495
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,460
Thank you very much.

496
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,900
So up next is some regional Python conference announcements.

497
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,220
Would you like to announce them, Dustin?

498
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,540
In case you didn't know, in case you didn't know, in case you didn't know, there's lots

499
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,780
of regional PyCons that happen as well.

500
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,420
One is happening close to you.

501
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,020
It's smaller than this PyCon but it should be a lot of fun as well.

502
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,380
So we're going to introduce a bunch of regional ones and announce their dates.

503
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,380
Starting with PyCon.

504
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,180
So our usual rule for conference announcements is one slide, one minute.

505
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,580
It's going to be one slide, one sentence.

506
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,420
Just make it a really good sentence.

507
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:30,500
Everyone don't clap between the announcements because otherwise it will take forever.

508
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,820
Everyone please assume your claps are there and then go as quickly as you can.

509
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,180
Clap all the speakers now in advance.

510
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,820
Clap all the previous speakers.

511
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,740
Clap everyone that's involved in PyCon in any kind of way.

512
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,620
Regional conferences, go.

513
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,620
Okay.

514
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,820
PyCon CZ will be in Ostrava.

515
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,060
We have a PyData track.

516
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:53,180
So if you want to do data mining in an actual former coal mine, come to PyCon CZ.

517
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,180
Hello.

518
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:00,620
So you have to choose one and only one conference.

519
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,620
Don't trust anyone else.

520
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,980
It has to be PyLondinium.

521
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,380
We have the Spice Girl coming before that weekend.

522
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,380
It's in June.

523
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,540
We have the Backstreet Boy afterwards.

524
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,540
We have amazing speakers.

525
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,180
Check the schedule.

526
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,180
And all the profit from the conference are going directly to the C Python core developer

527
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,180
sprints.

528
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:21,020
Oh, yeah, there's also a Donald Duck week, but I think it's not the right audience.

529
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:26,380
Also if you have to choose only one conference, go to EuroPython this year.

530
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,300
It's July 8 to the 14th.

531
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,300
It's in Basel.

532
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,620
If you have gone to EuroPython before, you know it's an amazing conference.

533
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,080
You cannot miss it.

534
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,720
If you like Python in Ohio, PyOhio is in this summer.

535
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,440
The weather will be nicer.

536
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,060
Most likely no promises.

537
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,280
It's in Columbus, Ohio.

538
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,640
The CFP is open through May 12.

539
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,280
Registration is free.

540
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:57,360
And we're looking for sponsors to help keep it free.

541
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,160
I am the very model of a Django AUCFP.

542
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,040
I cover complex, yes, but also elementally.

543
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,360
I'll take your talks on testing and contributing to open source on data and converting ASCII

544
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,360
into Morse.

545
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,880
About stack automation and on scientific things of note, the packages you love to use and

546
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,000
engineering anecdote.

547
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,160
Your team work hacks disaster plans and writing docs for all that code on what to do and all

548
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,120
your applications overload.

549
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,480
In short, on topics both complex and also elementally, I am the very model of a PyCon

550
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,920
AUCFP.

551
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,360
We are having our first ever PyCon Africa.

552
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,120
So this is the first one.

553
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
It's very important.

554
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,360
It is going to be a group of people from across the continent.

555
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,880
Africa is a continent.

556
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,600
For those of you who are not aware, the weather is going to be amazing.

557
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,920
It's in Accra, Ghana.

558
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,400
It's so much better than the weather here.

559
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,800
So the CFP is open right now until June 1.

560
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,040
So please come and give a talk.

561
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Thanks.

562
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:06,000
Well, PyBay is happening on the third weekend of August.

563
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,240
We have two days of workshops and about 60 talks this year.

564
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,600
And we are taking CFP until the 12th.

565
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,140
We are likely going to sell out this year at 800 people.

566
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,080
So please do come get a ticket.

567
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:24,760
And we are running a special with discounts this week for PyCon members.

568
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,760
Thank you.

569
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,040
All right.

570
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,800
So we are here for PyCon Latam.

571
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:37,040
It's going to happen in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, August 29 to 31.

572
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,880
Call for proposals end of this month.

573
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:48,000
And we're going to have two tracks, English and Spanish.

574
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,800
And also, repping for Euro Sci-Fi 2019 in Bilbao, in the Basque Country in the north

575
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,840
of Spain, September 2 to 6.

576
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,200
And call for proposals end May 12.

577
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:07,080
Thank you.

578
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:12,320
So is this our slide?

579
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,320
Next slide.

580
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,840
Do I have to hit it?

581
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,840
Sorry, I didn't know.

582
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,840
So, okay.

583
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,120
Both the Gold Rush and the Silver Rush proved that Colorado had way more hidden beauty than

584
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,280
one could see in their eye.

585
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,680
Our sunsets inspired America the Beautiful.

586
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,580
Our peaks make the picturesque skyline of the American West.

587
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:34,480
And this September, we invite you to Denver, the mile-high city, the queen city of the

588
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,240
plains and the inaugural location of PyColorado.

589
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,600
CFP's open 11 more days and tickets are still selling.

590
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
Thanks.

591
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:48,160
PyCon JP, PyCon Japan, Tokyo.

592
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,400
This year, middle of September, CFP opened.

593
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,200
Japanese and English is available.

594
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,520
Please contact us.

595
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
Thank you.

596
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,000
Okay, 20 seconds.

597
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,400
I think keynotes make a conference memorable, so I want to give a big warm welcome to KLR

598
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Sloan, Andrew Godwin, Maria Mitrovich, Nicoleta Ginassi to make the next PyCon Balkan memorable.

599
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,080
It's from the 3rd to 5th of October in Belgrade, Serbia, just across the pond.

600
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,640
Thank you very much.

601
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,720
You should all come to PyGotham in New York City this October 4th and 5th.

602
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,600
Our call for proposals is open now through May 12th anywhere on earth.

603
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,360
There are going to be 600 people, 60 talks, and a great time.

604
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,400
If you'd like to help us choose our schedule, we have public voting opening shortly after

605
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,040
our call for proposals end.

606
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,960
Find out full details at 2019.pygotham.org.

607
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,520
You know what I'm going to say, right?

608
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,920
You have to use one and only one conference, okay?

609
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:53,600
If you're into good food, good weather, and going to the beach, what are you doing here?

610
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,040
Come to PyCon Spain.

611
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,920
It's in October.

612
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
Check out the schedule.

613
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,920
It's going to be published in a month.

614
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,520
We're still getting proposals, so send your proposals, and maybe you can be a speaker

615
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,520
there as well.

616
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
Thank you.

617
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
All right.

618
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:17,520
This is not mine, but we have SyPyLadam in Bogota on October 8th to 10th.

619
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:24,320
We also have PyCon DE in Pydata Berlin coming up October 9th to 11th.

620
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,120
Finally, okay, North Bay Python in Petaluma, California, which is just an hour's head of

621
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,120
San Francisco.

622
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,520
This is our third year running a two-day single track event in beautiful wine country.

623
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,840
CFPB will open July 1st.

624
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,640
We run November 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.

625
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
Thank you.

626
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,640
Hey, everybody.

627
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
I'm Elaine.

628
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,840
I'd like to invite you all to PyCon Canada.

629
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,200
It's taking place in November 16th to 19th because you should all come to Toronto in

630
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
middle of November.

631
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,480
I hear great things about it.

632
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,160
Our CFP is currently open.

633
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,560
Check it out at PyCon.ca.

634
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,040
I stole this talk from John, so like he said, you should propose a talk on any topic that

635
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,840
would be of interest to the Python community.

636
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,340
So check out our website.

637
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,440
We have stickers.

638
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,440
Come see me.

639
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,720
We're also looking for volunteers or Alex.

640
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,200
We're also looking for volunteers who are interested in helping out, and we're also

641
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,520
looking for sponsors.

642
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,960
So thank you.

643
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,080
And I just want to also announce that PyCon Columbia is taking place in February of next

644
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
year.

645
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,840
The dates are there, February 7th, 8th, and 9th.

646
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:30,560
Any questions, please go to the website, and they have a Twitter at the bottom.

647
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Thanks.

648
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,020
Hi, I'm Armer Kramer, organized PyTexas.

649
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,160
We just had our PyTexas 2019 conference on April 13th.

650
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
It was great.

651
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160
It was our biggest win yet.

652
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,480
We would love to see you in 2020.

653
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
We've got our act together.

654
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,560
We're looking at our dates, May 16th and 17th, and Austin, if you want to help us, you want

655
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:53,480
to find out more about us, go to PyTexas.org or follow us on Twitter.

656
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,080
PyCascades next year is in Portland during the rainy time.

657
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
Please come.

658
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,080
It is lovely.

659
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,920
Hey, I'm here.

660
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,360
I wanted to talk to you a little bit about PyCon Argentina.

661
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,480
We have a really nice PyCon there.

662
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
It's rather big.

663
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,000
Last year it was in Buenos Aires.

664
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,640
We had almost 1,000 attendees.

665
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,120
Next year it's going to be in Buenos Aires too.

666
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,040
With your help, it's probably going to be bigger even.

667
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,520
We have a really nice community, a really nice country.

668
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,920
It's free, so no excuse.

669
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,480
If you wanted to know Argentina, this is a great excuse to go.

670
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,360
Hey, everybody.

671
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,800
My name is Andy.

672
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,480
Would you like to see a PyCarolinas?

673
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
I would.

674
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
There isn't one right now.

675
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,920
This is a call for action.

676
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,480
Please help make me happen.

677
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,040
We have an open space at 10 a.m. in room 22 to start kicking things off.

678
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,600
You can contact me at automationpanda.com.

679
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,940
Please I really want this conference.

680
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,940
Thank you.

681
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,940
Thank you very much.

682
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,940
Thank you.

683
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,940
I'm not on.

684
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,940
Thank you very much.

685
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,560
Thanks to each and every single one of all the speakers for the regional conferences,

686
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,720
including the ones that announced not their own conferences but other people's conferences.

687
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,720
Thank you to Dustin, my co-host.

688
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,720
Give him a big hand.

689
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,400
He's going to be up on stage next year.

690
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,160
Look how much more attractive he is than I am.

691
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,040
It's going to be so much better for you all.

692
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,760
The end of the tractor joke can be found online or you can ask me afterwards.

693
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,480
But, actually, that's not how it works, is it?

694
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,240
That's not what we do, right?

695
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,680
What we'll do is we'll do the end of the tractor joke at PyCon 2020, which is in Pittsburgh.

696
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,680
I'm sure it's going to be great.

697
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,120
And that's a reason you can all look forward to it.

698
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,520
So just remember where we are in that one.

699
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,200
So yes, thanks to all of our lightning talk speakers.

700
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,580
And thanks to each and every one of you for filling up this room.

701
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,960
Here is the last day of PyCon.

702
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,220
You've all been beautiful.

703
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,500
I'm so glad you're all here.

704
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,940
I'm so glad they're all here.

705
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:47,060
Please give a massive, massive, massive round of applause to all the lightning talk speakers

706
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,060
all day.

707
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,060
All the ones that we missed that weren't here.

708
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,500
All the ones that are going to come back next year.

709
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,460
All of you guys are going to propose a talk.

710
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,580
If you've never done a talk before, please do a lightning talk and enjoy the rest of

711
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,580
the conference.

712
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,660
And now, a word from our sponsors.
