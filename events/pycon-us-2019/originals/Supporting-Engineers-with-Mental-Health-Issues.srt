00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here's with mental health issues by Jenna Quindica.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hi.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Good afternoon.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Thanks for joining me here.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Thank you to the PyCon staff, volunteers, everyone on the selection committee.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You know, if you see someone with a volunteer staff badge, make sure to thank them for putting

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
together a wonderful event.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That would be great.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm really happy to be here in Cleveland and at PyCon.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's dive in.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
My friend Matt describes me as a software magician and senior oops engineer.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I've been working in tech for five years.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I've worked at a handful of startups in upstate New York, Los Angeles in the Bay Area, currently

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
based in SF.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A good friend of mine gifted me this grumpy little badge.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm so happy to be here.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm so happy to be here.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm a software engineer.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm also not a medical professional.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
None of this that you are going to hear today is medical advice.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm going to say this over and over again.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is not a medical advice.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I've got a bunch of medical advice that I'm going to talk about here.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't know if you can see the resemblance between me and my doctor.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm a software engineer.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm also not a medical professional.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
None of this that you are going to hear today is medical advice.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,640
I'm going to say this over and over again.

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
This is not medical advice.

31
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,160
We're going to take a sec right now to check in.

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm going to be talking about mental illness, my personal story, things that people can

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,080
do to make the workplace more inclusive.

34
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,840
If you're not in the right head space to be listening to this talk, I definitely encourage

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,760
you to get up and leave and feel free to change your mind at any time.

36
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,040
Just feel free to bow out at any time.

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,320
It won't offend me.

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,080
I volunteer with open sourcing mental illness, OSMI, a nonprofit changing the way we talk

39
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,840
about mental health and the tech community.

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,840
Towards the end, I'll talk more about how OSMI can help you.

41
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,640
For the rest of the conference, I'll be hanging out at the OSMI booth.

42
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,480
Come say hi.

43
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:10,920
I'm actually sitting right across from a guy autographing his books on intro to Python.

44
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,000
That's how you can find me.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,440
What do I want to accomplish this afternoon?

46
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,200
I want you to walk away from this talk feeling more comfortable discussing mental health

47
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,840
during everyday life and in the workplace.

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
And why me?

49
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,240
I get this question a lot.

50
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,160
Things have been rough for me lately.

51
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,040
My friend Matt would say that that's an understatement.

52
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,120
Matt is actually a fellow volunteer with open sourcing mental illness.

53
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,840
When I first started speaking at conferences about mental health in May 2018, I mentioned

54
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,040
how difficult 2017 was for me.

55
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,520
2017 was really bad.

56
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,760
The thing with mental illness is that while things may get better over time, unfortunately,

57
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,840
your mental health can and sometimes will regress.

58
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,000
I feel like I'm coming out of a rut myself right now, mostly because I didn't used to

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,960
know how to effectively communicate what I was going through, and this meant that people

60
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,120
didn't know how to help me.

61
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,200
I'm still not great at communicating my emotions, but I've gotten to a place where it's clear

62
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,320
to me how to get better at communicating, which is to practice, practice, practice.

63
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,960
So I'm giving this talk because, one, I've been there.

64
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,880
I'm currently there.

65
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,880
And I want people to know they're not alone.

66
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,320
Two, I'm practicing communicating.

67
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,000
This is for me.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,560
Practicing how to advocate for myself and my mental health issues.

69
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,320
And three, I want to empower you to start talking about mental health.

70
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,960
I've learned a lot these past couple years through treatment, and the content I'll be

71
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,080
sharing today is separated into two parts, education and advocacy.

72
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,760
You can't support engineers with mental health issues unless you know what having a mental

73
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,880
health issue means, and it's different for everyone, but there are some common themes.

74
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,640
In the education part, I'm going to talk a lot about what I've tried to take care of

75
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,440
myself because I want you to know what's out there.

76
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,600
The advocacy portion will include actionable steps you can take to make your workplace

77
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,680
more inclusive to people with mental health issues.

78
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,120
Remember, not a doctor or a medical professional.

79
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,200
None of this is medical advice.

80
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,920
Let's get down to business.

81
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,480
I've been dealing with depression for a long time, essentially ever since I can remember.

82
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,680
The thing is, I'm just too tired to buy things or do things or get things or say things or

83
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,760
face things.

84
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,840
That's from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, a romantic comedy musical TV show about mental health.

85
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,400
I highly recommend it.

86
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,640
The season finale was a couple weeks ago, and the whole series is on Netflix now.

87
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,640
I checked.

88
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,560
It's actually on Netflix in the U.S.

89
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,840
I'm not the only one who is depressed.

90
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,800
Clinical depression affects 7.1% of American adults every year.

91
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,480
That's about 17 million people, and depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide,

92
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,600
and is a major contributor to the global burden of disease.

93
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,120
What even is depression?

94
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,720
For me, and depression can manifest pretty differently for different people, depression

95
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,720
follows this pattern.

96
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
I start oversleeping.

97
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,480
I can't really get out of bed in the morning.

98
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,120
I start to roll into the office later than I usually do, which leads to being late to

99
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,120
work.

100
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,000
I used to commute from San Francisco to Redwood City, which is about 24 miles via a Cal train,

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,960
and I often want to be able to make that last express train southbound, so I would have

102
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,360
to take the local, which makes every stop.

103
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,480
It would take me over an hour door to door to get to work, so it compounds.

104
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,200
I can sleep for 10 to 12 hours a night.

105
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,240
Basically I get home at 8 p.m. and pass out until 8 a.m.

106
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,640
I become irritable at home and at work, and if you know me, I am not very fun to be around

107
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,680
when I'm irritable.

108
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,840
My friends get on my nerves, and I start to withdraw so that they don't see my irritation

109
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,120
I like to hide.

110
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,320
Basic stuff stops happening, like taking out the trash, doing the dishes, doing my laundry.

111
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,760
Yes, I have definitely purchased more underwear because I ran out of clean underwear and didn't

112
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,960
want to do laundry.

113
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,280
Lastly, the symptom of depression that I hate the most, I fall prey to cognitive distortions.

114
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,200
I'm going to share more about cognitive distortions, but before we do that, I'm going to talk briefly

115
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,320
about anxiety.

116
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,720
So anxiety can manifest pretty differently for different people.

117
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,040
For me, it's like this.

118
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,200
Boo!

119
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,240
I can go from calm to anxious in less than a second.

120
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,080
Anxiety sneaks up on me.

121
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,800
Sometimes I don't know why I'm anxious, and it takes me some time to figure out what's

122
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,440
going on.

123
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,720
I wore a breathing monitor for a while that would vibrate whenever I had a spike in number

124
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,560
of breaths per minute.

125
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,920
This is a good proxy for anxiety.

126
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,680
Turns out, I get anxious whenever I get into an Uber or Lyft.

127
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,880
A good way to picture anxiety is as mind weasels.

128
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,840
They're things that run around your mind, wreaking havoc.

129
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,840
I can't sleep at night when I'm anxious.

130
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,400
I have difficulty falling asleep and difficulty staying asleep.

131
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,720
If you ever get a you up message from me at 3 a.m., just know that it's not a booty call,

132
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,440
but rather that I'm experiencing anxiety and want to talk to a friend.

133
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,920
My Apple Watch reports a highly fluctuating heart rate on particularly anxiety-ridden

134
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
days.

135
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,080
Sometimes I look at my heart rate data for the past 24 hours, I see that it's spiky,

136
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,080
and only then does it occur to me that I was actually anxious.

137
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,960
And the last symptom worth mentioning is that I get nauseous, and sometimes I'll actually

138
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,960
throw up.

139
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,800
That's not really funny, but I don't know why I'm laughing.

140
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,920
If that can be a bit meta for a sec, preparing for this talk made me super anxious, especially

141
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,080
as I was walking around the exhibition hall this morning and people actually said they

142
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,480
remembered seeing my talk in the program and were planning to come.

143
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,920
Thanks for coming.

144
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,000
You know who you are.

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Circling back to cognitive distortions.

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,760
I learned about cognitive distortions and cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT.

147
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,480
Cognitive distortions are thoughts that cause individuals to perceive reality inaccurately.

148
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,600
They're irrational thoughts.

149
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,160
Cognitive behavioral therapy provides a framework for addressing your cognitive distortions.

150
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,600
So here are some examples.

151
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,520
All or nothing thinking.

152
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,120
Everything is bad.

153
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,680
Nothing is good.

154
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Jumping to conclusions.

155
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,440
Hey, everyone got invited to a meeting.

156
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Except me.

157
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,440
I must be getting fired.

158
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,880
Catastrophicizing.

159
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
The site's down.

160
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,440
It's going to be down forever, and I'm going to get fired.

161
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,880
Magnification or minimization.

162
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,880
I'm giving this talk, and I didn't really nail the introduction.

163
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,240
I sucked at giving my talk.

164
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Tunnel vision.

165
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,880
I hate my job.

166
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,760
Therefore, I hate everything.

167
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,200
Discounting or disqualifying the positive.

168
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,520
My manager pays my work, but I'm still bad at my job.

169
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,200
Cognitive distortions are rough.

170
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,520
When you start to believe and internalize them, cognitive distortions make you feel

171
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,480
worse about yourself because it's hard to remember what's true, what's good, who loves

172
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,280
you and who cares about you.

173
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,320
One way to work through a cognitive distortion is to use a thought record.

174
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
So what's a thought record?

175
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,600
It's a worksheet you can fill out in this order.

176
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,640
It's an algorithm.

177
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Describe the situation.

178
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
Use facts.

179
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
What happened?

180
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
Where?

181
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
When?

182
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
With whom?

183
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
How?

184
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Describe the emotion.

185
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,120
How intense was it?

186
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,700
How did you feel it in your body?

187
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,280
Write the negative automatic thought.

188
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,320
Okay.

189
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,520
And so you're having this automatic thought, negative automatic thought.

190
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,600
What are some things that support this thought?

191
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,760
Is there any evidence against that thought?

192
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,800
If so, what are they?

193
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,200
Now write an alternative, more realistic and balanced perspective and check in.

194
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,320
How are you feeling now?

195
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,560
I found thought records hard to fill out at first because when I'm feeling awful, my mind

196
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,280
races and jumps from one judgment or distortion to another very quickly, but I try to take

197
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,260
a deep breath and focus.

198
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,120
If I can slow my thoughts down, then I'm able to piece apart the distortion with a thought

199
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,960
record.

200
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
It's really hard.

201
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:49,560
In therapy, you can get a ton of practice going through a thought record with a therapist.

202
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,520
Therapy can be really scary and daunting.

203
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,120
As an engineer, what I find scary are the things that are unknown.

204
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,200
For example, if I'm on a tight deadline and I don't yet know how long something will take,

205
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
I get scared.

206
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:11,120
Recently, having to deploy a WordPress site on short notice scared the shit out of me.

207
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Exactly the same with therapy.

208
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,400
I didn't know how long it would take to feel better, I didn't know what steps I would have

209
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,960
to take to get better, and I still don't know.

210
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,800
My therapist doesn't tell me when I can expect to get better.

211
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,760
It may just be me, though.

212
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,920
If I were to go back and start therapy from scratch, I would approach therapy like how

213
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,080
I approach pair programming.

214
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,320
Therapy in my experience is collaborative.

215
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,880
The therapist is like a teaching assistant or a more senior engineer or an engineer who

216
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,760
simply knows more about a topic than me.

217
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,880
I can expect that my therapist will catch me before I write a bug or have a cognitive

218
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,480
distortion.

219
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,640
A caveat that, like many relationships, there are therapists that work for you and therapists

220
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
who don't.

221
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,440
It is normal to have to shop around for a therapist.

222
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,800
I saw maybe five therapists before I settled on the therapist who I see currently, and

223
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,680
I've been seeing him for the past two years.

224
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,360
I've definitely heard of people finding a great therapist right away, but please don't

225
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,000
get demoralized if it takes some time to find the right therapist.

226
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,760
You're probably wondering, how do you know if a therapist is right for you?

227
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:20,720
I can't answer this for you, but some questions I'd ask post initial appointment are, do my

228
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,800
therapists still trust?

229
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,280
If not, do I think there's potential for me to trust this therapist?

230
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,520
Do I communicate effectively with this therapist?

231
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,480
I start there and see how things go.

232
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,760
Remember, this is not medical advice.

233
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,560
This is how I think about therapy.

234
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,800
I'm not you, and I'm not in your head.

235
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,120
It's been about five years that I've been actively working on my mental health.

236
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,240
I'm going to go quickly through some of the other things that I've tried.

237
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,160
There's no slide for these because there are too many things to enumerate on a single slide.

238
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,040
If you have any questions about these, please feel free to follow up with me later.

239
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,480
Keep in mind, I did not try all of these things at once or necessarily in this order.

240
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,080
It's an unordered list.

241
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,920
Oh, not that.

242
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,720
I've done individual cognitive behavioral therapy.

243
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,120
I've done couples counseling.

244
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,880
I've seen a psychiatrist.

245
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:18,160
I've taken psychiatric medications, antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, mood stabilizers, and atypical

246
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
antipsychotics.

247
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
I've attended a depression skills group.

248
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,040
I've attended a depression support group.

249
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
They're different.

250
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,040
I've facilitated a depression support group.

251
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,520
I've attended a dialectical behavioral therapy skills group.

252
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:38,360
I've seen an anxiety therapist, and I've tried meditation apps like Calm and Headspace.

253
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,560
I am currently looking into taking a course on mindfulness-based stress reduction.

254
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,560
It's a lot.

255
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,760
It's not even everything that's out there.

256
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,040
There are lots of really fun new therapies coming out.

257
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,280
The research that's happening in the mental health industry is amazing.

258
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,800
What I've been most excited about in the past year or so is this FDA-approved digital pill

259
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
of Billify.

260
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:07,600
It's a digital pill because it's a medication embedded with a sensor that can tell doctors

261
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,720
whether and when patients take their medicine.

262
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,320
The medication I'm talking about is called Billify, which is used to treat schizophrenia

263
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
and bipolar disorder.

264
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,960
I asked my doctor if I could be prescribed the digital pill version of Billify, and she

265
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:26,160
said that taking a medication because it's cool is not a reason to take medicine, unfortunately

266
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
for me.

267
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,320
Also, it's expensive and probably not covered by health insurance.

268
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,020
But hey, you know, it's out there.

269
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,000
People are innovating in this space.

270
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,520
I want to tell you a little more about dialectical behavioral therapy because I don't think many

271
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,320
people know about it.

272
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,400
I personally had never heard of it before two years ago.

273
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,600
So dialectical behavioral therapy, according to Psychology Today, provides clients with

274
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,640
new skills to manage painful emotions and decrease conflict in relationships.

275
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,840
It's a protocol that was developed by a female professor of psychology named Marsha Linehan

276
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,480
for treating those with borderline personality disorder.

277
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,480
DBT specifically focuses on providing therapeutic skills in four key areas.

278
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:18,400
Mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.

279
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,520
What's unique about DBT as compared to CBT is its focus on acceptance of a patient's

280
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:30,600
experience while balancing the work needed to change negative behaviors.

281
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,600
That sounds great, right?

282
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,640
A while ago, my psychiatrist signed me up for a DBT skills group, and I went to class

283
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
once.

284
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,280
I didn't exactly have a pleasant experience.

285
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,160
See the first thing they have you do, at least in this group, is you sit in silence for 15

286
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
minutes.

287
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,880
So you arrive on time to sit in silence for 15 minutes.

288
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,400
You're supposed to clear your head, stop thinking, practice mindfulness.

289
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,600
And as I tried to follow instructions, all I could think about was how uncomfortable

290
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,920
that chair was.

291
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,320
I have a lot of chronic pain in my back and neck because, you know, I'm a software engineer

292
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,120
who hunches over a keyboard all day, and those 15 minutes were uncomfortable enough for me

293
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,760
to decide that DBT was not for me and that I would not go back for the foreseeable future.

294
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,720
Over a year later, I finally decided I was ready to go back.

295
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
I needed it.

296
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,280
And I made sure that I was prepared mentally for that mindfulness activity that they would

297
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,400
start with.

298
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,160
The thing that I hated most about those 15 minutes, you know, I just said chronic pain,

299
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,280
but it's really about what kind of dark thoughts come when you have nothing to do and you're

300
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,720
just sitting there and you're waiting, and you're not supposed to be waiting, right?

301
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,960
You're supposed to be clearing your head.

302
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,560
Anyway, it's very uncomfortable for me.

303
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,680
I'm telling you this so you're better prepared than I was for that first group if you decide

304
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,880
to pursue dialectical behavioral therapy.

305
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,160
My favorite thing I've learned in DBT is self-soothing, which falls under the distress

306
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
tolerance umbrella.

307
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,640
Self-soothing is exactly what you think it is.

308
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,480
There are ways to cope in stressful situations that don't involve substances like alcohol

309
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,120
or weed or other drugs.

310
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,520
When I first moved to San Francisco from LA, I lost my big self-soothing skills.

311
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,120
I could not go to the beach anymore.

312
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,120
The beach in SF sucks.

313
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,040
I'm just going to go out and say that.

314
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,400
It wasn't until I took a DBT skills group course that I re-learned how to self-soothe.

315
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,040
Here's some of my curated self-soothing skills.

316
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:41,160
I pulled these from the book DBT Skills Training Handbooks and Worksheets, second edition.

317
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,760
Watch the sunrise or sunset.

318
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,680
One of my favorite ways to watch the sunset is while driving along the California coast.

319
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,040
Not that I drive, I don't drive.

320
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,160
I beg friends to drive me or sometimes Lyft drivers.

321
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:02,040
You can walk in a pretty part of town, anywhere with trees or cool architecture or grass.

322
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Sing to your favorite songs.

323
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,400
You don't have to sing well.

324
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,000
Just sing.

325
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,120
You can listen to soothing music.

326
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,720
Sample flavors in an ice cream store.

327
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,520
I'm lactose intolerant, so I have to take like five lactates, but it's worth it.

328
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,080
Take a long hot bath or shower.

329
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:29,200
I don't know if you noticed, but we all got bath bombs in our PyCon swag bag.

330
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,960
You can wrap up in a blanket like a burrito.

331
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,880
The other big part of DBT that I use all the time is the concept of wise mind, which falls

332
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,280
under the mindfulness umbrella.

333
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,260
Wise mind is the idea that you can make a decision that satisfies your emotional side

334
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,720
and your cognitive or intellectual side.

335
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,420
Which choice makes you feel good and is also smart?

336
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,580
People using wise mind are able to recognize and respect their feelings while responding

337
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,420
to them in a rational manner.

338
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:05,260
If you'd like to learn more about DBT, I recommend finding a DBT therapist or asking your current

339
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,700
therapist if they can do DBT with you.

340
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,900
DBT skills groups are great too, but they're expensive and often have strict rules on who

341
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,860
qualifies for them.

342
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:21,340
I've also found it difficult to get access to a group because the wait list is full.

343
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,780
What I've seen is that you have to be in weekly individual therapy to be accepted into the

344
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,380
group and some people are more strict than others.

345
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,340
For example, my therapist went out of town for a month and I didn't qualify for the group

346
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,340
anymore.

347
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,420
Asking for help is hard.

348
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,580
We grow up thinking that people who ask for help are weak.

349
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,420
They can't figure stuff out on their own.

350
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,820
We ask ourselves, what's wrong with them?

351
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,660
This is the stigma talking.

352
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,620
Asking for help means you've acknowledged your blind spots and can trust that someone

353
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,300
not only knows better than you, but they can help you.

354
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,780
We come across this all the time when we're mentoring junior engineers.

355
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,180
We want them to be resourceful, but there is a learning curve and we have to respect

356
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,860
that learning curve.

357
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:14,580
Being in treatment for me means I'm constantly iterating on myself.

358
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,580
Humor me for a second.

359
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,140
I'm going to frame therapy as an agile sprint.

360
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,100
The time between therapy appointments is like a sprint.

361
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,580
You are actively working on yourself.

362
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,100
Finishing tickets, moving them to done status.

363
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,500
Then you go to therapy and you do your retrospective for 30 minutes.

364
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,900
How did the past week go?

365
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,940
How successful were the skills that you practiced?

366
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,580
Then you do sprint planning for the second half.

367
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,580
And there are OKRs.

368
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,860
For me, my OKR is living the life I want to live based on my values.

369
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,340
So for example, a good OKR could be building and or maintaining three close friendships

370
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,380
within a year.

371
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,900
Or traveling four times a year.

372
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,780
The therapist can help you reach your goals.

373
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:05,260
I mean, that's kind of what they're there for.

374
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,260
Going back.

375
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,820
One of my closest friends provides a sit rep, a situation report, to his therapist the night

376
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,820
before his appointment.

377
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,020
Then he sits in the waiting area of his therapist's office.

378
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,380
Then the appointment starts and he gives his therapist five to ten minutes to read

379
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,380
the sit rep.

380
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,980
Then, now that the therapist has all the necessary contacts, they can dive right into the retro

381
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,460
and sprint planning.

382
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,140
It's perfect, efficient meeting.

383
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,660
You send the agenda ahead of time and then you go over the...

384
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,780
Time management, I think it's really smart.

385
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,260
I don't know why more people don't do this.

386
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:44,460
OK, so let's recap what we learned about mental illness.

387
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,500
So depression affects many people.

388
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
It sucks.

389
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,780
It's different for everyone.

390
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,060
Anxiety sucks and is different for everyone.

391
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,580
We learned about cognitive distortions and how to battle them with a thought record.

392
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,700
We talked about cognitive behavioral therapy and finding a therapist.

393
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,540
We talked about dialectical behavioral therapy and some DBT skills that you could learn and

394
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,300
practice with a DBT therapist.

395
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:13,980
And I poorly compared therapy to Agile sprints.

396
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,880
This next part is how you can help and advocate for those with mental illness.

397
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,420
The first thing that I think lays a solid foundation is the book that opensourcing mental

398
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,940
illness created, titled mental health and tech guidelines for employees.

399
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:33,460
The book goes over the ADA, the Americans with disabilities act and the workplace accommodations

400
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,580
that are covered by the ADA.

401
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:41,260
It is a really great resource that walks through should, when and how you ask for accommodations

402
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,260
for disability.

403
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,420
There's a section in the book for types of reasonable accommodations, categorized by

404
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,260
I'm just going to list these off quickly so you kind of have a sense of what to expect.

405
00:22:51,260 --> 00:23:00,100
Concentration, memory, organization, time management, stress or emotions, panic attacks,

406
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:08,540
sleep disturbances, fatigue, attendance, coworker interaction, and working effectively.

407
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:13,300
Some of the accommodations are straightforward and your team may already be doing them.

408
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,500
Allow for open communication.

409
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,100
Don't we all want this?

410
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,300
Why is this a reasonable accommodation?

411
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,300
I don't know.

412
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,820
But allow for open communication.

413
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,100
Provide positive praise and reinforcement.

414
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,740
Develop strategies to deal with conflict.

415
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,780
Plan for uninterrupted work time.

416
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,260
That's just good project management.

417
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,140
Work from home.

418
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,260
Allow flexible schedule.

419
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,580
Divide large assignments into smaller tasks and goals.

420
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,940
That's just good engineering.

421
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,620
Schedule consistent meetings with your report to set goals and review progress.

422
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:54,060
And you can refer to counseling and or employee assistance programs, EAPs.

423
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,420
There are many more accommodations outlined in the book.

424
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,940
You can go to osmheelp.org.

425
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:06,380
You can get the PDF for free or with a donation.

426
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:11,860
On a micro level, here are some things I recommend because I know they work for me.

427
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,380
Tell people they matter if they do.

428
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:19,980
This can be as simple as saying, hi, I care about you.

429
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,100
Or you can grab coffee for someone.

430
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,660
My skip level, every time he goes to get coffee, he asks the whole office, does anyone want

431
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,660
anything?

432
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,540
It's so nice.

433
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,140
You can give someone praise.

434
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,540
Hey, that meeting was awesome.

435
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,740
Thank you for starting it on time.

436
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,700
Thank you for running a swift agenda.

437
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,740
Thank you for wrapping up on time.

438
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,740
You can ask them how they're doing and actively listen to the answer.

439
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,700
You know, have you ever walked down the stairs and someone is just like, hi, how are you?

440
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,700
And you say, hi, how are you?

441
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,100
And then you both walk away and none of you answer.

442
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,740
That is not active listening.

443
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,860
Be respectful of what you say or how you portray mental illness.

444
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:08,180
I encourage you to reconsider using the word crazy because of the stigma associated with

445
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,500
it.

446
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,620
What do you really mean when you say crazy?

447
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:19,340
Are you sure you can't say ridiculous or nonsensical instead?

448
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,500
Please try not to contribute to the stigma.

449
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,660
For example, people who are depressed are not lazy.

450
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,620
The best way to reduce stigma is for people with mental illness to talk about their experience.

451
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,460
People should talk about it.

452
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:39,860
At a macro level, encourage conversations about mental health at all levels of your

453
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,020
company or organization.

454
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,340
You can start small on your team.

455
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:49,460
If you're a senior engineer, take a mental health day and set that example that people

456
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,060
can do that.

457
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,220
A year ago when I gave this talk, someone in HR asked me how one could facilitate these

458
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,900
conversations.

459
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,180
I suggested creating a mental health Slack channel and seeding the channel with articles

460
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,260
or blog posts that spurn conversation.

461
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:13,860
If you're in a leadership position, you can totally participate and kick off these conversations.

462
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,020
Another thing you can do, and this is probably the hardest one, is create a psychologically

463
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,860
safe space.

464
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,300
So what is psychological safety?

465
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,540
It's a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking.

466
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:31,860
In other words, it's being able to show and employ oneself without fear of negative consequences

467
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,100
of self-image, status, or career.

468
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:40,900
If a space is psychologically safe, then people feel accepted and respected.

469
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:45,060
Teams that are not psychologically safe have the following characteristics.

470
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,500
People feel unsafe to innovate, they feel unsafe to resolve conflict, they feel unsafe

471
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,380
to admit they need help.

472
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:57,860
has a great blog post about psychological safety.

473
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,980
This wraps up the advocacy portion of my talk.

474
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,220
Before I leave, I want to give some shout outs to various nonprofits that have aided

475
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,460
in my mental health journey that might be able to help you.

476
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,060
The first is the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, abbreviated to DBSA.

477
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,420
Disclaimer, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

478
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:21,020
I've spoken a bunch about bipolar disorder last year.

479
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,980
That's something that I deal with.

480
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,140
This nonprofit offers support groups for those with depression and bipolar disorder.

481
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,740
The support group helped me better understand what I was experiencing because I learned

482
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,100
a shared language for explaining my symptoms.

483
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,460
Others in the group set my expectations and warned me about medication.

484
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,540
They helped me understand when I should be reaching out to a therapist or a psychiatrist

485
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,180
about my mental health.

486
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:46,580
I recommend this support group if you have depression or bipolar disorder or a mood disorder

487
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:52,540
and would like to meet others with depression or bipolar disorder or mood disorders in general.

488
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:58,460
The DBSA website has a find a support group feature where you can search by zip code.

489
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,420
Another nonprofit that I'd like to highlight is NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

490
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,380
They have many resources on their website for learning about mental illness.

491
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,060
You might have noticed some of the statistics in my talk came from NAMI's site.

492
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,580
They're always looking for volunteers and they have a great email newsletter.

493
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:18,460
And lastly, the nonprofit Open Sourcing Mental Illness is really the reason I'm here speaking today.

494
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,820
AUSME's goal is to change the way we talk about mental health in the tech industry.

495
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,380
We conduct a survey annually about the state of mental health and we actually anonymize

496
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,100
and publish our data set on Kaggle if you're interested.

497
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,980
I would love to see someone post a medium blog post where they analyze our data set.

498
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,460
That'd be super cool.

499
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,260
AUSME runs an online forum where people can discuss mental health.

500
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,940
It used to be called DevPressed.

501
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,860
And as you know, AUSME sends speakers to tech conferences where we can all have conversations

502
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,860
about mental illness.

503
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:55,260
If you want to see more mental health talks, I would recommend watching Ed Finkler's talk

504
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,460
Stronger Than Fear.

505
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,460
It's excellent.

506
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,900
I would watch the version that he gave at Google.

507
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,260
That's a great recording.

508
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,660
Yeah.

509
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,100
I feel extremely lucky to have been invited here today.

510
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,060
If I convince at least one of you to bring up mental health in your workplace, that's

511
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,060
a mission accomplished.

512
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,340
Thank you so much for coming and listening to me talk about a topic near and dear to

513
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,340
my heart.

514
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,780
If you have any questions, feel free to pull me aside afterwards.

515
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,460
I will be doing a Q&A for about 10 minutes.

516
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,940
Better yet, come visit me at the AUSME booth.

517
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,940
That would be fun.

518
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,940
Thank you.
