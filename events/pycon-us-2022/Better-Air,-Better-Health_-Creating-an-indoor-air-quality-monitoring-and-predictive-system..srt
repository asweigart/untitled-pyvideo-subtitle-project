00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,960
Welcome back. I welcome you all to the last talk of the day. We have Maria Jose to deliver

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,840
a talk on better air, better health, creating an indoor air quality monitoring and predictive

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,840
system. Over to you, Maria.

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,760
Thank you so much. Hello, everyone. I'm so excited to be here today talking about how

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,760
to create an air quality monitoring and predictive system. Before I start, I would like to ask

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:43,360
you how many of you are interested in sensor data and microcontrollers? Good. And what

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:52,360
about data analysis? Oh, good. And what about machine learning and data science in general?

8
00:00:52,360 --> 00:01:00,360
Awesome. This is the talk for you. Let's start then. My name is Maria Jose. As you know already,

9
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:07,360
I have a background in plant molecular biology. And currently I am working as a data scientist

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:15,360
at InPharm, that is a vertical farming company. But in my free time, I enjoy doing do-it-yourself

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,360
projects with microcontrollers and IoT and kind of mixing all the things that I love.

12
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:30,360
And this is one of those projects. What is the motivation of this project? Well, with

13
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:38,360
the pandemic situation, my lifestyle changed. Before the pandemic, I was working on site

14
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:48,360
and I was having some more active life. Then I moved to remote life and some changes happened.

15
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:58,360
Some of them, it was like more be at home. I was mainly at home almost the whole day.

16
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:05,360
And someday I start to feel like a lot of headaches, some feeling of being really sleepy,

17
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,360
and I didn't know why until one day I was thinking to say, what is going on in here?

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:20,360
And I realized that when I was going outside, taking fresh air, I was feeling better. And I thought,

19
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:28,360
wait a second, maybe it's something in my air, in my apartment that is not going really well.

20
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:39,360
And then I start doing some research about to know what, how can you quantify your air quality at home?

21
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:47,360
And I realized that there are a lot of factors. For instance, the occupants and how many people

22
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,360
is living in your apartment. Also, there are the humidity and moisture. By the way, I think that it's really

23
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,360
important that you take care of what is the moisture at your apartment. This is also biologists

24
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,360
because the mold and the fungus are really happy once you have moisture and high humidity.

25
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,360
But this is another topic for another day. Then we have also the ventilation, something that you think,

26
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:22,360
wow, I open the windows and that's all, right? Well, it's a bit more complex and you're going to see later why.

27
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Later we have the pollutant sources. For instance, it's not the same if you live in a city with a lot of

28
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:38,360
factories or if you live in countryside, for instance. That is not the same if you live close to a volcano,

29
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:49,360
for instance, in Canada, Iceland or in a desert. Also, we have odors and gases. That is quite important.

30
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:59,360
I start thinking, wow, what is my problem? I don't know yet, right? I start reading publications.

31
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:07,360
As I mentioned, I am a scientist and I love to read scientific publications.

32
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,360
I realized that there was a field that a lot of scientists are publishing about CO2.

33
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:28,360
All of them, for sure, this is just some collection, but there are so many publications about CO2 and the effect in our health.

34
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:42,360
All of them end up saying that it's difficult to correlate the CO2 levels with the health problems because it's more complex.

35
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:51,360
As I mentioned before, there are the humidity, the pollutants, the previous health conditions that you can have,

36
00:04:51,360 --> 00:05:01,360
but all of them indicate that CO2 has an important factor in our health.

37
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:10,360
As you can see, for instance, in the first one, say that CO2 could have an impacting decision-making performance.

38
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Good advice. If you need to make a decision, open your window sometime before making this decision because this could affect you.

39
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Well, what is good, what is bad depends on the definition, always. Be careful because it depends on the source, the numbers change.

40
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:44,360
Let's take it as approximate values. What we have in here is the CO2 per million numbers in the x-axis,

41
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:52,360
and then we have the difference steps when we consider that this situation is good or kind of bad.

42
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:05,360
As you can see, lower to 1,000, we are kind of considered good, and higher to 1,000, we'll be bad, just to summarize the information.

43
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Also, the difference health impacts that we can find here, you need to have in consideration that it's around 2,000,

44
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:26,360
but depends on our other factors and our previous health condition could happen before this 2,000.

45
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Well, at that point, say, hey, I need to do something and test that if my indoor conditions are okay or not.

46
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:49,360
For that, what I did is say, I'm going to take sensors, I'm going to collect data, and I'm going to monitor these values to see what is going on in my apartment.

47
00:06:49,360 --> 00:07:06,360
But then I thought, wait, what if I also could do some prediction because it's really nice to have the values in real life, but what if I could prevent this situation?

48
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,360
And then appeared the idea of having the predictive system.

49
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Let's start step by step because you are going to see that this is a bit complex.

50
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Well, let's start with the data collection.

51
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,360
Well, I used two different sensors.

52
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,360
One is for particles, the blue one, that is the PMSA blah, blah, blah.

53
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,360
And then we have the CD that is for the CO2.

54
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:51,360
I wanted to have as much data as possible because, as I mentioned before, those factors are always working together.

55
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,360
My favorite approach, I try to keep it simple.

56
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:03,360
It's like I try to do something simple, but then everything gets complex.

57
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
You're going to see, you're going to see, but I try.

58
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
I try to keep it simple, I promise.

59
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:25,360
And then what I did is to connect this particle sensor to a QGPi microcontroller, which is really, really small, it's a really compact system, and was really kind of straightforward to have it.

60
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,360
I was running it using Sirq with Python.

61
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:39,360
Everything was really OK until the moment that I decided that I want to collect all this data and I wanted to do the transmission of this data.

62
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,360
This microcontroller has no Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, and then I could not collect the data.

63
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,360
And then I thought, well, let's try another approach.

64
00:08:52,360 --> 00:09:02,360
You can think, OK, you could change the microcontroller and choose another one with Wi-Fi or wireless.

65
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Yeah, it's true.

66
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:13,360
The thing is that I was trying to recycle the microcontrollers that I had at home to minimize kind of everything.

67
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
Because therefore, yes.

68
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,360
But just to be honest, what happened?

69
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:30,360
My second idea for the CO2 was to use MicroPython with ASP32.

70
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,360
This microcontroller has Wi-Fi.

71
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Everything was working really well.

72
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:47,360
Until I tried to connect the other sensor, the particle one, I had some issues with the connection, and I could not solve those issues.

73
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,360
And it was kind of a bottleneck to me.

74
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,360
And for that reason, I just decided to continue with another approach.

75
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:05,360
But you're going to see that this is one of the work in progress that I have right now.

76
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
Well, what's next?

77
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Then I went directly to Raspberry Pi with wireless.

78
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,360
And that will be the setup for data collection.

79
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,360
Of course, I wanted to have something else.

80
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:29,360
I wanted to have a device with a screen where I could check my information.

81
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
Because it's really nice.

82
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Imagine you are in your meetings and you can see if you need to open your window or not or how it's going on.

83
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:47,360
And also it's the perfect excuse to say, hey, we need to finish the meeting because my values of CO2 are getting high.

84
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:54,360
Well, I'm not sure if we'll work, but maybe it's a perfect excuse.

85
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Raspberry Pi 4, in this case, also it was because I had it at home.

86
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,360
You can probably use another one, and it's not a problem at all.

87
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,360
And just added the screen that also is touchable.

88
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
It's really nice.

89
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
You're going to see later.

90
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,360
Then this is the project structure that we are getting.

91
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,360
The two sensors are getting information.

92
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,360
The storage information is the Raspberry Pi.

93
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:33,360
And then I have the two Raspberry Pis connected for a TCP socket, a socket connection.

94
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,360
And then we can start taking a look to the data.

95
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,360
And of course, this is just an example of some of the data that I got.

96
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,360
On the X axis, we have the date.

97
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,360
And the Y axis, we have different parameters, right?

98
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:59,360
The Celsius, the temperatures in Celsius, the humidity, and the CO2.

99
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,360
This is just to show you that there are some fluctuations there.

100
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,360
And this is not going to be easy.

101
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,360
This is not going to be an easy project, I can tell you.

102
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,360
And here are my values of CO2.

103
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:22,360
In green, it's kind of the good values, that it's lower than 1000.

104
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Then in orange, I have these values that it could be better.

105
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:35,360
And in purple are values that are not okay, especially the ones that are in the arrow.

106
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,360
And the bottom, close to 2000.

107
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
This is not a good condition.

108
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,360
And of course, I cannot correlate it with my head age because I cannot do it.

109
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,360
But this is an indicative that the air quality of my apartment was not okay.

110
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:02,360
It would give me a lot of happiness to see that this project makes a lot of sense to develop.

111
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Then we have the monitoring system by one side, that we are going to see the results later.

112
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,360
And on the other hand, we have the predictive.

113
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:22,360
For the predictive one, what I did is implement a time series.

114
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:31,360
If you are not familiar with the concept of time series, basically in here we have a plot not related with the CO2, by the way.

115
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,360
On the x-axis, we have the time, and the y-axis, we have values.

116
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:43,360
This means that we are going to get values in time, and the time is important.

117
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,360
The order is going to be really, really important.

118
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:58,360
And here we have a quite overwhelming plot of my data.

119
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,360
Please take it to time. It's okay.

120
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
It's just that, wow.

121
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,360
In the x-axis, we have the index.

122
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
The index is the time.

123
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,360
In time series, usually what we do is to take the time as an index.

124
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,360
It's like first day, second day, third day.

125
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,360
What we are going to do is one, two, three, and then we take it as an index.

126
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,360
In the y-axis, we have the CO2.

127
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,360
And what we have here is a different oscillation of time of my values of CO2.

128
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:41,360
In the arrows, I am indicating some spaces where the values were quite low.

129
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Do you have an idea what happened in those moments?

130
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,360
Open the window. No.

131
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,360
Something else? We can... windows.

132
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,360
No. No. No.

133
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,360
Well, I'm going to tell you. I was out at home.

134
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
I was on holidays.

135
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:13,360
And then once you're on holidays, you can see that all changed.

136
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,360
But it's really cool to see.

137
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:26,360
Because what is important is where I was tracking also the CO2 was in the place where I work,

138
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,360
in the office place, let's say that way.

139
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,360
And then if I was not in the office, where was not problem.

140
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,360
In the square, I am indicating a really high number of CO2.

141
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,360
Do you have an idea what is going on here?

142
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,360
Sorry?

143
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,360
How about reading?

144
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Is this a day or is this like many days?

145
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Many days.

146
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:03,360
If I had some visits at home, then if you have visits at home, be careful and open more frequently your windows.

147
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,360
That is important lesson that I learned.

148
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,360
If you open once per day when you have visits, try to double or triple the times.

149
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,360
And also really the last interesting thing is the trend.

150
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Is this orange line that we have here, that we have in here, because at some point it starts to decrease.

151
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,360
Any idea what happened?

152
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,360
Yes.

153
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
There was two things.

154
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
One is the change of season.

155
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,360
And as I live in Germany, where the winter is really cold,

156
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,360
and then you try to decrease to open the window because it's really, really cold.

157
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,360
And this is a problem, as you can see.

158
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,360
But when the spring starts, it's different.

159
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:07,360
The weather is like, yeah, yeah, let's open the window and everything will be fine.

160
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,360
And one thing was that.

161
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,360
And a second thing is that I realize, I start analyzing the data of the CO2,

162
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,360
and I realized that I was having an issue at home.

163
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,360
And I start to change it the way that I was opening the windows.

164
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:30,360
Because at the beginning, I was only opening one window and then the second, the third one, let's say.

165
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,360
It's a combination.

166
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:38,360
And I realized that when I was playing with the different windows opening,

167
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,360
the values were changing dramatically.

168
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:49,360
This means that the whole fluids are going in my apartment were affected.

169
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Then this is really interesting to know and also something interesting to play with, in case you're interested.

170
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,360
Then it was OK.

171
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,360
Let's implement some machine learning to try to predict my CO2 levels.

172
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,360
There are so many approaches that you can use to do it.

173
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:18,360
In my case, I decided I saw this publication, which has a really interesting approach

174
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,360
because it has an adaptive approach to predict the indoor CO2.

175
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:32,360
And then also they have this table with the different conditions, different parameters, and different architecture.

176
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:38,360
And I kind of realized that there was like, wow, I can implement a lot of different architecture.

177
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Yes, I buy it.

178
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Of course, I did some variations in my project, but at the end, what I tried to follow is the adaptive idea of windows, of that.

179
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,360
I am doing so much spoilers for the next one.

180
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Then I created the data set.

181
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,360
Well, I monitored before creating the data set.

182
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,360
I monitored different variables.

183
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:14,360
That was the CO2, the humidity, the temperature, the particles, and also the activity level.

184
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:21,360
Because, of course, as you realize, if you are not at home, then you decrease the levels of CO2.

185
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,360
And then if you include that in your model, the prediction will not be really accurate,

186
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:34,360
because if you are not at home, you don't produce CO2 and then that.

187
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,360
Yeah, these kind of things.

188
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:44,360
Then I create the data set, having in consideration of the whole time series work.

189
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
Always be careful with that.

190
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Also needs to be normalized the data for the training and implement this idea of windows, the mobile windows.

191
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,360
In this case, I'm not sure if you're familiar with these kind of methodologies,

192
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:15,360
but what we have is a time, a period of time that we train our model and then we do the prediction for the next hour, days, depends what you need.

193
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Then what you want is move this window to the prediction and update that.

194
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,360
We move, we update, we retrain, we retrain, we retrain, we retrain.

195
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:39,360
What we are going to have with that is more accurate results, because we are having more updated results.

196
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:48,360
Because if you have seasonality of if you are not at home or if you have whatever reasons you have, your data set will be affected.

197
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:58,360
And then at least if you have the most recent situation, you are going to get more accurate results.

198
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,360
Then I use CNN.

199
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,360
I'm not going to go into the details because if not, we are not going to be able to end the talk.

200
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:20,360
But if you have any questions later, I will be happy or at some moment just to show you how this, what is the architecture of the CNN looks like.

201
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:30,360
What I like also to share and I like to see when I go to data science talks is this whole people do this hyperparameter selections.

202
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:38,360
For that reason, I also include it, but I'm going to keep it also fast and simple in case that you are not really interested.

203
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,360
But I love it. For that reason, I decided to include it.

204
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,360
I just mentioned a couple of things.

205
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:55,360
It's like we have a convolution 1D that in this place we are analyzing what is doing is analyzing and structure the pictures.

206
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:05,360
Then we have the input shape that we are going to introduce the variables and the times and the time there in the MaxPool 1D.

207
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:15,360
What is happening is that we're taking the most important information and then we are going to have our output.

208
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,360
Of course, there are much more code.

209
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,360
This is just a part.

210
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
Just to let you know.

211
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:30,360
Well, about metrics and results, I use the RMS as our metric of performance.

212
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:38,360
I did some experiments for hyperparameters, tried to see how it was working.

213
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:44,360
But as you know, as other data science projects, you need to iterate one on one.

214
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,360
I didn't invest so much.

215
00:22:46,360 --> 00:23:01,360
I just did some analysis and approaches because what we are going to need to do once this project is done is go back and improve and optimize all the process.

216
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Then from the windowing perspective, it's really nice.

217
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
I love it.

218
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:17,360
You need to be aware that each window is going to have their own performance.

219
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:25,360
Because if you have a lack of data in some window or something happens, a lot of things could happen.

220
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:35,360
Here I show you some results that I just considered that could be really interesting to see and how it's going.

221
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,360
In blue, we have the input.

222
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
In green, we have the labels.

223
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,360
In orange, this crosses the prediction.

224
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,360
What I'm having here is a window of 24 hours.

225
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,360
What I'm doing is a prediction each hour.

226
00:23:53,360 --> 00:24:01,360
Of course, in the final version, what we are going to see, we are not going to have this exactly.

227
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,360
What we are going to have is the prediction at the end.

228
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,360
I just wanted to share with you how it's going in each step.

229
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,360
As you can see, in some points it's quite accurate.

230
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:22,360
What we expect is half overlapping between the labels and the prediction, the green and the orange.

231
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,360
In some cases, at some moment, it's not happening.

232
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,360
But it's kind of normal and it's something that needs to be optimized.

233
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,360
But it's not bad at all.

234
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,360
Then this is the final project structure that we got.

235
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:47,360
Because we are going to have the machine learning predictions deployed in our Raspberry Pi.

236
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:55,360
And then we are going to have a simple Flask application in the other Raspberry Pi.

237
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,360
And we are going to have to display how everything looks together.

238
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:09,360
First, I thought, okay, I need to install all my sensors and Raspberry Pi in my apartment.

239
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,360
Let's do it nice.

240
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,360
And I removed a picture of my sister.

241
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,360
Don't tell her, please don't tell her.

242
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,360
And I substitute her for some sensors.

243
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Yeah.

244
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,360
Well, this is how it looks like, the Flask application in our Raspberry Pi.

245
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:39,360
It is the one that we are going to have close to our seat or where you work.

246
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:47,360
And what you can see is in here is the temperature, the humidity.

247
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,360
This is the CO2 concentration.

248
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:57,360
In here we have the prediction and just the date.

249
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,360
The idea is to have the raw values from the sensors in constant, in real time.

250
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,360
Of course, not each second.

251
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,360
I think that I program every 10 minutes, if I am not wrong, right?

252
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,360
And then the prediction each hour.

253
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
Why one hour?

254
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:22,360
I decided one hour because it's kind of a time enough to when I end a meeting

255
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,360
and I can kind of take a break.

256
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,360
And it's time enough to me to open the window and do something.

257
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,360
For the other values are really interesting to have more frequently.

258
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,360
But of course, this depends on the criteria and the things that you need.

259
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,360
And this is how it looks like.

260
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,360
You can change your Raspberry Pi and that.

261
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
What is working for us right now?

262
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,360
I am doing this implementation but using microcontrollers,

263
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,360
taking out at least one of the Raspberry Pi.

264
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,360
My idea is to implement and use TensorFlow Lite.

265
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Kind of for fun, let's be honest.

266
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,360
I am going to just do a bit of research.

267
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:19,360
And something that I didn't mention is that I didn't include the particles information in my model.

268
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,360
And maybe someone is wondering, wait, but you changed the system from the microcontrollers

269
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,360
to the Raspberry Pi for that, right?

270
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,360
Yes, I did.

271
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:38,360
The problem was that the sensor arrived late because I bought it a bit late.

272
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:45,360
And I could not have all the data that I wanted.

273
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,360
And I had the system running with the CO2 and the humidity and temperature.

274
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,360
And I did this decision and say, OK, I'm going to take out the particles.

275
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:04,360
And that's what the next iteration will be in because it will bring a lot of interesting information.

276
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,360
And then, of course, optimization.

277
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,360
This project as a data science project needs optimization.

278
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,360
But also from microcontrollers, it could be optimized.

279
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,360
And yeah, all the projects could be.

280
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,360
That's going to end my presentation here.

281
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:34,360
If you want to be in touch or if you have questions, just feel free to reach me out.

282
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,360
I will be really happy to discuss because I love all those topics.

283
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,360
As you can see, I enjoy it a lot.

284
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,360
And thank you so much for your attention.
