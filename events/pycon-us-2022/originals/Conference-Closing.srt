1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,200
Well, we have neared the end of PyCon US 2022, but we still have a few things left for you,

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,040
so just a couple of housekeeping items.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,200
Our final PyCon US event is our sprints.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,640
They will be held in rooms 250 and 251 and are free to attend to anyone with a PyCon

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,640
US registration.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,560
Please note that these are still official PyCon US events and that our health and safety

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,080
guidelines do still apply.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,000
We'll provide coffee and lunch during these events.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,200
For more information, check out PyCon.us.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,120
And stick around right after this where we will have our sprint rows.

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,040
We'll have quick introductions for all of the projects that will be participating.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,600
No need to sign up.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,640
Just after we close out this event right now, we'll bring the half slides up, let people

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,000
disperse who don't care to attend or aren't able to stick around.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,600
So at that point, if you're interested in presenting a project, just come line up right

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,760
next to the stage and five, ten minutes after that we'll start our sprint rows.

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,760
Also there are receptacles all around the convention center.

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,240
There's definitely one by the Salt Shaker where everyone has been entering, but there

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,080
are a few others scattered about.

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,840
So if you don't want to keep your lanyard as a memento from the conference, you can

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:29,160
drop off your lanyard and it will be upcycled into art by a local artist collective.

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,040
All right.

23
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,920
So last night we had the PyLadies auction.

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,880
Eventually we're going to have to drop some of these years off the slide because they

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,560
just aren't all going to fit.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,480
But this growth is just phenomenal.

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,480
And so last night we were able to raise $40,000 for PyLadies.

28
00:01:48,480 --> 00:02:03,480
But wait, that number actually isn't quite right.

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,240
Once we totaled up all of the donations that we've collected, auction bids, auction entry

30
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,280
tickets, PyLadies keychain and t-shirt sales and all additional donations and donation

31
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:28,800
Our grand total was $53,267.

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,960
Huge shout out to our accounting department, especially to Phyllis and Joe, who crunched

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,720
these numbers for me so that I could present them.

34
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,200
And they also ran all of the payments and processing throughout the event.

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Another piece of really impressive data, the numbers of attendees that we had this year

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,680
in person.

37
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,560
We knew that this year was going to be sort of a slow ramp up to get back to our previous

38
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,680
in person attendance numbers.

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,680
So this year we had 655 active online attendees, so people who actually logged into the system,

40
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:09,200
and 747 in person attendees who picked up a badge.

41
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Of those attendees, 389 of our online participants were first time attendees, and 1,149 in person

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:25,600
attendees were first timers.

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,080
So for those of you who haven't already done the math on that, that means that 64% of our

44
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,600
attendees were first timers at PyCon US this year.

45
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Personally I like to interpret this as a testament to our community, how enthusiastic people were

46
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,920
to get to a PyCon who had never been, and also how strong our sense of community is

47
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,720
that we could have a PyCon just like every other PyCon, with so many new people here

48
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,080
that we could welcome them into our community and still have an event like any other.

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,080
And so as quickly as it started, our time together is coming to a close.

50
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:15,080
Whew, it gets ya, and you don't expect it.

51
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:30,080
Okay, so one of the things I tried when I was rehearsing this, to avoid this, was to

52
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,520
talk in a British accent, so we're going to give that a try for a couple of lines.

53
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,960
So if there's anything more clear to me than five days ago, it's how persistent and durable

54
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,320
our community is, how it spans the globe effortlessly and brings us together, supporting

55
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,320
each other through space and time.

56
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:58,320
So I saw a tweet towards the beginning of the conference that I unfortunately couldn't

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
track down who exactly it was from, but it was from a person who I assume was a first

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
time attendee, and they essentially said that within the first few hours of them being at

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,400
their first PyCon, that they felt solidified and confident in the direction that they were

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,200
taking their life and career by pursuing programming and by being at this conference.

61
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,800
We have so much more impact than we sometimes realize, and I, for one, feel fueled up and

62
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,960
re-energized after a mere five days with you all.

63
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,900
We sometimes forget living in our own bubbles, working from our homes, or interacting over

64
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:41,160
ones and zeros, the breadth and depth of the Python language and its applications.

65
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,560
And yet, as Peter pointed out in his keynote, there's still so much more reach that we can

66
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,680
have, and that is staggering because we've done so much already.

67
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,840
So I thank you all for carrying this forward and for continuing to contribute and grow

68
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,440
our community, and I thank you all endlessly for letting me be your steward for the last

69
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,560
three years.

70
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,240
One of my favorite authors has said, nothing of me is original.

71
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,720
I am the combined effort of everyone I've ever known.

72
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,400
Thank you for taking a chance on Python and constantly giving to others more than you

73
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
take yourselves.

74
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,480
I know that PyCon would not be the same without each and every one of you bringing your unique

75
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,800
perspectives to share with each of us.

76
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:36,800
And now, in my final act, I'd like to introduce you to your incoming chair for 2023 to 2024,

77
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
Marietta.

78
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
Thank you.

79
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
Thank you, Emily.

80
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Hi.

81
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,880
Hi.

82
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Okay.

83
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
All right.

84
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
Hi, everybody.

85
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
My name is Marietta.

86
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
I have slides to show you.

87
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,880
I'm going to show you a slide that I made up of a couple of years ago.

88
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Do they show up?

89
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,880
Okay.

90
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
Ta-da.

91
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Yeah.

92
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,880
I'm really sorry that I got to be the one who said goodbye.

93
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,880
Also, I'm Canadian.

94
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,880
But I know we are all feeling emotional right now.

95
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,880
It's been a great almost a whole week for me, and I know you all feel the same.

96
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:41,960
I'm not sad because I know I will see all of you back here again next year, right?

97
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
Right?

98
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,960
And for those of you who join us virtually online, I really hope you could join us next

99
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
year, right here.

100
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:58,960
If that's not possible, we will still be offering the virtual streaming option.

101
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:06,040
I also saw on Twitter that people attended only on Twitter.

102
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,040
They attended PyCon US on Twitter because of the result of folks live tweeting using

103
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,040
the hashtag PyCon US 2022, and that's really awesome.

104
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,040
I really hope they all will join us in person next year.

105
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:28,040
And I would like to ask all of you, tell your friends, tell your coworkers about PyCon.

106
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,120
Tell them about how amazing, what a great time you have here.

107
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,120
Tell them about all the things you've learned, all the people you've met, so that they can

108
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,120
experience this themselves next year.

109
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:53,120
Now, PyCon US is just one.

110
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,200
One of many Python conferences all around the world.

111
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:07,200
In fact, if you go to PyCon.org, you can see a list of all Python conferences all around

112
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
the world, not just in the US.

113
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:16,200
In fact, I've collected a list of upcoming regional Python conferences all around the

114
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,200
world between now and the next PyCon US.

115
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,280
In fact, there's like almost more than one each month.

116
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,280
If you live near these areas, go there.

117
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:34,280
If you don't live near these areas, it's a good opportunity to travel there.

118
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:43,280
So, again, there's more PyCons in September, all the way until next year.

119
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:52,360
So, after you attended all of those PyCons, I will see you all back here, right here in

120
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:59,360
April 19, which is less than even a month, a year from now.

121
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:08,360
And after Salt Lake City, after 2023, we will come to Pittsburgh for 2024 and 2025.

122
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:24,360
And now, let us all take a moment to just recognize the work of volunteers who make

123
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,360
this PyCon happen.

124
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:33,360
PyCon is a community run, so I really want to make sure we recognize our volunteers.

125
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:40,360
So, I'm going to start calling out names of groups, and if you hear the name of the group

126
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,440
that you all participate in, please stand up and please remain stand up.

127
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:53,440
And I would like for all of us to look around you so we can acknowledge their contributions

128
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
and applaud them.

129
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
All right.

130
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,440
It's a long list.

131
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
I'm ready, okay?

132
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,440
So, first of all, thank you PyCon staff.

133
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,440

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,680
Session Chairs.

171
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,680
If you run items at the auction.

172
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,680
If you run the registration information desk.

173
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,680
If you greet the tutorial attendees.

174
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,680
If you wore the Ask Me button.

175
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,760
And all of you, thank you for being here.

176
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,760
All of you, thank you.

177
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,760
Thank you.

178
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Alright, thank you so much.

179
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:28,760
And I will see you all back here next year in Salt Lake City 2023.

180
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Thank you.

181
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Thank you.

182
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
Hello?

183
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
Yes.

184
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Don't leave yet.

185
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
Don't leave yet.

186
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,840
If you're sprinting tomorrow, sprint rows are happening right now.

187
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,840
If you're a maintainer, please come out, line up over here to introduce your projects.

188
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,840
So the maintainers are about to introduce what they're working on.

189
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,840
So contributors can hear what they'll have a chance to work on tomorrow.

190
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Every project gets one minute max.

191
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840
It's like extreme lightning talks.

192
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
So it's going to go quick.

193
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,840
Just pay attention.

194
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Maintainers, maybe mention your project.

195
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,920
When you're starting, what people can work on and what they might need to know first.

196
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,920
If you hear a project that sounds interesting, say hi to them after they step off the stage.

197
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,920
And you can also find sprint boards outside in the hallway where the open space boards were before.

198
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,920
What did they hear and what did they not hear?

199
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Okay, we're good.

200
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Okay, so I'll get out of the way.

201
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I got to go jump in line because I'm a maintainer also.

202
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'll just let the first project come up.

203
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh, you want me to go first?

204
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Okay.

205
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm David Lord.

206
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm a Pallets Flask maintainer and a PSF fellow.

207
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Brett Cannon usually just does this intro, but I think I'm tall enough to replace him.

208
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,080
So I'll be sprinting on all the Pallets projects tomorrow.

209
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:33,080
So that's Flask, Ginger, Clique, Verksoyge, which you too can learn how to almost pronounce.

210
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,080
I've been brainstorming a bunch of issues, big and small, for new and experienced contributors,

211
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,080
including async, customization, automation, and more.

212
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,080
I'll be starting at 8 a.m. and I will have donuts.

213
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,080
So please join me to contribute to Flask and Pallets.

214
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
Thank you.

215
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,080
All right.

216
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,080
No one asked me to do this, but I guess I sort of volunteered.

217
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,080
Some of us are going to be sprinting on CPython, which is the reference interpreter,

218
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,080
or the reference implementation of the Python language.

219
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,080
So if you want to come by, you can.

220
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,080
I don't know if there's like an organized thing, but we'll be doing that.

221
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
So thank you.

222
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
Hey there.

223
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
My name's Christopher Neugebauer.

224
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
I'm working with the Pants Build project.

225
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,160
We will be sprinting on both Pants, the build system, as well as PECS,

226
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,160
which is a project that we maintain.

227
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,160
We will have a collection of first-time suitable tickets

228
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,160
if you want to hack on some of the code behind Pants and PECS.

229
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,160
Also, if you are interested in onboarding your repository, open source,

230
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,160
you can do that by clicking on the link in the description.

231
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,240
We are interested in having more users so we can figure out how to make

232
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,240
everyone's builds run faster, and we need to onboard more repos.

233
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,240
And we have core contributors who are happy to help you do that.

234
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
So come find us tomorrow.

235
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,240
We'll be there sometime probably before 9 o'clock.

236
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,240
So, I'm going to start by saying thank you to the Pants team for the

237
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,320
Shaheen Somas faces with the Pants team.

238
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
Look forward too.

239
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,320
Thanks, everyone, for Maïtia Mori.

240
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,320
Alexia.

241
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Alexia.

242
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,320
Alexia huntings.

243
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,320
Tales of Thrlessness.

244
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,320
They exist.

245
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,120
In these ideas, Dr.

246
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,220
Caudaff, the muscle image engineer who helped Maïtia to build it.

247
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,320
We have ARD Projects.

248
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:41,320
have Seeker Seeker on. Thank you.

249
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,700
Hi. It seems every word counts, so I'm reading this pitch from my phone, including this sentence.

250
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:54,700
I'm Bensa. I work on Semgrap, a tool for searching through code. And if you ever wanted to write

251
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,840
a linter rule, we can probably write it as a Semgrap rule in like five, 10 minutes tomorrow.

252
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,760
And you'll have your very own code checker that you can also share with others. So just

253
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,760
join us tomorrow. Hey, everybody. Nick Reinike with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

254
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,320
We recently refactored some of our map matching code and released it as a Python package.

255
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:29,320
We used the code to support some research that we do in our transportation group. We

256
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,960
used it to support a recent effort with Google Maps to incorporate e-co-routing into their

257
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,520
platform. So we're going to be sprinting on making the package a little bit more robust.

258
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:47,120
It's a baby package right now, version 0.1. So there should be stuff for everybody, docs,

259
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:54,120
new features, testing. So we'd love to see you there.

260
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,400
Hello. My name is Eric Mathis. I'll be working on a project called Django Symbol Deploy.

261
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,040
The goal of the project is to support people who are learning Django deployment. It automates

262
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,760
the initial deployment process. They get to run one management command that if you have

263
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,720
an account on a platform like Heroku or Azure, you don't need to visit their docs to learn

264
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,720
the initial deployment. You run one command and your project appears live on that platform.

265
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,760
The project works. It's new, but it's been had a positive early reception. So if you're

266
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,280
interested in this, I'm happy to show you a quick demo, tell you what I'm working on,

267
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:39,280
and either accept contributions, questions, or comments. Thank you.

268
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,040
Hello. So we're going to sprint on Pyodide, which is a Python distribution for the browser

269
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:55,440
that uses WebAssembly. So the sprint mainly aims to focus essentially to improve different

270
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:02,440
Pyodide components, so to make designing applications for the browser, Python applications for the

271
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,120
browser easier. But of course you can also work on everything that's in the ecosystem.

272
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,080
So for instance, like if you have an application and you want to maybe try to use PyScript

273
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,360
for it, or if you want to play with Jupiter Lite, there's a lot of things that are happening

274
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,760
or maybe contribute to CPython upstream and for the WASM work, that's also possible.

275
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:28,760
We're also just happy to answer questions. Thank you.

276
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:37,040
Hi everyone. My name's Zach. I'm a PSF Fellow and I maintain a testing library called Hypothesis.

277
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,320
It can write tests for you as well as generating test data. And tomorrow and on Tuesday I'll

278
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,600
be sprinting on a whole bunch of cool new features around optimizing that, fixing a

279
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,560
number of smaller bugs, and if you're really keen, diving into the eldritch unreadable

280
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:57,100
internals. I have enough stickers for everybody here, and for those who contribute, I also

281
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,100
have gorgeous little enamel pins. So if you'd like some gorgeous dragonfly merch, come see

282
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:09,100
me, and I look forward to sprinting with you tomorrow.

283
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:16,220
Hi everybody. I'm Eric and I'm with the PyGenitor project. PyGenitor is a project that has a

284
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,340
collection of data cleaning functions that are compatible with Panda's data frames. We'll

285
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:27,060
be sprinting on primarily documentation tomorrow, but if you've also got ideas of common data

286
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,340
cleaning functions that you'd like to contribute, we'd love to hear from you on that too. The

287
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:37,620
library is intentionally designed to be extremely beginner friendly, so if this is your first

288
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,940
time ever making an open source contribution and you'd like to try your hand at making

289
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:48,540
one in a library that's easy to use and easy to contribute to, come check us out. We've

290
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:53,780
got all the set up instructions that are needed to make life really easy for you. And it's

291
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,900
especially, especially suited for people who like myself handle lots of data. So come check

292
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,900
us out. Thank you.

293
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:11,780
Hi everybody. I am Matt Wisniewski. I'm one of the maintainers of MemRay, which is a profiler

294
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:19,100
that tracks memory usage of a Python application. It can track native allocations that are happening

295
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,780
in the C libraries underneath your Python application. It has a live mode that lets

296
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:29,740
you see what's going on as you run it. It's pretty cool. I don't have issues groomed for

297
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,420
beginners, but what would be really helpful to me is if people wanted to stop by and

298
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,660
try it out on their projects and let me know what's wrong with the documentation, let me

299
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:44,940
know what bugs you find, let me know anything that you see that's wrong with it. If you

300
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,540
are interested in contributing, I'm sure I can help you get set up with a build environment

301
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:55,540
and you can start hacking on it too. Thanks.

302
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:02,540
Hello everybody. I'm AJ Kerrigan. I'll be sprinting on Cloud Custodian tomorrow. It's

303
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:10,180
a rules engine for evaluating your cloud resources, AWS, GCP, Azure, and some other bits. So if

304
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:16,180
you have interest in determining if your cloud resources are already compliant with some

305
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,860
internal policies that you have or you want to get used to using the project, explore

306
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,980
some documentation, make any sorts of contributions you're interested in, please come by and say

307
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:31,980
hi to us.

308
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:37,140
Hello everyone. My name is Katniss and I will be sprinting on Circuit Python. Circuit Python

309
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:42,180
is a version of Python that runs on microcontrollers. We have hardware available so if you want

310
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,980
to contribute to the libraries or the core, you will need to know Python for the libraries

311
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:53,380
or C is what the core is written in, just like Python. We will be there for both days.

312
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,660
Myself and Melissa will be hosting. So stop by if you want to learn more about Circuit

313
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:04,660
Python or if you want to contribute, we're happy to facilitate both. Thank you.

314
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:11,660
Hello. My name is Dorota. I'm from the MacGyver Institute for Brain Research at MIT and I'm

315
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:18,220
working on your dataflow engine. This is a called Pydra. This is a very small project

316
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:23,420
right now so I don't have any stickers but I would be happy to show you and have some

317
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:30,420
tutorial with you. If I don't have any beginners, I would just work on adding data, task support

318
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,980
to schedule jobs and probably some async IO, like new implementation. So if you can help

319
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:42,980
me with this, that would be also great. Thank you.

320
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:49,980
Hello. My name is Lauren. I work with Meta and we're working on Cinder so we have a couple

321
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,980
of specific optimizations to see Python and we'll be sprinting on trying to upstream some

322
00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:01,980
of that work. Thank you.

323
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,980
Okay. Thank you everybody. Thanks to all the maintainers. Sounds like there's some great

324
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:12,580
projects. Really exciting to see so many contributors sitting in the audience still. Have a great

325
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:18,780
rest of your night and see you all bright and early tomorrow, right? Right? Thank you

326
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,780
to the PSF and all the organizers. Goodbye.
