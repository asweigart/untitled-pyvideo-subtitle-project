1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,500
I would like to introduce Georgie Kerr, Lorena Mesa, Anthony Shaw, and Reuven Lerner for

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:18,400
our diversity and inclusion work group panel.

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Dangerous chairs.

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,400
Let me try.

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,400
Yeah, good morning everyone.

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,400
Come on.

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
Good morning everyone.

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,400
Yay!

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,400
Wow, Georgie, you're really bringing it.

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,400
I'm just like heating up the seats.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
It's pretty cold here.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,400
Yes, it is freezing in here.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,400
I want to say hi to all those people watching on live too because we've not been saying

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,400
much to them.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,400
But we see you.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,400
So today we are having a panel chat here with a group of us.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,400
So we are going to talk to you a little bit about what PSI, PSF, diversity and inclusion

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,400
work group is about, why we're here today, and how you can help us.

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,400
So let's do a quick self-introduction.

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Hey, I feel like I live on the stage this morning.

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,400
My name is Lorena Mesa, pronoun she-day.

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Oh, and I'm the current chairperson of the Python Software Foundation, do things with

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Pylates, et cetera.

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Hi, I'm Anthony Shaw, a PSF fellow around nuisance.

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,400
I'm Rufin Lerner, I'm a Python trainer.

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,400
I'm Georgie, I'm a woman.

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Okay.

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:08,400
So the diversity and inclusion work group was set up in November 2020.

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,400
And there's a total of 20 members led by Marlin.

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,400
So here's a little map that you can see of the members around the world.

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,400
You might have met a couple of them in person, like Deborah, Christian, who's there too.

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
I don't know.

33
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Deborah should be somewhere around.

34
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,400
So why do we create diversity and inclusion work group in PSF?

35
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:38,400
In 2020, there were four seats available in the PSF Board of Directors and received 26

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:48,400
nominees, nine from North America, four from South America, two from Europe, six from Africa,

37
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
and five from Asia.

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,400
It's part of APAC.

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Yeah.

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,400
So by the end of the election, all four elected parties were from the USA.

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:14,400
We also realized that out of 1,151 members, only 40.1% of us voted.

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,400
Now let's look at the changes and achievements in 2021.

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,400
Now in 2021, we have actually three board seats available and 19 nominees.

44
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:35,400
So you can see that most of the members are mostly, mainly from Asia and South America.

45
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Now this time we have elected parties from South America, one from Africa, and one from Europe.

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Still no elected parties from Asia despite seven nominations.

47
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
We do have more members.

48
00:03:51,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Sign up last year, that was like 1,538 members who were eligible to vote, but only 39% of them vote.

49
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,400
In 2021, we have more languages in our documentation.

50
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Documentation for Python 3.10 were translated into 10 different languages thanks to all our volunteers.

51
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:26,400
With the help of over 200 Pythonistas, the Spanish translation was completed in January 2022.

52
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:40,400
We also see that the Python technical leadership mostly are core developers in North America.

53
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:55,400
If we look at the growth of Python developers worldwide, the developers grew from 8.2 million to 10.1 million in 2021.

54
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,400
That is like 1.9 million within a year.

55
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
That's amazing, Pythonistas.

56
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,400
So let's look at the geographic distribution around the market.

57
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Based on the GitHub repo in 2021, although this data does not filter any languages,

58
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,400
but since Python is one of the main languages around the world, it's pretty accurate,

59
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,400
there is no doubt that Asia is the dominant market.

60
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Now let's discuss a little bit about the slides based on the facts that we have here.

61
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,400
What do you think was the problem during the 2020 election?

62
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,400
I was asked what in the world is the Python Software Foundation.

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
As a director for six years, I have been saying the same thing over and over,

64
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,400
which is we are here to help build an inclusive and diverse community that is as inclusive and diverse as our users.

65
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:00,400
I think one of the things that started some of this conversation that led to the creation of the diversity and inclusion workgroup

66
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,400
was us thinking a little bit about the mandate of the Python Software Foundation.

67
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Again, the Python Software Foundation, we help put this event on.

68
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
We help think about fundraising.

69
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,400
We help thinking about what are the issues around the world that Pythonistas are facing.

70
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,400
We own the trademark, et cetera, et cetera.

71
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:28,400
So considering that the board of directors, unfortunately, has historically had a bias towards people in the United States or North America and Europe,

72
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,400
what I think we're seeing is as we continue to grow and have a more global population of Pythonistas,

73
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:42,400
we're not maybe reaching the plethora of issues that we could otherwise be if we were having directors

74
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,400
or having more inclusion with voting members, et cetera, of Pythonistas around the world.

75
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,400
One of the things I think was really great with the end of the lightning talks is we see this growth of the regional conferences,

76
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,400
but again, we're continuing to kind of have a little bit of a stagnant issue with outreach.

77
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:04,400
And not to say that directors who come from the United States or directors who come from Europe don't understand these issues,

78
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:12,400
but we all know that the people that are in these given communities are best able to speak to things that are the unique challenges in their neck of the woods.

79
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,400
So I think that was one of the main things that led to this discussion.

80
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Again, all of us are volunteers.

81
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,400
We're all very passionate about this community, but literally our mandate says we are building a diverse and inclusive environment

82
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,400
and community that reflects our user population.

83
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
So I think that was like a really big thing that kind of jumped in.

84
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:39,400
And that was something very glaring to us in the election was just seeing that we weren't maybe reaching people in a way that we could otherwise be reaching them.

85
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Right. That's true.

86
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Anthony, what do you think in 2021 we see some changes there?

87
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,400
We do have more members, but what do you think the changes actually cost in 2021?

88
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Yeah, so things have changed quite a lot over the last couple of years.

89
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:03,400
The membership has expanded and there's been a lot more people sign up from Asia in particular.

90
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:11,400
So I guess the membership of the PSF has expanded and also geographically and in other aspects is a lot more diverse.

91
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,400
And in terms of the board nominees, at least, I think there's a lot more diversity in the nominees.

92
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:26,400
I think what we need to look at going forward is how do we make sure that we advertise that more and continue to try and recruit members into the PSF.

93
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Well, we do see also that there's actually more still mainly the core developers from the US.

94
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Does that mean that the experts are actually in the US only?

95
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:51,400
So, I mean, there's definitely a lot of skills in the US and that's kind of obvious.

96
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,400
But it's not exclusive to the US and there are definitely people with talents and skills elsewhere.

97
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:05,400
I think before we look at addressing this and trying to make it more diverse, we need to appreciate a couple of things.

98
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:13,400
One, the healthy discussion and community of core developers is critical to the success of Python.

99
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,400
And we need to protect that.

100
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,400
That doesn't mean that bringing new people in is going to make that worse.

101
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,400
And I think we just need to kind of plan things a bit further ahead.

102
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Also, if you look at the poor requests to see Python, they are diverse.

103
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,400
So there's people from all over the world making their first changes to see Python, submitting poor requests and things like that.

104
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,400
But at the moment, you know, it's still a bit of who you know.

105
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:52,400
And it's easier to get a poor request merged if you know some of the core developers or you're already a part of the community or you're a known person.

106
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,400
So I think if we want to get more core developers from diverse geographically,

107
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:05,400
then we need to look at how can we spot or at least identify people who are trying to contribute and actually bring them in and have a discussion with them.

108
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Because I don't know if anyone else remembers the feeling when they get their PR merged the first time.

109
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:19,400
It's just especially see Python like it's yeah, it's a you know, it's a pretty high bar to get something into see Python.

110
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,400
And there are people doing this every day from all over the world.

111
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,400
So I think we definitely need to look at how we can bring more of them on board.

112
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:39,400
I do. I do feel that living in Asia previously that a lot of people or developers in Asia feel that they're not capable.

113
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:48,400
They're not good enough. Is there a way to actually make them reassure that they can actually contribute and they actually good enough?

114
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Anyone of you can.

115
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:56,400
I think mentoring is a has been demonstrated to be really effective with bringing on core developers.

116
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:08,400
So existing core developers mentoring people and there have definitely been cases of that with new core developers from from Africa and also from Asia and people existing core developers mentoring them.

117
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,400
I think that's been really effective in terms of the resources as well.

118
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
It's really important.

119
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:21,400
So, so what do you think how we can actually reach out to these people?

120
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:33,400
So look, I think a big problem is just sort of the perception of software in general and Python and open source software in particular that for many people, they're like, OK, I have software.

121
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,400
And when they see open source, they don't think oh, community supported and written.

122
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,400
They think free, right? I could download it. I don't need to pay for this thing.

123
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Certainly a lot of companies say that and think that and the notion of oh, there's a problem with this or there's something that could be better.

124
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:54,400
I can change it. I can be part of that improvement that doesn't occur to most people and then take it even a step further.

125
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:01,400
The notion that there's an organization that's charter is to help people improve the language based on their needs.

126
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
That's like the furthest thing from their minds.

127
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,400
So the first thing I think we have to do is do a better job of telling these people the PSF exists, the community exists.

128
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,400
It's not just a word, oh, the Python community, it's all the people use it.

129
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,400
There is an actual community and you can join it and you can be active and you can influence its direction.

130
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:23,400
And once people have that sense of oh, we can influence it, then we can start to talk to them about the different ways to do it.

131
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Code, documentation, translation, teaching, the works.

132
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,400
So one question here to the public. How many of you are PSF members?

133
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Oh, wow.

134
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,400
How many of you actually voted last year?

135
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Very good.

136
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
You people all there?

137
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Can you hear me?

138
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Online.

139
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
So let's see how you can help.

140
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,400
There are four ways you can help.

141
00:12:53,400 --> 00:13:20,400
First, you can actually, if you feel that you would like to share with the discussion, you can provide us with your feedback, scan the local QR code over there, and answer the questionnaire, and tell us what you would like, how you would think that we can actually make a better global representation and help the community to grow.

142
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Or if you are not a PSF member yet, sign up.

143
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Sign up on PSF-org under membership.

144
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,400
And if you are already a PSF member, vote.

145
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:42,400
Another interesting thing that we, people that doesn't know about it is the Community Service Award.

146
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Lorena, can you actually explain?

147
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Sure.

148
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Sure.

149
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,400
And actually, later today with the PSF community update, you'll get to see some of these amazing fine folks.

150
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:57,400
We actually have some CSA recipients here on stage, like Georgie.

151
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:13,400
And something that I think is really important to think about is we're all doing amazing work in our own communities, and it can be that you are contributing to a project, you are running your meetup, you might be doing something really novel and interesting with Python.

152
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:21,400
All that being said, we like to support our community, and you can do that by writing in to the Python Software Foundation.

153
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Just write a small blurb of who or whom, it could be a group, an organization, a few people, telling us why you think these people ought to, or this organization ought to, receive the Community Service Award.

154
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:42,400
We do them quarterly, and we are always looking for more people to lift up, particularly from spaces where maybe we don't have as much insight.

155
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Again, one of the things we're always trying to think about is how do we support one another and how do we acknowledge all of the great work that we do, and a small way you can do that is with the CSA.

156
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Yeah, exactly.

157
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,400
You can also look at the picture that's on the slide.

158
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:04,400
It's also one of the communities as a whole that has received the award from PyCon Japan.

159
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:12,400
They have donated, I think, $25,000, amazing amount of money to the donation.

160
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Apart from that, they have been always active in whatever, all the Python related community service as a whole.

161
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:30,400
If you see anyone in your community around the world anywhere, do sign up.

162
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Tell them, tell us, tell us that they exist and tell us what kind of job they have done, what kind of amazing job they have done, and let us know because we need to know.

163
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Everyone needs to know that there are somewhere, a Pythonista that's doing the work, helping the community that's spreading out the word.

164
00:15:51,400 --> 00:16:03,400
And when you have that kind of assurance that your work has been recognized, that actually makes a difference.

165
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:11,400
I mean, I'm sure every one of you felt it when someone come to you and say, hey, thank you, especially for example, like Anthony.

166
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Do you actually see people coming to you and say, oh, Anthony, I love your contribution?

167
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:26,400
That's actually happened quite a lot this weekend and it's been really weird.

168
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Yeah, it feels amazing and very, very humbling as well.

169
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,400
And I really appreciate it to anyone who has had any positive comments and stuff like that.

170
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:42,400
And also getting to meet people who I really respect and look up to at the conference and share that feedback with them as well.

171
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:53,400
And meet loads of new people and people who want to get involved and they're keen and they're enthusiastic and just trying to keep encouraging that is really important.

172
00:16:53,400 --> 00:17:01,400
So how about you? Do you feel anything during this conference, Reuben, did anyone come to you?

173
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

174
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:14,400
And it's amazing. First of all, I feel what Anthony said, which is meeting people in person who you've interacted with online, whether it's my mailing list or Twitter or elsewhere.

175
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
That is of course great.

176
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,400
And look, there's so many people doing so many things for Python, some big and some small.

177
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:29,400
If you see them, tell them. If you see them here, if you see them online, let them know, encourage them to do this.

178
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,400
It's because people are doing these things big and small that Python exists as a language, as an ecosystem.

179
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:44,400
And I've been in technology for a while now and I continue to be impressed by the generosity and the kindness in the Python community.

180
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,400
And that just is going to encourage more people to join us, more people to come in, more people to contribute, which is good for everyone.

181
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,400
I've heard diversity and inclusion described as this.

182
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,400
Diversity is being invited to the party, inclusion is being asked to dance.

183
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:06,400
I heard that at, I think it was PyCon Columbia in 2018, and I thought that was a really great way of thinking about it.

184
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:14,400
When you hear diversity, inclusion, workgroup, you might be thinking, oh, we have some data figures that we're trying to hit or we have some explicit programming.

185
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,400
But really, the programming comes as a result of what we as a community care about.

186
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,400
I have quoted Brett Cannon more times than I care, which is I came for the language, I stay for the community.

187
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Let me give you one example of the way I think about that.

188
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Marlene, who is one of, who is a director from Zimbabwe, was doing this amazing work educating young women in Zimbabwe.

189
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,400
And I was reading the grant proposal and some of the impact of the work that she had done.

190
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,400
And I was completely fangirling. I believe it was PyCon in Portland in 2016.

191
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,400
I was doing my recruitment looking for directors to contact, and I just started talking to her on Twitter.

192
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,400
I was like, you're amazing, you're amazing. Have you ever thought about running for the board?

193
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,400
You have such a great perspective. You're doing all this really great work.

194
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:06,400
And I think over the span of like spamming her on Twitter over the entire PyCon weekend, I finally got her to sign up.

195
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,400
And now she's doing a phenomenal, not that she wasn't before, but she's continued to be doing phenomenal things.

196
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,400
And she's a community service recipient, has helped start PyCon Africa.

197
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:24,400
The PyCon African communities have been so instrumental, I think, in showing, again, a different perspective that we may not have otherwise seen.

198
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:32,400
I know Kodra, who I see here in the audience, we were at PyCon Africa the inaugural year and just seeing that explosion of growth.

199
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:40,400
And again, it starts with such a small thing, acknowledging the work that other people do and just supporting them can be a step in the direction,

200
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,400
again, to continue to build that inclusive and diverse community that we all as Pythonese do care about.

201
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
So that's my example when I think about it.

202
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:56,400
All right. So if you have any other questions, do reach out to any one of us when we are somewhere hanging out,

203
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,400
or Christian or Deborah or online on this web email.

204
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,400
And do vote. Sign up as a PSF member if you are not.

205
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:16,400
And help to let us know everyone around the world that's contributing to this community.

206
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,400
That's how we can be sustainable. Thank you.
