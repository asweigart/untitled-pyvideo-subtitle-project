1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
All right.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,920
Hi everyone.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,920
Welcome.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,080
Today we're going to be talking about learning Python like a 12-year-old.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,880
And I can see that there might be some 12-year-olds in the audience.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,780
So we're going to help your parents understand how you learn better so that they can help

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,540
you learn faster and easier and all of those great things.

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,080
So we're glad you're here too.

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,760
But first, we really need to take a selfie.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,340
So if you get bored and you start looking at your phone, you can go search us up and

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,300
tag us and like our photos.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,300
So everyone wave.

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,300
Everyone smile.

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,300
Nice.

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,300
All right.

16
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,300
So, Kelly.

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:44,380
So I'm Kelly Schuster-Paredes and I'm a teacher who codes.

18
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:50,500
I work as a computer science teacher at Pinecrest School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

19
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:56,060
And I am the co-host with Sean here for Teaching Python.

20
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,960
And I'm Sean Tybur and I am now a senior cloud engineer at Mondalis International.

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,960
We make cookies.

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,300
Not the kind that go in your browser, but we make Oreos and Nutter Butters and all kinds

23
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,300
of fun stuff.

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,760
And I'm the other coach, co-host of Teaching Python.

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,260
But before this, Kelly and I worked together teaching middle school computer science to

26
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,300
over 1,000 students.

27
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,140
Okay.

28
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,940
So why should you believe us?

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,220
As a fact that I've been with middle school students for about 20 something years, please

30
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,060
don't judge, we have taught kids to code in Python.

31
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,740
We used an iterative approach to making our curriculum.

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,020
We got to do this four times a year for every grade level.

33
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,340
And then Sean kept saying, no, we can do better.

34
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:48,420
So we've actually taught our courses 50 times plus and then more than 1,000 kids in the

35
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,860
little bit of three years.

36
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,260
Yeah, and this is now the way that kids learn is the way we learn ourselves.

37
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,900
So we've been learning from our students to be able to learn better.

38
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,220
And it really does work.

39
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,220
It's really effective.

40
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,520
And just a side note, I've only been coding for four years.

41
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,820
So today, what we'd like for you to take away as an outcome is we want you to get a peek

42
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,260
at the 12 year old brain, right?

43
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,860
No one can fully understand the brain of a 12 year old, right?

44
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,100
But you're going to get a peek at the way that their brain works and the way that they

45
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,980
learn things.

46
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,620
That's so that you can learn Python better as an adult.

47
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,500
And we want you to have more control over your learning so that it feels like something

48
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,180
that you can direct and move through in a way that suits you best.

49
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:36,820
OK, now, your brain is a little bit different than a 12 year olds.

50
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,300
We hope even though you may feel like you're 12 on the inside, right?

51
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,540
I feel like you're 12 on the inside all the time, all the time.

52
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,620
A 12 year old's brain has a lot of neuroplasticity naturally.

53
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,620
It just happens.

54
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,340
They're designed and wired for learning, right?

55
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,460
They really don't have a lot of a strong sense of risk and risk taking like the consequences

56
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,180
of that behavior, right?

57
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,900
And they're learning broadly all day long.

58
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:08,240
As an adult, like the androgyny, this is the science of how adults learn, your neuroplasticity

59
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,580
is something you have to work for.

60
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,420
So you have to be the one making your mind more nimble and making connections, right?

61
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,380
You also have a much stronger sense of risk.

62
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,820
And there's a lot of other factors that go into the way that you learn differently, right?

63
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,900
But what we're going to do is talk about some things that are really important for 12 year

64
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,780
olds that maybe you forgot about a little bit that you can bring back to your learning

65
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:38,140
and will help you learn in a much more interesting, fun and effective way.

66
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,780
So first and foremost, kids are curious, super curious.

67
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,140
I love teaching middle school because every single day there's a why, but how, but can

68
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,140
I, but why did you do that and what can I do more?

69
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,420
And it's this constant curiosity that keeps them in this learning phase.

70
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,940
And as adults, as you know, we get entrenched and when we talk about curiosity, we think

71
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,940
in a very narrow way, like I'm very curious about this one little thing.

72
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,960
We're talking about broad curiosity, right?

73
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,760
We're talking about the ways that we think about the things that are happening around

74
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,440
us and always asking questions and trying to understand.

75
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:21,080
So it's really important to keep in mind that as a 12 year old and as any learner, the mind

76
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,920
is a muscle.

77
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,600
And just like going to the gym every day to work out your muscle, you need to work out

78
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,360
your brain muscle and needs to be exercised.

79
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,760
And you need to engage it on these multiple levels.

80
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,540
You can't just keep working on one side of your brain or the frontal lobe of your brain.

81
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,640
You need to work the entire brain.

82
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Curiosity is a cognitive skill.

83
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,700
It is something that we can learn.

84
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,180
It helps us to stimulate more learning.

85
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,660
It builds purpose in our life and satisfaction in what we're doing.

86
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,740
So I always tell my parents, your brain is getting older.

87
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,580
You're going to start forgetting things.

88
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,960
So you need to maintain this curiosity as you get older in order to help prevent this

89
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,100
cognitive decline in your brain and the function.

90
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,100
And something that's really important too is using all of your senses to learn, right?

91
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,500
We as programmers and coders, we tend to use a lot of visual cues, right?

92
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,020
We were looking at our screens while we're coding.

93
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,920
We're feeling the keyboard as we're typing.

94
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,140
But there are other senses that you can engage.

95
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,320
For example, I learn best when I have a hot cup of coffee in my hand.

96
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,400
It's the smell of it.

97
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
It's the warmth.

98
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
It's the taste of it.

99
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,420
It's like a signal to my brain that says, okay, it's learning time, right?

100
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,860
So sometimes that gets me in trouble because you can't drink coffee at 8 o'clock at night

101
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,260
and live to tell the tale, right?

102
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,260
Then you're up until midnight or later.

103
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,360
Sometimes you need that as a teacher.

104
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
That's true.

105
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
That's true.

106
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,940
So it's important to engage all of your senses.

107
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,260
How am I feeling?

108
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,680
What does this learning experience feel like?

109
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,820
Not just what can I see?

110
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,360
And so in Python, as we're learning Python, the way to hack this is to really question

111
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,680
everything, right?

112
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,040
Ask yourself, how does this work?

113
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,240
Why does this work?

114
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,120
Maybe you can't recursively iterate all the way down to the base of the binary that's

115
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,640
happening on your CPU.

116
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,600
But you can ask yourself, why is this part working with this other part?

117
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,040
How are these things working together?

118
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,480
How do they interact in a new way?

119
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,360
You can also read new code samples.

120
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,300
You can look at different code other than the kind you write all the time.

121
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,300
Trey Hunter's talk yesterday, Python Audities Explained, was a really great example of this

122
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,740
because there's a lot of weird things that happen sometimes in Python that you look at

123
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,860
and you say, that doesn't make any sense.

124
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,140
And so it gets you to be curious about these things.

125
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,220
When something unexpected happens, ask why is this happening?

126
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,220
How is this happening?

127
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,560
That curiosity is really important.

128
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,420
When there are books like Fluent Python has really great examples of ways to do things

129
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,080
differently, more effectively, maybe more Pythonically.

130
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,020
Those are all great ways to stretch your curiosity and learn about things because our students

131
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,240
don't just ask, did I get it to work?

132
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,960
They're asking, why did it work this way?

133
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,640
Or is there a different way that I can do this?

134
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,980
And that curiosity is really important.

135
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:12,720
And also, I always ask and I tell the students, oh, well, why don't you go look at PyPI?

136
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,420
Go look at all the other libraries out there.

137
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,200
You may not understand them, but it's going to open your eyes to what you can do with

138
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Python.

139
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,980
And we challenge you to try that, too.

140
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,660
Go randomly click through the libraries.

141
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,660
Yeah.

142
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,180
And something that's kind of fun, and we don't think about this because we're always sometimes

143
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,300
maybe programmed to think about, is this the best way?

144
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,100
Ask yourself, is there a worse way to do this?

145
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,380
What's the way that isn't as optimal?

146
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,400
Or is there a really bad way of implementing?

147
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,260
Because it stimulates your brain.

148
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,260
Why is it wrong?

149
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,280
Why does it make things work worse than the way I have it?

150
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,680
So a good way to do that sometimes is to go search on GitHub for a package you're using,

151
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
right?

152
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,760
Look through the samples of people using that code in their projects.

153
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Are they using it well?

154
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,900
Are they not using it well?

155
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,900
Ask yourself those questions.

156
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:05,060
And it's a great way to learn new ways of doing things and stretch your curiosity.

157
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,180
So 12-year-olds are always learning.

158
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,240
They may not be learning what their teachers want them to learn, but they're always learning.

159
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,400
They're trying everything in a new way.

160
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,300
They're challenging opportunities in their world.

161
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,500
A middle school student has six to eight subjects in a given day, plus sports, plus arts, plus

162
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,920
after school reading, plus YouTube, plus Minecraft, plus Fortnite, and that can go on and on.

163
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,820
And they're constantly learning how they can improve, how they can play the game better,

164
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:44,220
how they can do something easier, how they can probably get their homework done quicker.

165
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:51,720
And it's rare, though, that they're good at everything all the time, but they still keep learning.

166
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:00,100
And what happens when you keep learning, and I'll put my kids in the situation, when they're

167
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:07,160
learning, for example, something in Minecraft, or they're trying to do something in code,

168
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:14,320
it's this feel-good brain hormone that gets released when they do it, and it comes back

169
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,760
with a reward.

170
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,800
This neuroplasticity, this working memory, this muscle workout that they do while they're

171
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,520
learning, whether it's with Python or with math or English, it optimizes the brain functions.

172
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,640
It helps the movement from the short-term to the long-term memory, and helps them to

173
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,960
build more connections.

174
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,060
And most importantly, it fosters creativity.

175
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:43,100
And that's something that we want, creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship in our students.

176
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,540
So we want them to learn other things, not just Python, not just math, but anything that

177
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:54,380
they can get their hands on to increase that brain activity.

178
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,540
And so how to hack your own Python learning.

179
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,300
So if you're learning Python as a beginner, if this is the new thing that you're learning,

180
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,780
make space for focus time and diffuse time.

181
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:10,100
Make those moments where you step away from it and you go for a walk or you try something

182
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,380
else, something where you're maybe engaging your hands or other motor skills so that your

183
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:20,140
brain has time to shift into neutral and process everything that it just learned.

184
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:26,460
But if you're an expert in Python, if you've been coding in Python for a long time, maybe

185
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,260
the answer is to learn something new that's not Python.

186
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,700
Learn something totally different that makes you uncomfortable, that's new, and that you

187
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,220
can link back to the things that you already know.

188
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,900
So these ideas of connecting concepts and finding things that you can take from something

189
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:49,460
new that you're learning to something that you know really well is a proven way to increase

190
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,900
the cognitive abilities that you have in your brain.

191
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,460
Increases creativity, it makes it more fun, it increases your confidence, it's really,

192
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,740
really great.

193
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,020
And so you can create those connections and build metaphors when you have these outside

194
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,140
experiences.

195
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,420
Another thing that's really important is to meet people with new perspectives, people

196
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,020
who can stimulate your brain in new ways.

197
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,500
Like at a Python conference where you're all here, right?

198
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,220
Meet someone new, sit at a new table, ask someone, get curious about what they're doing

199
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,980
and what you can learn from them.

200
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,700
And that newness of it is going to stimulate your brain in really interesting ways.

201
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,340
I have to say that I've met somebody that was talking about building bridges in Python.

202
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,260
Anthony Shaw was trying to convince me that I need to teach binary code.

203
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,860
So there's all these really cool things that you can do and meet from people.

204
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,700
So this one you've already got a huge step forward.

205
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,540
You're here, you're at PyCon, you can meet new people all around you and it's something

206
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,060
that is a great way to jump start your learning.

207
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,100
But don't sit in front of the TV, right?

208
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,020
Don't just sit there and like absorb content because it doesn't actually help your brain

209
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,220
work better.

210
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,740
This is something where going for a walk or learning how to knit or do something with

211
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,060
your hands, do woodworking, anything that can let your brain kind of idle along and

212
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,820
process is what's really going to help you kind of process all the new things that you're

213
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
learning.

214
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,980
Okay, so this one's my favorite.

215
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,980
I know.

216
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,980
Well the next one, yes, go ahead.

217
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,060
Twelve year olds are emotive, right?

218
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,500
If you don't know that word, it means that they express emotion, right?

219
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,980
They may not always understand what they're feeling, but they are definitely feeling it.

220
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,780
You can sit there and look at a kid learning to code or learning how to figure out something

221
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,340
in Python, whether it's how to iterate over a list.

222
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,100
You can tell when they're frustrated.

223
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,220
You can tell when they're like, they're determined they're going to get it, right?

224
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,620
So for these two wonderful girls, we love these girls.

225
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,860
And then when they get it, you see the smiles.

226
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,460
They emote that energy of, I feel good.

227
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,820
I like this, right?

228
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,300
So we can learn a lot about being emotive.

229
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,660
Adults are kind of good at hiding their feelings or suppressing them or kind of pushing them

230
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,720
to the side because we're professionals, right?

231
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,060
We need to get this done.

232
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,180
You should be able to say, yeah, I did it, right?

233
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,460
Or this was awesome and like fist pump or whatever it is that you do to celebrate that

234
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,260
emotion.

235
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:19,180
So this is really huge in the cognitive parts of your brain without getting into too much

236
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,780
of the brain science.

237
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,620
If you haven't heard of Barbara Oakley, check her out because she explains the brain science

238
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,380
of learning.

239
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,400
But learning with emotions instead of against emotions.

240
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,380
First and foremost, I'll do the negative.

241
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:39,260
We know for a fact, and hopefully you've seen this too, when you or your child or the children

242
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,020
around you, they're stressed or you're stressed.

243
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,500
Learning does not happen.

244
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:51,140
It physically cannot happen because your body, your brain was built to shut off and only

245
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,700
causing you anxiety or stress.

246
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,180
Therefore, you have to acknowledge this stress.

247
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:02,740
You have to acknowledge what is the thing that makes you want to slam your YAML.

248
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,460
Yeah, yelling at my laptop.

249
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,460
Yeah, that.

250
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,220
You have to acknowledge that because at that point of time, you're not learning.

251
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,980
So emotions are the key to making that knowledge permanent.

252
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,080
Understanding the roles of each emotion, learning what to do with them, how to react with them,

253
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,440
that's really helpful.

254
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,080
And there's strong evidence for the neuroscience behind it.

255
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,800
There's these feel-good hormones that happen and get released.

256
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,600
It's oxytocin, dopamine, and another norepinephrine.

257
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
I can't say that one.

258
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
I've only read it.

259
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Norepinephrine?

260
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
I don't know.

261
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
That one.

262
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,800
But it's mostly dopamine, which is the one that gets released.

263
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,520
And it's that having fun moment that makes you remember.

264
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,480
And we're not saying, oh, go eat a piece of chocolate and enjoy your ice cream or your

265
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,440
coffee, and that's going to help you learn.

266
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,960
You actually have to feel that emotive side, that happiness, in order to trigger the dopamine

267
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,080
to remember.

268
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,480
And stay away from that stress because that cortisol, that stuff that gets you, puts a

269
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,880
stop to that process of going from your short term to your long term and making those myelin

270
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,720
connections.

271
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,840
So how do you hack this?

272
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,240
So how do you make your learning more effective?

273
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,560
The first thing to do is to chunk your learning into smaller pieces.

274
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,880
That way, you shorten that reward cycle and you get more frequent hits of dopamine when

275
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,520
you are successful at completing something.

276
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,480
And you've seen this probably a lot with the style of coding.

277
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,700
If you're sitting there for hours trying to figure something out and you don't get up

278
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:42,240
and you don't move and you don't have something that is the end of that phase, you get more

279
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,560
and more tired, more and more stressed.

280
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,600
Your shoulders hunch up.

281
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,400
You kind of bend in, inwards, right?

282
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,800
But if you can break your learning into small chunks, the Pomodoro method works really well

283
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
here.

284
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Learn for 20 minutes.

285
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,880
Take a five minute break.

286
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,240
That way, you force yourself to chunk that learning and you reward your brain for doing

287
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,160
something really well.

288
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,840
You also want to create intrinsic reward systems.

289
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,040
So the difference between an intrinsic reward versus an extrinsic reward.

290
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,960
An extrinsic reward is I did awesome.

291
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,480
I'm going to eat a piece of chocolate.

292
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,560
An intrinsic reward is I did something great.

293
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,080
I'm going to post that on Twitter and share it with everyone because I'm really happy

294
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
about it.

295
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,200
So the extrinsic reward is something that you give yourself and kind of replaces those

296
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,840
hormones versus the intrinsic reward is something that makes you feel good from the inside and

297
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,840
rewards those hormones.

298
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,880
And then the other thing to do, especially as you start to chunk this learning, is to

299
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,080
check in on your emotional state.

300
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,520
So I want to talk about the learning that you've accomplished.

301
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,160
Not just the learning that you've accomplished, but how are you feeling right now?

302
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,000
How do you feel about what you just did?

303
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,360
And I know that this sounds touchy feely maybe or kind of soft and fuzzy, but it's actually

304
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,880
really important because as Kelly talked about, if you're feeling stressed and you're not

305
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,840
acknowledging that, if you're not recognizing it, it means that you're going to continue

306
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,840
to feel stressed and continue to block the learning from actually happening.

307
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:19,480
And I'm going to let you do this one too because this one's my favorite.

308
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,640
Twelve year olds take risks in their learning, intellectual risks.

309
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,800
One of the last things you develop cognitively in your brain as you become an adult is your

310
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,840
sense of risk and reward calculations.

311
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,800
Twelve year olds, it's measured, have a pretty poor or in some cases completely absent sense

312
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,640
of risk and reward.

313
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,960
But this is actually an evolutionary trait that's really important because removing that

314
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,360
risk reward, as long as they're protected and in a safe place, allows them to learn

315
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:58,240
faster, more creatively and make connections that we as adults maybe inhibit.

316
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,000
And so as an adult, about 20% of the cells in your brain are there to inhibit risk taking

317
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,440
behaviors to keep you alive and safe and all of those things.

318
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,840
But in kids that doesn't exist.

319
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,880
So there's not that stop gap to say, maybe this isn't such a good idea.

320
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,680
You mean teachers and students know not to fly drones indoors?

321
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
We do now.

322
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,480
Almost hit me in the face.

323
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Just saying.

324
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,120
But he learned not to use that button again.

325
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
Really quick.

326
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,400
All right.

327
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,320
So learning Python with courage.

328
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,880
This is something that I personally took in for myself.

329
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,120
Four years ago, my boss told me about, you know, I'm a biology major.

330
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,960
Yes, I did robotics a lot.

331
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Said to me, guess what?

332
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,600
I need you to teach Python.

333
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,640
And I looked at her and I said, I've never had a coding class in my entire life.

334
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,040
Don't worry, you can do it.

335
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,280
And I took this intellectual risk.

336
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,040
I had to learn Python in three months before I taught it to sixth and seventh graders.

337
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,280
It was a horrible first quarter.

338
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,640
I'm not going to lie.

339
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,680
But the amount of learning that I did in that time was great.

340
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:12,400
This intellectual risk that kids, we put kids into, allows them to build this confidence

341
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,600
and to make this creative, you know, make all these creative things.

342
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,400
The best thing that I love about teaching middle school students is that they come up

343
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,880
with the things that I believe because of my constraints can't work.

344
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,040
And they proved to me that they can.

345
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,840
creativity to go with the things that you believe in.

346
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,640
And this is not the same as being fearless is not the same as launching a whole bunch

347
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,560
of drones in a classroom.

348
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,600
But it is a reward.

349
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,960
There's still that dopamine release when you take an intellectual risk and you are successful

350
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,760
or you take an intellectual risk and you fail, but you learn something from that failure.

351
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,960
I'm not saying that the intellectual risk with failure is bad at all because as long

352
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,720
as you're taking that risk, that dopamine will still come out as long as you keep the

353
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,440
stress under cover and you gain more learning and memory faster.

354
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,880
So the important thing for your learning as an adult is to create spaces where you can

355
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,780
take that risk, right?

356
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,880
So maybe you're not ready to take a risk in front of your colleagues, your co-workers,

357
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,600
your partner or spouse or whoever that you care about most.

358
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,960
But maybe you can create a space where you can take risks where other people don't see

359
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,520
it unless you want them to or create a space where there's people that you trust that you

360
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,400
can work with.

361
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:43,800
So for example, if you're a web developer, try adding some data science, try learning

362
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:50,800
some electronics, try learning the piano, try learning something that you don't know.

363
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,440
Another big risk, try teaching someone else.

364
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,160
Like Kelly, I hadn't coded in Python even though I had formal education, I hadn't coded

365
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
in Python.

366
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,280
I had to learn that in order to teach it.

367
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,840
That's a lot of risk to your ego when you have to get up in front of a room of kids

368
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:16,440
and say, here's what I think we're going to do and it probably goes wrong, but we learn.

369
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,080
Or like we said earlier with trying to find a worse way of doing things, try building

370
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,400
something or making something that you're pretty sure is going to fail.

371
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,240
Because in the event that it actually works, the reward is huge.

372
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,000
So don't always take the safe bet.

373
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,920
Try something new, try something big and meaty and wild and see what happens.

374
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:45,080
And the risk for us as adults is we don't want to feel like we're silly or stupid or

375
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,000
that we don't get it.

376
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,800
And the reality is we all feel that way sometimes.

377
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,120
Imposter syndrome is a real thing.

378
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,560
But everyone here wants you to succeed.

379
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,000
We want you to be successful.

380
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,440
And only some people really take displeasure in other people's failures.

381
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
I don't know who they are.

382
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
I don't know either.

383
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,160
But I like this quote and I'm going to say it, Picasso, he says, I always seek out the

384
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,320
things I cannot do so that I may learn to do them.

385
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,320
And if you take on that challenge in learning Python and learning writing PyScript, because

386
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,160
I really want that in my school soon, so some people out there helping PyScript, go take

387
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
a risk.

388
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Right.

389
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,120
And if we can do it, you can too.

390
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,880
Four years ago, I had never taught a class in my life and I've taught hundreds of students

391
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
now.

392
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,240
Kelly had never written a line of code in her life.

393
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,040
Thousands now.

394
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,480
And she teaches the intro to Python, the beginning steps, way better than I do now.

395
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,200
She's amazing, right?

396
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,160
Because she was willing to take the risk.

397
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
Thank you.

398
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
All right.

399
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:54,840
So this is probably my favorite part about brain science, is this whole meta and this

400
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,520
meta cognition activity.

401
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,640
Sean and I did this after every quarter.

402
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:06,160
I still call him on FaceTime and I need to meta out this activity that's not working.

403
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,960
And it's this process of reflection.

404
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,280
Again, the more times that you're passing from your short term to your long term memory,

405
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:20,480
this myelin wraps around your neuron and it makes that memory, that learning stick.

406
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,140
The more myelin you have, the more opportunities to find connections.

407
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:31,280
So this meta part, this reflecting, is a process of learning.

408
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,320
So we always like to ask our students, what is it that you learned today?

409
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,560
Or what do you think about your learning today?

410
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,760
Or what didn't you know before today?

411
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,400
Or where are you going to go after today?

412
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,680
It's this opportunity to sort through all the experiences and identify what makes it

413
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,280
important to you.

414
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,480
Remember, we're looking for that dopamine.

415
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,480
We're looking for that connection.

416
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,960
And it's kind of like today, we apply this to our presentation.

417
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,680
We meta'd it out forever.

418
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,720
So think about it this way.

419
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,680
As you've been sitting here, there have been times when you've been checked out, right?

420
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,520
There have been times when you went and looked at your Twitter feed or your mind drifted

421
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,960
off into something else.

422
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,280
What were those times when that happened?

423
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,960
Which parts of the presentation were less interesting to you?

424
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,440
What other parts when you were on Twitter did you go, oh, wait, wait, what did they

425
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,440
just say?

426
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,760
I want to hear more about that.

427
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,880
So this reflective process is really important because if we start to think about the way

428
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,960
we learn, we can become more effective learners.

429
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,300
And so you can apply this not just to the presentations you see here at PyCon, but say

430
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,700
that YouTube video that you're watching, the tutorial, which parts of the web page

431
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,220
am I skimming past in the documentation because I can't access it?

432
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:46,580
Start to think about how you're learning and what things are working really, really well

433
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,460
and which things are maybe not as effective in making your mind drift and wander.

434
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,140
I'm going to add in real quick something that we started doing is the start, stop, and continue.

435
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:01,020
What Sean brought in from the business world is something of what am I going to start doing?

436
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,020
What am I going to stop doing?

437
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,780
And what can I continue to do in my learning with Python?

438
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,780
So maybe I'm going to stop doing turtle Python because that's what my kids love and I'm really

439
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:15,480
getting really good at Python turtle and start doing something else, maybe like requests.

440
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,420
Or I'm going to continue doing simple apps and making music with Python code because

441
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,860
that's really working for the kids.

442
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,580
So start, stop, and continue.

443
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,460
And we're on track to finish a couple minutes early.

444
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:32,940
So when we stop, but before you get up from your chair, we want you to ask yourself these

445
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,260
questions.

446
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,260
What can I start doing?

447
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,380
What will I stop doing?

448
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,980
And where will I go next in my learning?

449
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,140
So don't just get up right away.

450
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,460
Take a minute and just think about it for a second.

451
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,060
Close your eyes and think.

452
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:50,340
And then write it down or do something with it.

453
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,700
And so now our challenge to you.

454
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,860
Go out and learn something that scares you a bit.

455
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,620
Like shark wrestling or public speaking.

456
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,300
My hands aren't shaking anymore.

457
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,540
And then add reflections to your learning process.

458
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,820
Be more aware and more mindful of the way that you're learning new things and then start

459
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,780
to hack that process.

460
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,300
Start looking at ways that you can make it better, more effective, cut out the parts

461
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,700
that don't work, try something new in your learning process.

462
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,700
Make it really great.

463
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,700
Yeah.

464
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,500
And then to the younger people out there, I challenge you to talk to your parents and

465
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,580
let them know how you're learning.

466
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,020
Ask them questions.

467
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,780
Ask them why things happen, because even if they don't know why something is working the

468
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:38,580
way they are, you can go search it up and you can learn more through that process.

469
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,740
So then once you've done all that, email us, tell us about it.

470
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,740
We're on Twitter.

471
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,780
We have our weekly podcast biweekly every month.

472
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,500
Depending on how I'm feeling, we'll see.

473
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,540
But you can listen to all our back catalog at teaching python.fm.

474
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,540
We've got a whole range of experiences, some really amazing guests that have taught us

475
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,380
so much and we've learned so much from.

476
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,980
And we can't wait to hear from you.

477
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,940
So for teaching python, this is Sean.

478
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,460
This is Kelly, signing off.

479
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,460
All right.

480
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:05,480
Thank you, everyone.
