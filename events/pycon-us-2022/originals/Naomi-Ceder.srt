1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,220
I am very pleased to introduce you to our final keynote. She is a Python user since

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,640
2001, a PyCon US attendee since 2003, one of the originators of the poster session,

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,500
the education summit, the intro to sprint sessions, the PyCon charlas and the hatchery

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,440
programs. She's the co-founder of Transcode. I could go on and on about everything she's

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,640
done for this community, absolutely one of our most prolific community members. I am

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,160
pleased to introduce Naomi Cedar.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:44,400
Well, good afternoon. I'm honored and delighted to be here. And before anything else, I'd

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:56,560
like to note that this is our 20th PyCon. Yes, number 20. My 20th PyCon as well, I might

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:04,560
add. And I would like to give my deepest thanks to the organizers, the staff, the volunteers,

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:18,120
and to all of you for making this such a joyful return to the world. So thank you all.

11
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:27,960
Now, I call this talk a time of gifts. And that's inspired by this little gem of a travel

12
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:36,440
memoir that was written by a man named Patrick Lee Fermer, who in the 1930s, after being

13
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,960
thrown out of his last year of British public school because he wasn't serious enough, decided

14
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:52,120
Netherlands, up the Rhine, across Europe, down the Danube, and ultimately to Istanbul.

15
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:59,040
Now this took him a couple of years, but the focus of his book is not on the places and

16
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,740
the sites he visited, nor is it on the historic events that were unfolding around him because

17
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,800
he was crossing Germany and Austria as the Nazis were coming to power. Yet he seems to

18
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:20,840
barely notice that. Instead, he is interested in the people he met along the way, boatmen,

19
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:29,040
truck drivers, farmers, shopkeepers, even occasionally an aristocrat, and their gifts

20
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:37,480
of food, shelter, and companionship, which sustained him along the way in that long journey.

21
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:45,120
For me, and I would imagine for many of you, my time in this community has been my time

22
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:53,000
of gifts. Gifts that have sustained me in so many ways on my journey over the past 20

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,440
years to various continents, across two genders, through different stages of my life. So that

24
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,480
led me to think about how we value and share the gifts of our community and how people

25
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,040
have compared open source communities like the Python community to a gift economy. Now

26
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:25,000
here at PyCon the other day I heard somebody say, in Python people know how open source

27
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:32,080
works. Maybe. There are a lot of ways to look at communities, and I wonder if that understanding

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
of how open source works is the same for everyone. I certainly expect there are a lot of opinions.

29
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:48,520
But I do think it's important for communities to think about and to articulate how they

30
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:55,520
think their principles should work, how their communities should work. And I want to present

31
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,520
a way of thinking about our community that makes sense to me. And who knows, maybe it

32
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:08,520
will at least be fodder for some discussion. So to be clear, what I'm about to say is purely

33
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,520
my own opinion. I stepped away from the PSF board two years ago. Please don't blame any

34
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,400
of them for this. And I would say that as a community, a community that is organized

35
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,600
around an open source language and an open source ecosystem, we do have a gift orientation.

36
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,800
The thumbnail definition of this is that people contribute what they can when they can and

37
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,560
turn, share resources and help contribute it by others in the community. The thing is,

38
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,560
we're so used to the values of a market economy that it's sort of hard for us to consciously

39
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:01,760
grasp how this works. This kind of gift giving is not barter. We're not doing a one for one

40
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,760
exchange at the same time and the goal isn't to come out even or actually some studies

41
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:15,760
say that a lot of cultures use barter as a way to kind of take people from a different

42
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,760
group. It's not that. That's not what I'm talking about. Instead, I'm talking about

43
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:26,760
someone contributes something and then at a later time they're going to share something

44
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:34,760
that someone else has contributed. No one can demand a gift, yet everyone accepts that

45
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:43,760
they're going to contribute as they can. For example, in hunter gatherer societies, if

46
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,760
somebody finds some food or makes a kill or whatever, they share it with the entire group

47
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:55,760
knowing that everybody else is going to do the same thing if they get the chance. So

48
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:02,760
this is the sort of gift giving that I think we see a lot of in our Python communities.

49
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,160
Some people are contributing code, others documentation, still others the labor to hold

50
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,200
community events like this one and all of those gifts are freely given and everybody

51
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:20,200
enjoys the benefits, right? I mean, it's kind of like a utopian and narco syndicalist commune

52
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,520
or what the animals had in animal farm before the pigs turned into totalitarian dictators.

53
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:35,000
I think for many of us who love this community, this is the narrative that we turn to particularly

54
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
in misty nostalgic moments which old timers like me experience every PyCon. But I think

55
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,400
in those moments we tend to forget that things are never quite that simple, never quite that

56
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:56,400
perfect, never quite that idyllic. As Python and our community, our projects and our gatherings

57
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:05,760
have grown, things are not so clear. In fact, a lot of people these days I think are questioning

58
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:14,200
whether this model of open source powered by gifts is still sustainable. I suppose part

59
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,720
of the problem is that the open source world in general and Python in particular have been

60
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,800
almost too successful. Even as we've grown in every aspect, the number of users and their

61
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:40,200
demands has grown exponentially faster. How can such a relatively tiny group of volunteers

62
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:47,200
keep a community and a language used by millions going? And I think if we look a little bit,

63
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:55,760
it's easy to find examples where things go wrong. One issue in particular is burnout of

64
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:03,480
the volunteers that make everything work. Many times I've seen what I call shooting

65
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:11,040
stars. These are people who burst onto the scene and start contributing to the community

66
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,840
usually in multiple ways showing seemingly superhuman amounts of energy and enthusiasm.

67
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,120
Only a few months after their first events they're organizing other events, they're teaching

68
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,880
courses, they're contributing code and more. And they're so successful, they're so eager

69
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,160
to help that we give them more and give them more and give them more to do to the point

70
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:43,160
that people like me start wondering how can anyone possibly do that? The answer usually

71
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,800
is that they can't, at least not for very long. And in those cases we'll start to notice

72
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,800
them getting tired, enthusiasm fading, even as they get involved in more and more things.

73
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,920
I've had some people like this take me aside and quietly ask me how to deal with the stress,

74
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:09,320
how to keep all of the balls in the air. And when I tell them that the answer is to do

75
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:15,160
less, they have a hard time accepting that. Sometimes I think maybe they would like to,

76
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,920
but by now they don't have the time. They've got an event to organize, a blog post to edit,

77
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,920
or code to write, or calls to jump on, or whatever it might be. And in many cases, not all,

78
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,440
but in many cases, after a few months, a couple years maybe, they start to fade. Emails will

79
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,320
go unanswered, deadlines will slip, pull requests ignored, calls missed, whatever it might be,

80
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,080
because the demands of all that they were doing for free as volunteers, combined with

81
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,720
work, family, everything else, it's literally sucked all of the energy out of them. The

82
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,240
tank is empty, they have no more to give, and the relationship then between them and

83
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:08,240
the community is damaged, often irreparably. I've also seen people who've maybe started

84
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,240
slower, focused on one thing built over the years until they've become key developers,

85
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,240
maintainers of a project, key community organizers, and they've been doing what they've been doing

86
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,240
for many years, usually hearing more complaints than praise, and they feel like their work

87
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,200
is being taken for granted. In many cases, they may have too much invested emotionally

88
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:41,200
to walk away, but they're tired, and they're wondering how long they can hold on. In fact,

89
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,120
sometimes these leaders have given so much more than anyone else, they end up kind of

90
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,560
running the project alone. They hold the credentials, whenever something needs to be done, it goes

91
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,960
through them, and when they're encouraged to share the load, they tend to say, oh, now

92
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,320
I can handle it, and besides, it's more work to train somebody new, or I don't know how

93
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:10,320
to onboard somebody, or there are lots of things that will keep them from doing that.

94
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,840
On the other side, we have people who would love to contribute, and we see this all the

95
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:22,840
time where they're eager to contribute something, but for one reason or another, it goes wrong.

96
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,920
They might be ignored because nobody knows how to onboard them. Maybe the people running

97
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,800
that project think they have enough people already. Maybe they're just talking to the

98
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,800
wrong people, or maybe they're trying to contribute something that isn't appropriate. Maybe they're

99
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:48,800
trying to come in way above the level of what they actually understand. Now, if that's the

100
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,360
case, if they're trying to come in at 2IL level, they can usually be redirected to something

101
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,920
maybe a little bit more appropriate to start out on, but for a lot of those others, it

102
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:05,840
seems to me they just fall through the cracks, and each time they try to get involved and

103
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:12,840
somehow get turned away, they're less likely to try again, and we end up losing those people.

104
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:20,480
So the end result is that our projects, our community initiatives, whatever it might be,

105
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,880
are at the risk of dying as people burn out and are not replaced, and that's how we end

106
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:33,880
up finding projects that are abandoned with unanswered issues, ignored PRs, out of date

107
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,880
dependencies. We find community initiatives with deserted mailing lists, ghost town slacks,

108
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,160
all of that, and occasionally maybe one of these will be revived, but most of the time

109
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:58,160
they're just left behind. So some people see this as just the way that open source projects

110
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:05,160
work. I was reading an article a couple weeks ago on the sustainability of open source,

111
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:13,960
and a developer and maintainer of several Java projects characterized open source as,

112
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,240
this is a quote, a model that relies on people giving more than they can for very little

113
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:28,600
or nothing in return, hoping that there will be someone to take over the mantle when the

114
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:35,600
previous person burns out. That description of how open source works tells me that if

115
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,560
we are in fact a gift giving culture, which I would argue we are, things are going wrong.

116
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,920
We have people giving more than they can sustain, others who are barely able to sustain what

117
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,600
they give but feel they aren't receiving anything in return. By the way, I'm sure

118
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,300
that these feelings of not getting anything in return are made worse by seeing companies

119
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,640
all over the place use their work for free in place of things that they had been paying

120
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:12,640
tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars for without acknowledgement, usually without them

121
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,720
giving back anything too. That's a very demoralizing thing. Then also, as I mentioned, we have

122
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,920
other people who feel that their gifts are being rejected. This last is actually a pretty

123
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:35,400
serious thing. In gift giving cultures, refusing someone's gift is an insult. You're basically

124
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:42,400
telling them you don't want them to be part of your community. That happens. I'm sure

125
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,720
that happens. It's no wonder that they're not going to be around to help take over

126
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,720
a project. Clearly, there are some challenges that we face as an open source community.

127
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:04,320
Question is, what do we do about it? What can we do about it? To my mind, the first

128
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:12,320
step is to understand what's going on. What are the motivations and the values that are

129
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:19,880
driving our community? I think this is important. I know from many experiences in my life that

130
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:29,160
the narrative, the way that you think about something has an enormous impact on how you

131
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,640
are able to deal with it. Sometimes there are ways of thinking about a problem that

132
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:42,640
will actually keep you from finding a solution. Indeed, there are many times where I've found

133
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:50,240
that changing, clarifying, modifying the narrative, the way that you are actually thinking about

134
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:59,040
the problem is an essential first step in dealing with that situation.

135
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,680
So, what does drive our communities? Why are we here at a conference like this where there

136
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:17,320
is so much talk about community? Well, again, this is for the old timers in the room. Twenty

137
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:24,760
years ago, the most popular explanation, at least according to the cathedral in the bazaar,

138
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,800
the old timers know what I'm talking about, was that open source was driven by self-interest.

139
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:38,400
Enlightened self-interest, perhaps, because it was much easier to get what you wanted

140
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:45,400
if you were agreeable, but still self-interest. People only worked on what interested or benefited

141
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:54,160
them, the famous scratch your own itch. Beyond that, the only other motivation for doing

142
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,960
open source things was the ego boost that you would get from reflecting that you were

143
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:06,960
the one to solve a problem and that everyone interested in that project would know that.

144
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:14,520
In fact, even if you were to do something nice, something completely altruistic, without

145
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:20,500
an explicit ego boost for payback, that was only because you could then reflect upon how

146
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:26,540
noble you were and get your ego boost that way. In other words, no matter what you did,

147
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:33,540
it was self-interest all the way down. Along with this, there was this belief that if you

148
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:41,060
had enough genially selfish people working to scratch only their own itches and boost

149
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:46,660
their own egos, this would somehow result in the best of all possible worlds for everyone.

150
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:52,940
Now, as you may notice, this view doesn't have any room for community, for service,

151
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:59,940
for altruism. If that's the view you've got of open source, then there is no problem with

152
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:08,180
any of the examples I mentioned before. You've got rapid burnout and departure. Well, level

153
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,580
of their interest is no longer high enough for them to continue. Must not have achieved

154
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:19,580
enough ego boosts. It's the way it goes. Your volunteers are exhausted. Well, look, if they're

155
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:27,500
doing what they want, they'll continue. When the rewards aren't great enough, they'll

156
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:33,980
quit. It's the way it goes. Abandoned projects? Well, that's what happens. There isn't enough

157
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,260
interest. Better learn to deal with that. What about those volunteers who wanted to

158
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:46,980
be volunteers but got turned away? Well, they must not have wanted it bad enough or maybe

159
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:53,340
they weren't smart enough or pushy enough or whatever enough to force their way in.

160
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:59,340
So as I look back on some of that stuff that was sort of a common interpretation of how

161
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:06,340
we worked 20 years ago, it comes off to me as a mix of sort of an adolescent mix of Ayn

162
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:14,340
Rand and liberal capitalism. And mercifully, it seems to be falling out of favor. I hope

163
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:21,260
so. I believe so. And I'm not really trying to claim moral high ground here. I think back

164
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:28,260
in the day, a lot of us didn't really question that at first. Even though in practice, most

165
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,900
people didn't actually behave that way. People weren't actually, as far as I can tell, driven

166
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:40,900
only by ego boosts and self-interest. You know, even in those days, we all benefited

167
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,380
from what we were doing. That was pretty clear. But there were too many people doing things

168
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:54,380
for community, generous things, altruistic things, for self-interest to be even the main

169
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:01,420
thing that was driving us. But if you'd asked, I think a lot of us would have explained,

170
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:08,420
that's how open source works. And to my mind, that narrative of self-interest was damaging

171
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:16,380
to the open source community in general, and to the Python community in particular. And

172
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,900
I think that even now 20 years ago, we're still kind of dealing with the after effects

173
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:28,900
of that. And in fact, I think Brett Cannon's favorite phrase, which I have stolen some

174
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,420
money, no, borrowed, because I did ask permission, which I have used so many times, I came for

175
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:43,260
the language, but I stayed for the community, kind of sums up this change in thinking from

176
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:50,260
the old days on what's important in the world of open source and Python. So that brings

177
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,720
me back to this notion of gift giving as essential in our community. And again, let me go back

178
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:08,700
to the hunter gatherers, the classic example of this. If a hunter makes a kill, they share

179
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:14,540
with everyone. I mean, sure, they want to eat, so there is self-interest, but they also

180
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:20,820
share it with everybody. And it's not even considered to be something special, it's just

181
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:27,760
what you do in that culture. So, you know, we're not hunter gatherers, I'm not suggesting

182
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,380
we go out and make a kill and share, no, no, no, don't get me wrong. But I would argue

183
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:39,280
that this pattern appeals to most of us. I think it appeals to humans in general. And

184
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,160
if you look at how people behave in our community, I think it's pretty easy to see the same ethos

185
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:52,160
at work. People who contribute code do so because they can and because it improves things

186
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:58,760
for everyone. Now, certainly sometimes the code that they contribute addresses a personal

187
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:05,760
need, but many, many times it doesn't. And the same thing is true for people who are,

188
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:12,640
say, on a PSF board or for event organizers. They give a lot of effort, a lot of labor

189
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,640
that doesn't benefit them personally. On the other hand, we can all or we should all be

190
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:26,640
able to count on sharing the benefits of the community. You know, and in addition to the

191
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:35,120
software, things like Python, there are lots of other benefits too, like support and friendship,

192
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,560
maybe it's education and skills, maybe it's professional contacts and increased networks

193
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:49,560
and opportunities. I know that I myself have pretty much benefited from all of the things

194
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:56,640
that I've done, all of those, from being offered my first book deal to making so many

195
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,080
friends from other countries that I now spend a large part of my time learning languages,

196
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:10,080
to PyCon nine years ago, which as it happened, my father died very early on this Sunday morning

197
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:17,400
and there was no way I could get back at any time. And that evening, a number of people

198
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,680
from the community, people that I didn't even really know that well, made a point of sitting

199
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:28,680
with me so that I wouldn't have to deal with that alone. So there are a wide range of benefits

200
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:35,680
that we can get. But the interesting thing for me about the benefits of the community

201
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:47,080
about cultures that rely on gifts is that the whole process is so vague and so messy.

202
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,000
There's really no way to determine that sharing one deer equals so many fish, equals so many

203
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:02,160
apples or whatever, or in our world, there's no way to say that so many code reviews equals

204
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:08,520
a conference talk, equals a board meeting, et cetera. There's no way to keep tit for

205
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:15,560
tat accounts. What we can all count on is that when someone is able, they will make

206
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:22,120
a contribution in which we will all share. And in turn, we will all probably contribute

207
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:29,120
what we can when we can. And this messiness is not a bug. It's a feature. Okay? Not knowing

208
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:36,120
this timing or the precise values of the contributions works to bring people together.

209
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
No one can ever say they're completely even in square with everyone else and walk away.

210
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,560
Instead, there's kind of this realization that our fortunes are all entangled. Okay?

211
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:59,560
We're all in this together. So in other words, this giving of gifts, mutual contribution,

212
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:06,800
is what helps bring people together and create community. And for me, articulating gift giving

213
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,160
is what drives our culture, what creates our community leads me to a couple of things that

214
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:21,160
I think we can do better and things that we need to think about if we want to preserve

215
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:28,960
this community, if we want it to continue to grow and to thrive. So on an individual

216
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:38,600
level, if we consider everyone around us to be contributing to the best of their abilities,

217
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:47,120
to be giving their gifts to the community, I believe we will treat them and ourselves

218
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,960
differently than if we think we're all in it for self-interest and we don't owe anything

219
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:00,960
to anyone. And I would say that understanding that we're all benefiting from the contributions

220
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:10,160
of others makes it easier to appreciate that work, the gifts that they are giving. One

221
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:17,320
hopes it will also prompt us to show that appreciation, something that so many volunteers

222
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:24,320
receive far, far too little of. And it probably should make us less critical of others since

223
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,560
we can understand their contribution is a gift freely given. It's not an obligation.

224
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:36,560
It's not a transaction. And, you know, we think about those shooting stars maybe who

225
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:43,720
burn themselves out. Maybe reflecting on gift giving will help remind them that there is

226
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:51,760
no need for any of us to give more than what we can. What we are able to offer at any particular

227
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:58,920
time is enough. And in turn, we are able to share in the contributions of others. Maybe

228
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:06,800
even, I hope, some of us who have been around will be more inclined to give people who are

229
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:13,800
over committing the gift of reminding of that, hey, it's enough. You can take it easy. And

230
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,720
this is particularly important. I think the mindset of this kind of gift giving community

231
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,720
may also help us be more willing to share the load, to respect what others are bringing

232
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:36,680
and to give the gift of allowing others to take on the tasks that we've been doing.

233
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:43,680
As I said earlier, rejecting someone's gift shows a lack of respect. By rejecting a gift,

234
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,680
we say we don't want them to be part of the community. So keeping that in mind, I think

235
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,960
we want to be sure that there are ways for new and different people to contribute, to

236
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,840
give their gifts. And in turn, we need to give them the gift of mentoring and guidance

237
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,960
so that they can.

238
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,960
Now, part of this is the need to hand off leadership generously, to share positions

239
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:16,360
of leadership. And this is something that benefits the giver as well as the receiver.

240
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:23,360
I am pretty sure that one reason I've been able to stay active and involved in this is

241
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:31,280
that I have had a very deliberate policy to hand off the leadership of any project I've

242
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:40,760
ended up leading to new people after three to five years.

243
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,480
In fact, here's the pro tip. If you're in a position of leadership and you're wondering

244
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,520
about when you should start thinking about training and finding a successor, the answer

245
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,320
is the first day that you are in that position of leadership is when you should start thinking

246
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:03,320
about that. It's really easy then. We need succession planning. It is not easy at first.

247
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:13,160
It feels like a loss, but it isn't. It helps the new people grow and it keeps the experienced

248
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,760
people fresh because you can then go on and do something else. You don't have to just

249
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:25,760
sit. So I recommend this very highly.

250
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:33,760
The other area where I think a sense of clarity about what makes our community work is really

251
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:42,920
important is when it comes to money. So far I have deliberately not mentioned the dominant

252
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:50,920
form we have of sharing resources, which is a market economy with exchanges based on money.

253
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:56,360
I could go on and on about what a wonderful scam money is. It can be imaginary as long

254
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,640
as we all believe in it and everybody in the world seems to believe in it. It's the one

255
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,840
article of faith we all share. Then money works. But let's not go there.

256
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:13,840
The thing about money is it has a tendency towards exact transactions, the exact opposite

257
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:21,280
of the messiness you get with gift-giving cultures. That means, in fact, it works against

258
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:29,080
connection and community. If you give me something worth $2.52 and I in turn give you $2.52,

259
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:37,080
we both know we're exactly even, the transaction is done. There is no need to continue any

260
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:46,640
relationship. Transactions don't build community. For that reason, particularly as a community,

261
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,360
I think we need to be very, very thoughtful about how we deal with money.

262
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:02,520
I am not naive. In this world, we pretty much all need money. I can testify it's better

263
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:09,520
to have a bit more of it than not to have enough of it. That's true for us as individuals.

264
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:17,240
It's true for our communities and the PSF. It's just true in general.

265
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:24,560
Certainly when we, as say the PSF, ask people to make helping our community a full-time

266
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:32,320
job, whether that's managing our community events or our infrastructure or our coding

267
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,360
process, or whatever it might be, those people deserve to be paid fairly, actually I would

268
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:44,360
say generously. We also want to make our communities, our events more inclusive. That means that

269
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:52,000
many people will need financial help to take part. If we want to foster communities around

270
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,800
the world, that also takes money. I think we know that for many, many reasons these

271
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:03,320
days that is going to take even more money than it has before. We clearly need financial

272
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:08,560
resources for the community, for the PSF, for our meetups, for lots of things in order

273
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:15,560
to grow and flourish. What I worry about is the notion that we should make monetary exchange

274
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:22,560
the driver of either the way we get financial resources or the way we share them. Let me

275
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,560
explain a little bit what I mean by that. What I mean by that is that when we go about

276
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:34,560
raising money and using money for the community, we need to be very careful, very wary. We

277
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:41,800
need to avoid becoming quote, a business. I don't have anything at all. I don't have

278
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,040
anything at all against business, mind you. I have made a living working for businesses

279
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:57,040
and helping them succeed. I certainly appreciate the support that businesses have given our

280
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:04,600
community. That's not what I'm saying. I would argue against our Python communities, the

281
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,720
PSF, ever acting like a business. I worked for various companies over the past 35 years

282
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,720
and no matter what HR or marketing would like you to believe, being an employee is not being

283
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,720
in a community of shared contribution with your employer, at least not in the companies

284
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:30,720
I've seen, nor is being a customer being in a shared community of contribution. If our

285
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:39,760
contributors become employees and our sponsors become customers, if we become a business,

286
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,320
I believe our community will be diminished, if not destroyed. Now, I admit that I am biased,

287
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:55,720
but I think so far the PSF and the Python community have handled this well. The PSF

288
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,420
has hired people to support the development of the community, to help enable people to

289
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:08,220
contribute more successfully across all the areas. There's been money spent supporting

290
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:15,220
smaller regional and local groups and helping those communities grow and contribute. And

291
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:24,140
there's been financial aid for PyCon and other conferences that has helped people who otherwise

292
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:31,140
wouldn't be able to join and make contributions at this level. In addition, so far I think

293
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:38,140
the model of sponsorship that's been developed is for support for the PSF generally without

294
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:46,080
corporate strings attached. And I believe this is the right strategy. As we interact

295
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:53,080
with the business world, we should not, as a Python community, as the PSF, and so on,

296
00:34:54,140 --> 00:35:00,360
try to become a business. And there is a temptation for that. People have suggested things that

297
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,560
start to go in that direction. We should not become a business, but rather we should

298
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:12,560
invite those enterprises to join in our world of free contribution. Now, that does mean

299
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:20,200
selling those businesses on hard to quantify intangible benefits, and that's a tough sell,

300
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,960
but it's not impossible, and I think it's worth it. I think it is the way to go. The

301
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:33,960
thing is, we're still in the early days. As late stage capitalism becomes harsher, which

302
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:41,320
I bet it will, as Python's importance and Big Tech's power both continue to grow, I

303
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:49,760
think that the tension between the market economy around us and a community centered

304
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,760
around gifts is going to grow. In other words, I think it's pretty inevitable that the market

305
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,460
economy will be more vulnerable, that there will be more pressure on us to abandon our

306
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:08,460
culture of gifts and free contributions in favor of transactions. I mean, it could be

307
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,800
companies trying to buy control over the language and or the community. It could be pressure

308
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,800
from various sources to treat our contributors and volunteers more like employees. It could

309
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,280
be any number of things. There are so many possibilities that I can't begin to suggest

310
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,840
what it might be, but in the coming years, I am pretty sure that there will be many,

311
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:42,840
many opportunities to sell out our community for one tempting offer or another. If and

312
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:51,360
when that happens, it will be up to us to decide whether we still want this community

313
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:57,600
to be a place of free contribution and a time of gifts. I, for one, already know my

314
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,360
answer. Thank you very much. It's been a pleasure.
