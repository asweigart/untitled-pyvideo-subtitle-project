1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,560
And now let's welcome Thomas Waters to the stage to kick off our PSF update.

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,020
So some of you may have seen me this morning on stage for the steering council.

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,020
This is not that.

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,020
This is a different hat.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:27,220
I'm also the vice chair of the board of directors of the PSF and I have been for the last half

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:36,380
year the interim general manager since Eva Jodlowska left the PSF last year.

7
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,400
I'm sure a lot of you have heard of Eva.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,720
She ran PyCon for 14 years.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,700
She ran the PSF for 10.

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:53,060
Grew the PSF from a small volunteer led organization with one staff member to a multi-million dollar

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:01:02,780
foundation with seven staff members, two full-time contractors and a bunch more.

12
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:10,260
Sorry, technical difficulties.

13
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,980
And I just want to say, yes, thank you.

14
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:24,780
I just want to say on behalf of everyone, thank you, Eva, for all your hard work.

15
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:37,980
Many, many years of service.

16
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,260
Unfortunately she couldn't be here.

17
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,960
I know she'll be watching the recording so I just want to make sure we absolutely how

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,600
grateful we are for all our work.

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,160
After Eva left, she took great care to make sure that the foundation would keep running

20
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,920
without her.

21
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,660
I took on the general manager position just to make sure the staff had everything they

22
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:07,040
needed but it was the staff who did all the work and they have been amazing so thank you

23
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,200
to the staff as well.

24
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,960
And the board of directors set up a search committee to find the next executive director.

25
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,320
We talked to a lot of the community members, a lot of whom told us who they thought should

26
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,980
be the next executive director.

27
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,240
We took that in but we also hired a search firm.

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,200
We looked at a lot of left field candidates, at different people at different places in

29
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,460
the industry and then we ended up with several really good candidates that we had good conversations

30
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:43,180
with and in the end we hired one of the people that a lot of community members had been telling

31
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,240
us to hire from the start.

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,740
But at least we know we made the right decision.

33
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,980
I am entirely confident of that because we did our due diligence.

34
00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:01,460
So Deb Nicholson, a Python community member and someone with a large wealth of experience

35
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,020
and knowledge of the open source community.

36
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,020
So welcome Deb.

37
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,420
Thank you.

38
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,420
Thank you.

39
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,420
Thank you.

40
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,420
Thank you.

41
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,420
All right.

42
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,420
Hello, PyCon.

43
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,420
I am your new executive director.

44
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,420
I want to thank Thomas for that lovely introduction.

45
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,140
He just made it sound like he showed up to a couple extra meetings but he actually acted

46
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:36,100
as a staff person for months with no pay and then also really helped me find out where

47
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,420
everything was and what meetings I should be at and who I needed to speak to.

48
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,420
So he did a fantastic job.

49
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,420
He might not like this but can we please give him a round of applause?

50
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,420
Thank you.

51
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,420
Thank you.

52
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,420
Thank you.

53
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,420
Thank you.

54
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,420
So it is really nice to see the top halves of your faces.

55
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,420
It has been a really weird ride.

56
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,420
I guess everyone says that, right?

57
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:10,420
But I want to really thank everyone for making this a great, safe, welcoming place to come

58
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,420
back at the tail end of, I am hoping tail end of a pandemic.

59
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:20,420
So thanks for being here and thanks for making it feel like a safe place for everyone to be.

60
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,420
And I want to also say hello to everyone who is participating remotely.

61
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,420
I am told that there is about 600 people that are watching the live streams.

62
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,420
So maybe they probably don't know that we know they are out there.

63
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,420
Could we just kind of like hello.

64
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,420
Thank you for watching.

65
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:42,420
I would love to see if we could make the hybrid version of the event a little bit more fun.

66
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,420
So we will talk about that in the future.

67
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,420
I also want to say a huge thank you to Emily Morehouse, PyCon's volunteer conference chair.

68
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,420
She signed up to do PyCon for two years.

69
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,420
She did two remote years and then a third as we came back here.

70
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,420
She worked with all of our keynotes.

71
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,420
She set the program.

72
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,420
And as many of you probably have already noticed, she has been acting as our emcee.

73
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,420
So thank you for being here.

74
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,420
Thank you for being here.

75
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,420
Thank you for being here.

76
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,420
So as many of you probably have already noticed, she has been acting as our emcee.

77
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,420
So thank you so much to Emily Morehouse for three years of conference chair.

78
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:24,420
So I am the executive director of the Python Software Foundation.

79
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,420
How many people know what the Python Software Foundation is?

80
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,420
I see most hands.

81
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,420
Well, maybe half.

82
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,420
Okay.

83
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,420
We are going to do maybe the Tencent tour.

84
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,420
First of all, we put on PyCon, which you are at.

85
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,420
So obviously that is great.

86
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,420
I don't know if you know that we do this usually with eight staff.

87
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,420
And this year with seven because I only joined three weeks ago.

88
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:56,420
So we have seven very tired staff members here that put on this entire event with volunteers and vendors and everything else.

89
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,420
So I just want to say thank you to them also.

90
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,420
They have done so much work.

91
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,420
Like just hours and hours and hours.

92
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,420
And it is just so amazing.

93
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,420
And I can't touch the mic.

94
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:12,420
The Python Software is also the nonprofit vendor neutral home for Python.

95
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:20,420
It is what enables Python to stay an open source community that is driven by the community and for the community.

96
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:30,420
And that lets us behave as an organization that can take patches from anyone, can take suggestions from anyone, and can take contributions from anyone.

97
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:36,420
And I think that that is so important and completely different than the way a lot of other software gets written.

98
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,420
So that is one of the other things we do.

99
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:44,420
We also provide all the support and infrastructure for the Python programming language.

100
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,420
We also pay some very excellent people to work on Python.

101
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,420
Probably a lot of you saw Lukasz's keynote earlier.

102
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,420
He is our developer in residence and works on CPython.

103
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,420
And is also working on optimizing our volunteer contributions.

104
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:04,420
The other person who we pay to work on Python is Shemeika Monahan who is our packaging manager.

105
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:10,420
She wanted me to let you know that we are working on a grand vision for packaging.

106
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,420
And we are going to be seeking input from the community within the next month or so.

107
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:20,420
So I hope you will keep an eye out for that survey and request for information and feedback from Shemeika.

108
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,420
The other thing we do is we give money away.

109
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,420
Which is super fun.

110
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,420
We gave $117,000 away this year which is kind of awesome.

111
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:36,420
It is a little less than in previous years because of the pandemic.

112
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:48,420
But another thing I would love is if you know of an amazing Python project or community or initiative that could use some money that you tell them that the PSF can help them with that.

113
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,420
So how do we do all this?

114
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,420
The short answer is you.

115
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,420
But the long answer is also you.

116
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:06,420
Basically we are able to do all this because you in your lives and in your communities and at your workplace talk about Python.

117
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,420
You help other people learn Python.

118
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,420
You get us in front of your boss who writes a check to the PSF.

119
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,420
Also very important.

120
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,420
And so that is how we do this.

121
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,420
We could not do this without all of you.

122
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,420
This is our brand new annual report.

123
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,420
Take a picture.

124
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,420
It is many pages.

125
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,420
You are not going to want to read it this minute.

126
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,420
But it is beautiful.

127
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,420
It lays out in detail everything that we accomplished over the last year or so.

128
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,420
Or you can just take my word for it that we are awesome.

129
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,420
This is the fundraiser.

130
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,420
You can just give us more money.

131
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,420
Unless you already have.

132
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,420
Or you can give twice.

133
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,420
You are allowed.

134
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:54,420
If you have ideas on how we could get in touch with your boss to give more money, let us know.

135
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:00,420
So that brings me to the community service awards.

136
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,420
Let's see.

137
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,420
We have three years of backlog of community service awards.

138
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,420
Because we haven't met for a long time.

139
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:16,420
I am going to go a little faster than I might have liked to if you are doing one year.

140
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,420
Because I want you all to be able to get to Sprint tomorrow.

141
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,420
Let's talk about the community service awards.

142
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,420
I am going to do first the folks who are not here with us in person.

143
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,420
And then bring up the folks who are here with us in person on stage for each year.

144
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,420
The 2019 winners, I want to thank Chris Angelico,

145
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:44,420
Filippo de Morais, Jessica Upani, Manny Young, Katie Bell, Lillian Ryan and Mark Sapiro for their service to the community.

146
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,420
And then I also want to bring up Deborah Azevedo.

147
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,420
If she is here.

148
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,420
So, Deborah is amazing.

149
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,420
She does a lot of work with Pi Brazil and does a lot of work with Pi Lady.

150
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,420
She spoke with Charles this weekend.

151
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,420
She is an amazing, engaging presenter and participates in a ton of community services.

152
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,420
And she is a great host.

153
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,420
I want to thank her for her work.

154
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,420
I want to thank her for her work.

155
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,420
She has been an amazing host.

156
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
She has been a great host.

157
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,420
And I want to thank her for her work.

158
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,420
And then I also want to thank the people who have been there.

159
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,420
She is an amazing presenter and participates in a ton of community events.

160
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,420
So, thank you, Deborah, for your service to the Python community.

161
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,420
Yay!

162
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,420
Our 2020 winners.

163
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,420
It's just like the whole year took place in 10 minutes.

164
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,420
Or the whole two years.

165
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,420
Three years.

166
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,420
We have a lot of winners.

167
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,420
Abigail Dogby.

168
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,420
Katia Lira.

169
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,420
Noah Aluru.

170
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,420
Rami Chaudhary.

We have a lot of winners.

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,420

And then finally, I want to bring up two folks from PyCon Japan, the PyCon JP Association, for their work organizing local and regional PyCons, the work of monitoring our trademarks, and in particular, organizing the PyCon JP charity talks raising more than $25,000 U.S. in funds for the PSF.

210
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,420
Thank you so much.

211
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,420
Suzuki and Manabu, please come up.

212
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:48,420
Thank you so much for your service to the PyCon community.

213
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:56,420
Thank you.

214
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,420
Okay.

215
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,420
And you can read more about our amazing community service award winners here and how to nominate more people.

216
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,420
If you know someone who is doing awesome work, we want to hear about them.

217
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,420
We want to have them come up on stage and we want to recognize their amazing contributions.

218
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,420
So I just want to finish with a puppy.

219
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,420
This isn't mine.

220
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,420
A few years ago, a friend of mine got a puppy.

221
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,420
And maybe two or three days later, he said to me, I was completely surprised by how quickly I fell in love with a dog.

222
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,420
And he said, I'm just so happy.

223
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,420
I'm so happy.

224
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,420
I'm so happy.

225
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,420
I'm so happy.

226
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,420
I'm so happy.

227
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,420
I'm so happy.

228
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,420
I'm so happy.

229
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,420
I'm so happy.

230
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,420
And he said, I'm just so happy that I get to take care of this little guy.

231
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,420
And I don't know why he was surprised.

232
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,420
Because puppies are pretty darn great.

233
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,420
Right?

234
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,420
Anyway, I'm telling you this because everyone here, the staff at the PSF, the amazing volunteers, and all of you here at PyCon have been so amazing.

235
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,420
Welcoming, passionate.

236
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,420
Seriously, folks have gone out of their way to share their stories and their opinions and community history with me.

237
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,420
I'm saying that you all are the puppy.

238
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,420
I'm saying that you all are the puppy.

239
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,420
I'm saying that you all are the puppy.

240
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,420
I'm saying that you all are the puppy.

241
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,420
I'm saying that you all are the puppy.

242
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,420
I'm saying that you all are the puppy.

243
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,420
I'm saying that you all are the puppy.

244
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,420
I'm saying that you all are the puppy.

245
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,420
The puppy that I didn't expect to love immediately, but here we are.

246
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,420
And I am so happy that I get to take care of the Python community with you.

247
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,420
And I am so happy that I get to take care of the Python community with you.

248
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,420
I want to hear all your ideas, so please get in touch.

249
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,420
And I'm glad that you're here at PyCon.

250
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,420
And I hope to see you again next year.
