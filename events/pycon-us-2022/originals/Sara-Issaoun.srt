1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,760
And now I am thrilled to introduce Sarah Issaoun, member of the Event Horizon

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,600
Telescope collaboration, an Einstein Fellow.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:55,800
Thank you.

4
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:08,760
Hello. I'm really nervous. This is my first talk since before the pandemic, so

5
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,760
in person. So bear with me. My name is Sarah. I'm a member of the Event Horizon

6
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,560
Telescope collaboration. I'm here to tell you about how we managed to make an

7
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,160
image of a black hole. You're probably familiar with our famous image from 2019.

8
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,640
This image here, this is the image of the black hole in the galaxy M87. It's

9
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,480
55 million light-years away from us. And I want to tell you a little bit about

10
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,080
our journey to get to this image. What we've learned since then about this

11
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,920
black hole, because we've had results last year that came out about this black

12
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,600
hole, and also the role that software development actually plays in big

13
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,000
science like our project. So one thing that was really shocking when we

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,040
released the image was that it actually went on front pages of newspapers around

15
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,880
the world. This is not something that happens to science results. This is

16
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,560
really not... People don't like to talk about... I mean it's like on page 12 or

17
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,160
something in a newspaper if it makes the news. But to see it on front pages the

18
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,160
day after we made this result really made us understand that we were giving

19
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,740
the world something special, something they could be part of, something that

20
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,840
shows that science is bigger than just one person. It's about collaboration,

21
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,760
it's about teamwork, it's about overcoming differences in cultures, in

22
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:37,280
countries, in career stages, gender, age, etc., and actually come together for one

23
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:46,760
goal and be able to be part of this moment. And this particular event, seeing

24
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,800
it on front pages, was really a shock to us. We knew some people would be

25
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,720
interested in this image but we didn't know really the response that the public

26
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,800
would have. One thing we also did not know is that the public would come up

27
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,760
with a lot of memes. And this was really interesting because we were trending

28
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,080
number one on Twitter. Like that doesn't happen to science results. So we

29
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,840
actually understood that as a collaboration it was our job to make sure

30
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,120
that you're all part of our story, that you understand that you're part of

31
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,360
science, you're part of progress, you're part of this big community that makes

32
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,160
the world a little bit better, a little bit funnier, a little bit more joyous.

33
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,240
So I'm just a member of the collaboration. I only play a small part,

34
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,200
we all play a small part in this big story. The Event Horizon Telescope

35
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,560
collaboration is 300 plus members, we're across over 60 institutes, 18 countries

36
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,880
and regions in Europe, Asia, Africa, North and South America. We're a really diverse

37
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,160
group of people, we're not all astronomers, they're software developers,

38
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,320
they're computer scientists, they're engineers, they're telescope operators,

39
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,600
administrators, all being part of this story, all playing their important part

40
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,960
in making this project happen. And I only play a very small part and I get to

41
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,640
represent all of these amazing people I get to work with today.

42
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,360
So hopefully this plays... So if you go...

43
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,960
Just a little bit slow. If you look up in the night sky,

44
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,080
there's a constellation called the Virgo constellation. In this constellation,

45
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,560
there's a bright dot that is the galaxy M87. This galaxy is 55 million light years

46
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,880
away from us, that's very far. And if you look at it with optical telescopes

47
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,120
like the Hubble Telescope, you will see the streak of matter, of gas that

48
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,080
comes from it. What is that? If you actually chase this streak down,

49
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,920
you look at it in the radio waves because radio waves allow you to peer

50
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,480
through the entire galaxy. You follow it with better and better telescopes

51
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,120
all the way down to its core. You find what we found with the

52
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,840
Event Horizon Telescope, the supermassive black hole. This streak of gas is

53
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,040
emitted by this black hole. This black hole is incredibly tiny compared to

54
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,920
the size of the galaxy and yet it creates a jet of plasma that

55
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,840
pierces through its entire galaxy and even its galactic neighborhood.

56
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,520
This immense power is kind of incredible and it's something we don't

57
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,400
quite understand. This is the most powerful process in the universe,

58
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,640
how black holes power their jets. And we don't understand how these happen.

59
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,520
Seeing a black hole up close with the Event Horizon Telescope allows us

60
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,600
to make the connection between what happens near a black hole and what happens

61
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,440
throughout its entire galaxy. So this is our goal with the EHT,

62
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,320
to understand how black holes look, how they feed, how they eject these

63
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,440
powerful jet of matter and how these jets also affect their nearby galaxies.

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,560
So we want to see the M87 black hole. It's very far away.

65
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,080
Its predicted size on the sky is about 20 to 40 microseconds. That's the

66
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,160
size of about a doughnut on the surface of the moon as seen from here.

67
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,480
So telescope size is proportional to observing wavelengths, the wavelengths

68
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,880
which we are looking with the telescope, and angular resolution of the telescope,

69
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,400
so the size of the telescope.

70
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,640
So the angular resolution we need to see M87 is 20 microseconds,

71
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,920
based on the predicted size. The observing wavelengths we need to peer

72
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,200
through all of the gas between us and the galaxy is one millimeter wavelength.

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,320
This is what we call the Goldilocks wavelength, to peer through all of

74
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,440
the gas, but that we're able to observe using Earth telescopes.

75
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,320
And it's also in the radio, and radio waves are not bothered by anything

76
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,200
between us and the black hole. So if we make this calculation,

77
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,040
what is the telescope size we get to see M87? It's actually 13 million meters.

78
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,200
Unfortunately, we tried, but no science agency wanted to fund building a

79
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,800
telescope this big, so we ended up with the next best thing,

80
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,600
which is actually right below our feet, the Earth.

81
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,960
The Earth's diameter is 13 million meters, and we can use the Earth as our telescope.

82
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,000
So how do we do that? We use a technique called very long baseline interferometry.

83
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,120
We find telescopes around the Earth that would form fragments of our telescope

84
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,480
mirror, and then we synthesize a virtual telescope the size of the Earth.

85
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,960
This is what we do.

86
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,560
Now, in order to do that, it's actually quite a challenging technique that won

87
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,160
the Nobel Prize in the 70s in physics, and I'll try to explain briefly how we do that.

88
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,480
So we have the black hole, it emits radio waves that's very far away.

89
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,360
The waves that it emits arrive as plane waves on Earth, so they're flat.

90
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,080
Now, the Earth is curved. I hope you all know that.

91
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,840
Because of that, telescopes that are at large distances from each other,

92
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,400
they actually see a signal at different times.

93
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,800
So if you look at this picture, the telescope at the bottom actually sees

94
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,400
one of the straight lines earlier than the telescope at the top.

95
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,440
Now, the Earth's curvature actually causes a problem because we need to see the

96
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,360
signal from the black hole at the exact same time at each telescope in order to

97
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,720
reconstruct an image. Each telescope has to see the same signal so that we can

98
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,920
correlate the signal and make an image.

99
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,640
Now, how do we get by this problem? So we have different telescopes at different

100
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,000
sites. The distances between each telescope is what we call the baseline

101
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,400
distance. Each pair of telescopes gives us a part of the image. So telescopes

102
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,040
close together, they tell us about large scale structure in the image because they

103
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,560
see more signal in common. Telescopes further apart see less signal in common,

104
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,360
and they tell us about smaller scale structure. So we need many telescopes at

105
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,880
different distances and different orientations on the Earth to reconstruct

106
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,680
all the information that is on the image. Then we have this time difference that

107
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,880
we have to deal with, and this time difference needs to be taken into account.

108
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,720
So what we use is extremely accurate clocks. They're called maser clocks,

109
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,840
and they are so accurate, they lose about a second every 100 million years.

110
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,840
That's how accurate these clocks are. So these clocks at each telescope,

111
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,600
they're about the size of a mini fridge. They're expensive, but they work.

112
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,520
And so these clocks help us time tag the arrival of the signal at each telescope,

113
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,160
and then we record that signal onto hard drives. So essentially,

114
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,600
every piece of light that arrives at the telescope is time tagged and then frozen

115
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,160
into hard drives. And then we play it back at a separate time later when we

116
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,680
combine all the signals from all the telescopes, all the hard drives.

117
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,960
So this is what very long baseline interferometry is, and this is how the

118
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,840
EHT is made. So the progress to getting the Event Horizon Telescope was a really

119
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:04,480
long one. The first dishes of the EHT started in 2007, and then we had more

120
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,480
and more as the years go by. Some telescopes were lost,

121
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:14,280
unfortunately they were decommissioned, and others joined until we reached 2017.

122
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,520
This is the year we finally had enough telescopes, enough combinations of these

123
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,840
different baselines that we were able to reconstruct an image.

124
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,040
We had six different locations, six single dish telescopes, and two phaser rays.

125
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,120
Phaser rays are basically telescopes in one place that can be combined into the

126
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,040
same way we do with the EHT, into a bigger virtual telescope that gives us

127
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,880
more sensitivity at that site. So we had eight telescopes for our observations.

128
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,160
The South Pole Telescope did not take part in the M87 results because it's in

129
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,080
the southern hemisphere and M87 is actually a northern hemisphere source,

130
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,120
so the South Pole cannot see it. Now you'll notice all these telescopes look

131
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,560
completely different from each other. The reason for that is because we didn't

132
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,960
build them. We borrowed them. We happened to just find telescopes that can observe

133
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,320
at the wavelengths we need that happen to be at high and dry enough sites such

134
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,440
that the atmosphere and the water vapor in the atmosphere that can scramble and

135
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,880
destroy our signal doesn't affect us as much. So these telescopes all are in the

136
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,680
most extreme locations on the planet, the driest deserts, the highest mountains,

137
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,520
and they were built for completely different science. They were built for

138
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,440
standalone science. This is why they all have different designs, different looks,

139
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,080
but they have one thing in common. Actually, two things in common, the clock,

140
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:46,600
the mini fridge that we have, and this. Wait, one more thing. I forgot I added

141
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:53,280
this slide. Another thing is we don't observe alone with the EHT. So we've told

142
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,640
this story that we have all these telescopes on Earth that we combine. We

143
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,040
also observe together with other telescopes that observe at different

144
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,320
wavelengths. So there are lots of telescopes that combined with us can

145
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,480
teach us a lot more about the black hole. Not only do we have the black hole image,

146
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,640
but we also know what the black hole is doing across the electromagnetic spectrum

147
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,920
at the same time. And this is something incredible that goes beyond our

148
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,560
collaboration because it also involves collaborating with multi wavelength

149
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,600
partners with other telescopes, other collaborations to come together at this

150
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,240
exact time and all look at the same thing. And this is really incredible. And

151
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,640
one of the big results that came out last year is this. This is what M87 looks

152
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,880
like across the electromagnetic spectrum. So you know our famous image,

153
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,200
which is down there. In yellow, there's kind of all what it looks like in the

154
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,000
radio where we see this jet of plasma. And then we have views of it in the X

155
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,800
ray. In the optical, you see the nice Hubble image, which is HST here at the

156
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,800
bottom one of the middle row. And then also what it looks like in the high

157
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:10,400
energy and X ray. And this view of M87 during our 2017 campaign was really

158
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,160
important in understanding the physics of the black hole, how it ejects this jet

159
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:22,400
of matter and how it varies with time. Now, as I mentioned, all our telescopes

160
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,600
are completely different. They have two things in common, our mini fridge and

161
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,360
this on the right here. This is what we call our EHT backend. It's our recording

162
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,560
equipment. This big block of things is what records our data. So we have a

163
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,160
telescope that has a receiver on it. The receiver receives the signal. It goes

164
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,960
through some wires and then it gets down converted to a lower frequency so that

165
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,320
we can measure it. We digitize it because we measure an analog signal. It needs to

166
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,480
be digitized into a two-bit sampling signal. And then we record it onto our

167
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,040
hard drives. Each of these little boxes here is called a module. Each module has

168
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,240
about eight stacked hard drives. We recorded on 736 hard drives during our

169
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,280
entire campaign. We recorded about three and a half petabytes of data across our

170
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:18,400
entire campaign. About one petabyte of that is M87. During our campaign, we

171
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:24,200
observe in April of each year, March, April. This is because weather is a big

172
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:30,240
part of our observing. As I mentioned, water vapor, atmospheric turbulence

173
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,760
destroys our signal. So we need really good weather. And so how do we do that

174
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,800
We try to find the best time window in which we have the most consistent, decent

175
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,440
weather for half the planet, which is very hard to do. And during the campaign,

176
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,480
we have a set window of days to observe, about 12 days. And we pay very close

177
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,240
attention to the weather and technical operations with our VLBI monitor to make

178
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,840
sure we make the right decision. On each day, we make a go or no-go decision. And

179
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:09,120
so mere hours before observing, that is when we decide to go on sky. So our

180
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,120
operations, our telescope staff have to be on it at each time and be ready to

181
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,720
observe if we trigger. And there are multitudes of reasons why we trigger on

182
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,600
certain days. Parts of it also comes from our multi-wavelength partners. For

183
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,160
example, if X-ray observatories are observing at the same time, like the Chandra

184
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,920
Observatory, then those are more likely days for us to observe. And then, of

185
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,160
course, the weather and telescope operations play a major part. So in our

186
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,640
2017 campaign, across our 12 days, which triggered five days of observation, and

187
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:55,760
four of those had M87. So this is a nice picture of the 2017 observations as all

188
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,320
the different telescope staff and observers that were at the telescopes

189
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,440
during the campaign. You'll see everybody's happy faces. We're normally

190
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,920
not that happy. It's high altitude and we don't sleep much. It's very tiring. But

191
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,520
we're happy for photo ops. And so in the top right corner, you'll notice there's a

192
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,760
woman in that picture. That's me. I was at the 7-millimeter telescope in Arizona

193
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,520
during the observations. This is one of the central telescopes. So I had sometimes,

194
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,240
you know, 30 to 35 hours without sleep. So that's fun. But it seems it was worth

195
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:39,760
it. So I think we're okay. So after the observations, we pack up our modules,

196
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:46,000
our hard drives, and ship them to this guy. This guy is Don Sosa. He is our

197
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,040
shipping expert for the EHT. Every single package of EHT, data, equipment, goes

198
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,080
through him. And he used to be a police officer for the state of Massachusetts.

199
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,960
And now he's in charge of all our shipping. And he's never lost a single

200
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:07,040
package since he's been doing this job. We had one mishap in which we

201
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,640
thought we had South Pole Telescope hard drives, but it ended up being a bunch of

202
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:18,240
silk. But, you know, everything was solved and we got our hard drives back

203
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,840
and the silk went back to where it belonged, luckily. On the left here are

204
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,520
filled modules. You'll notice they have green stickers, whereas the ones in the

205
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,800
big box I showed you had, they have red stickers and the ones in the big box had

206
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,840
green stickers. Green stickers means modules are empty. Red stickers means

207
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,080
modules are filled. So all of these modules have our precious data. What

208
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,280
happens to them? They get shipped half to one place and half to another. So I want

209
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,040
to talk a little bit about the data reduction process of the EHT. So we

210
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:59,080
measure petabytes of signal at the telescopes. Part of that signal is what

211
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,520
telescopes can see in common. So at the correlation stage, where we correlate the

212
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,540
signal between telescopes, we end up with terabytes of data. So we only keep the

213
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:14,040
signal that the telescopes see in common. Then we undergo a calibration stage in

214
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:20,280
which we reduce the data by solving for a bunch of processes and atmospheric

215
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,400
effects that scramble our data to unscramble it so that we can average

216
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,960
down. Just like constructive or destructive interference, right? If you

217
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,560
have destructive interference, you average it down, you destroy your signal.

218
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,840
If you have constructive interference, you can build your signal. So our goal is

219
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:42,080
to have constructive interference, build signal, and get higher sensitivity in our

220
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,440
data. And this is what happens in the calibration stage, and then we're left

221
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,520
with megabytes of data files. These data files are what are used in imaging. And

222
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,240
then our final image is actually a few kilobytes. You can send it on your phone.

223
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,400
And I always find this totally incredible that from the moment we measure the

224
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,800
signal to the kilobytes of data you can send on your phone, we undergo 12 orders

225
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:11,520
of magnitude in data reduction, which is kind of amazing. And this is the process

226
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,040
that happens in the EHT, and there isn't many experiments that go through this

227
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:23,280
amount of data crunching for their final result. Now, half the data go to Westford,

228
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,960
Massachusetts, an MIT Haystack Observatory, and the other half go to

229
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,480
Bonn, Germany at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy. These are our

230
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,320
correlation centers where they go onto these giant supercomputers that take into

231
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,040
account the earth's curvature, realign the signals, and make sure that they get

232
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:45,080
every combination of common signal between each pair of telescopes. So,

233
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,520
essentially, the correlators then create our virtual telescope. Then there's a long

234
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,960
process to understand the data. So, after correlation, the data go to a dedicated

235
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,440
team that builds pipelines. These pipelines correct for correlation errors.

236
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,560
They also correct for atmospheric effects, and they help build the signal,

237
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:09,160
like this constructive averaging. There are three pipelines that were built.

238
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,600
One is called hops, one is called CASA, one is called APES. Each of these

239
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:21,040
pipelines are supported by many Python packages. And, again, this step is one of

240
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,520
the most important steps of the entire process, because it requires really

241
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,480
understanding of the data, separating between what comes from our instrument and

242
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,800
the atmosphere, and what is the true black hole signal. Nothing, all the signs,

243
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:40,560
all the analysis after that really depends on this step, and this step is

244
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:47,080
Python supported. And then we go through a data validation by a dedicated team

245
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,360
where we compare all these independent pipelines, their outputs, making sure that

246
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,600
we understand that we're seeing the true black hole signal. And this data

247
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:02,160
validation also involves a whole bunch of suites of data tests that are, again,

248
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:09,440
supported by many Python packages. And this entire process was like a cycle of

249
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,800
about four or five times that we did this, from correlation all the way to data

250
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,320
validation, and this took one and a half years. So if people ask, you know,

251
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,720
why does it take so long for pictures of black holes, we observed in 2017,

252
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,920
one and a half years was spent on this. And then about half a year later,

253
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,080
we released the image. So it was a two-year process. And this part is

254
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,160
incredibly important. Understanding the data is one thing. The next step is

255
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,680
understanding of the telescopes. So we need to understand our telescopes with

256
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,520
incredible detail, such as the atmosphere, how our telescopes move, how they behave.

257
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,480
And as I mentioned, all our telescopes are different from each other.

258
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,160
So this is not a trivial thing. It requires really paying attention and

259
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,720
understanding each part of our instrument, and we don't really have a part that

260
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,440
repeats. So this was quite a lot of work. Another thing we have to do is, in order

261
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,400
to make images of polarization, which I'll explain later, we have to also

262
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,120
decouple leakage. So we observe in two polarizations, and we have signal that

263
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,320
sometimes leaks into the other. Because of that, unfortunately, the Earth's

264
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,400
rotation helps us again. Because the Earth rotates, the telescopes on the ground

265
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:32,480
don't move, but the source on the sky moves. And so by decoupling the signal

266
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,840
that changes over the sky compared to the one that stays put, we can actually

267
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,240
separate between what is the instrument and what is the source signal.

268
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,000
Then M87 is finally ready for analysis. This is what our data looks like.

269
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,600
As a radio astronomer, to me, this is the most beautiful figure I've ever seen.

270
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,800
And honestly, I like it more than the image. And not because it's map plot-lib.

271
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:10,040
So why is this so beautiful to me? If you look at the data, all the different

272
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:15,400
colors are different pairs of telescopes. And the x-axis tells us about the

273
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:21,360
baseline lengths. So short baselines see more signal in common, long baselines see

274
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,000
less signal in common. You'll notice we have this dashed curve on it that

275
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,160
represents a uniform ring. So if this was on the sky, we would see the dashed curve.

276
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,840
And to me, that's incredibly beautiful, because the uniform ring is a beautiful

277
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,240
mathematical concept. It has a analytic solution. It is a sync function.

278
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,600
And it looks like this beautiful bounce. And to see this in the data,

279
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,600
to see the data also make this beautiful bounce, actually tells us that we're

280
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:58,280
seeing probably one of the most beautiful and simple objects in the universe,

281
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:04,680
just a ring. And another interesting aspect is that at this baseline length,

282
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,600
there are two pairs of telescopes that see different things. And what this tells

283
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,800
us by looking at these two pairs is that there is a brightness distribution that

284
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,840
changes. So one part of the ring is brighter than the other. And this data

285
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,240
tells us that it's brighter on the bottom. So even without making an image,

286
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,640
I already know what it looks like. Isn't that amazing? Just looking at this one

287
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,680
plot, we already know it's a ring brighter on the bottom. But of course,

288
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:41,400
we have a lot of questions about whether we're seeing what we're truly seeing.

289
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,400
And our data are publicly available, so you can actually go and download it and

290
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,960
download our imaging pipelines and make your own M87 image. The next step is,

291
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,000
what is imaging? So we again use the Earth as our telescope. So aperture synthesis

292
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,840
is a process where the Earth's rotation helps us fill a virtual mirror in the

293
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,960
middle there. And we combine data on temporal and spatial scales. So as the

294
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,200
Earth rotates, more and more telescopes see M87. We have more and more pairs of

295
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,360
telescopes. So the data kind of form in our virtual mirror. And then we stack the

296
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,000
data in time. And then we see how our image improves as we add more and more

297
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,800
data. Now, how do we decide what we're looking at? So if we're looking at the

298
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,720
data, okay, we think there's a ring in there. We think it looks a certain way,

299
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,040
but does it really? Are there other combinations of images on the sky that

300
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,440
could give us the same thing? So we were thinking maybe we should use machine

301
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,960
learning or just let computers decide what we're looking at and not have a

302
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,160
human component because we have such an expectation to see what we want to see

303
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,200
that maybe we're biased in that way. So it turns out people have done tests of

304
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,680
computers trying to decide what they're looking at. For example, is it fried

305
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:06,520
chicken or poodle? Or is it blueberry muffin or chihuahua? Or is it a sloth or a

306
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,920
chocolate croissant? It turns out computers don't know the difference,

307
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,760
which is surprising because as a human, at first you might be taken aback and see

308
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,160
if similar images, but if you take a closer look, you start critical thinking

309
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,440
and actually making up the difference between these. So if you take a little bit

310
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,840
of time, you can tell the difference. Computers can't. And so we just said,

311
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,400
oh, computers struggle, so let's just have humans have it go. But we structured the

312
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:44,200
imaging process in a way that tried to minimize the human bias. So this is our

313
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,960
imaging process. So we have a data calibration stage, which I went through.

314
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,120
Then we went through the first step, which is blind imaging in independent teams.

315
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,080
Then we had a bunch of feedback on data quality in this process. And then we went

316
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,520
to step two, which is pipeline building per independent software. Again,

317
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:06,600
a lot of our pipelines are supported by Python packages in which we build synthetic

318
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,880
models where we have a truth image and then we validate our images based on how

319
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,440
well they fit the data, how consistent they are with other sources we observe,

320
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,600
and how robust the structure is. So in the first step, we divided the imaging group

321
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:28,360
into four independent teams. Two of them, teams one and two, were focused on newer

322
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,720
forward modeling techniques, and teams three and four were focused on more

323
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,440
traditional inverse modeling techniques. Each team were asked to blithely

324
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,480
reconstruct images, and this was in order to assess human bias. So we spent a period

325
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:48,400
of seven weeks in our teams not talking to the others. I was in team two,

326
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,760
and in this process, we were kind of worried because in team two,

327
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,920
we saw a ring pretty easily. And we were thinking, what if we're the only team that

328
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,800
saw a ring? What if only the newer techniques saw a ring because our team was focused

329
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,480
on newer techniques? So what if us and team one saw a ring but teams three and four

330
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,160
didn't? How do we reconcile these differences? How do we end up working together if we have

331
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,560
opposing views of what we're seeing? So in the excitement of seeing the first image

332
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,320
of a black hole, we also had a lot of doubt and a lot of worry about what our scientific

333
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:30,120
path was going forward. So seven weeks in agony, and then we met at a workshop in

334
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:37,520
Cambridge, Massachusetts, and we were asked to have one image per team to show. And we all sat

335
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,960
in this room, all quiet, and Katie Baumann, who was leading the comparisons of the images,

336
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:53,400
she put on the screen four images. And there they were. These are the first images of M87 we saw as

337
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:59,720
a collective in the collaboration. These four images from the four teams, as you can see,

338
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,560
you know, they're a little bit rough on the edges. They were the first try, but they have

339
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:11,360
huge similarities. Every image gets a ring of the same size, and every image is brighter on the

340
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:17,640
bottom. So this was incredibly exciting, and it led to one of the most exciting and probably one

341
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,880
of my favorite days in the EHT. We took a picture, we averaged all the images together, we put it on

342
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,960
the screen and we took a group photo. This is everybody who was there at the workshop, and there

343
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,320
were many people also joining us remotely in the imaging teams. And, you know, you can see everybody

344
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:39,400
smiling. We were so thrilled that we had finally captured the image of a black hole. And this was

345
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:46,880
in July 2018, so about a year before we revealed it to the world. And in that evening, of course,

346
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:54,320
we went drinking. It was super fun. We went to a bar, we had some drinks, we sang karaoke. You can

347
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:00,320
see there in the bottom left, in the middle there, that's me and Katie Bellman and other members of

348
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:07,400
the imaging team blasting and singing really loud Bohemian Rhapsody, karaoke classic. And it was a

349
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:13,840
lot of fun. And really, this is one of the most memorable days for me as part of this project. It

350
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:20,800
was incredible. So the next step is how do we convince the rest of the world that we're seeing

351
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:27,120
the right thing? So we have our imaging software. All of these imaging software have knobs to tune

352
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,520
to make a final image. And two of these software, the ones that were built for EHT, are on GitHub

353
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:41,440
and also supported by Python packages. So we decided to create synthetic data, so fake data,

354
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,240
in which we know the truth, the underlying truth image. So we wanted to pick the knobs that best

355
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,560
reproduced all four of these images. So these were designed such that they have similar data

356
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:59,400
that looks like our bounce ring pattern, but that the underlying image might not be a ring. So one

357
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:05,440
of them is, or two of them are rings, but two of them are not. So we tested thousands of imaging

358
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:14,320
parameters systematically to decide which is a ring or how well they reproduce all four of these

359
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:22,240
data. And then the best ones that reproduce the best images were used on M87. So these were the

360
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,280
final images by the three softwares. You'll notice that you can't tell by the differences. That's how

361
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:33,840
well we were able to reconstruct them. And in fact, the famous image that you've seen, the first

362
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,520
image of a black hole, is actually just the average of these three. But as I mentioned,

363
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:47,360
we observed M87 for four days, and this image is only the April 11th day. So here are the other

364
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:54,240
three. And these are all independent observations of the black hole, and they all give us a ring of

365
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,320
the same size brighter on the bottom. No significant changes are observed, and M87 is a supermassive

366
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,960
black hole, and the image should change very, very slowly in this time period, which is what we see.

367
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,720
We also have polarization images. These were released last year, about almost exactly a year

368
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,520
ago. And these polarization images have, you know, these streaks added to it that show us

369
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:27,520
the polarization pattern. So light around the black hole comes from electrons orbiting magnetic

370
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:34,240
fields. So there's magnetic fields that thread the disk where the black hole feeds, and then these

371
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,200
magnetic fields have electrons gyrating in them, and then these electrons produce light that is

372
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,960
polarized, which means it oscillates in a certain direction. And what these oscillations tell us

373
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,200
is that they can actually give us information about what the magnetic fields look like.

374
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,320
And what the magnetic fields look like tell us about how the black hole ejects this jet.

375
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:04,080
So what is a black hole? So, you know, you all know about, you know, rockets escape velocities,

376
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,440
and objects escape velocity on Earth is independent of its mass. A rocket has the same escape velocity

377
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,080
as a balloon to leave Earth. And Reverend John Mitchell in 1784, he asked this question,

378
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,960
how small does an object need to be to have an escape velocity faster than the speed of light?

379
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,040
So how compact would you need an object to be for a rocket to need the speed of light or higher to

380
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,560
leave its surface? And once the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light, even photons, even

381
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:39,680
light, is trapped and the star becomes dark. So this was first called the dark star, and this

382
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:47,280
concept evolved into the black hole. So in 1915, Albert Einstein published his general theory of

383
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,800
relativity. In this theory, he predicts that light is affected by gravity. So light bends around

384
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:59,440
massive objects. And then in 1916, Carl Schwarzschild in the trenches of World War I,

385
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:07,280
he derived the first non-trivial solution to this equation, which is the Schwarzschild black hole.

386
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,040
It predicts a singularity that depends on a certain radius, and this radius is

387
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,200
creates the event horizon in which light cannot escape. Now, a lot of decades of work have been

388
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,280
put into understanding what would black holes look like if they existed? What would it look

389
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:30,160
like to an observer? What would it look like from Earth? Then in 1979, Jean-Pierre Lumenez makes the

390
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,200
first simulated image of a black hole. His simulation looks like this, which looks a lot

391
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,040
like the interstellar image, by the way, so not so many progress in the space. But it's a very

392
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,200
interesting simulation, by the way, so not so many progress, you know, since 1979. And his

393
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,560
simulation was run on punch cards. You know, you remember punch card computers? And he painted

394
00:34:52,560 --> 00:35:00,080
the dots of the image by hand and took the negative. And to me, this is just such an incredible

395
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,480
story, you know, just the effort that went into the first simulated image of a black hole.

396
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,800
So it's that black hole simulations have gotten a lot more complicated. We, you know, this is all

397
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,880
just a simulation of a black hole. We have the black hole in the center, the gas around it,

398
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,920
we have this magnetic field that thread them, and these magnetic fields emit light and also eject

399
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:30,960
this jet of matter. And the black hole shadow is created by the gas illuminating this dark region

400
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,480
where light cannot escape. So the black hole actually lives inside this dark region. And

401
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,240
depending on the inclination, the viewing angle that we see this black hole and the gas around it,

402
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,880
the brightness distribution on the ring changes. So some part is brighter than the other,

403
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,960
depending on how we're looking at it. This is because if we're inclined, the light that moves

404
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,480
towards us appears boosted, it appears brighter than the light moving away from us. This is the

405
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:06,720
Doppler effect. So then the light around the black hole that comes from this gas

406
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,880
gets deflected by the black hole's gravity. So if you have a lot of light rays that get deflected

407
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:20,240
by the black hole, and then you look at it from a camera far away, what you see is that the black

408
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:26,880
hole deflects light rays further from the event horizon, and it kind of puffs up into this shadow.

409
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,040
And you have this shadow of the black hole and then this bright ring around it.

410
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,080
And this is the image of M87. This is what we see.

411
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:46,320
Then a lot of work went from our theory teams at the EHT to simulate the black hole image.

412
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,080
So make our simulation library based on lots and lots of different parameters of what it could be

413
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,480
around the black hole. These parameters change everything from how fast the black hole is spinning,

414
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,760
what is the gas like, what is the temperature of the gas, what are the magnetic fields, etc.

415
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:08,880
All of these processes are astrophysics related. But you'll notice all of these look pretty similar.

416
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,960
They have a dark patch in the center and a dark ring and a bright ring around it.

417
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,440
This is because what we see in our image is the pure effect of gravity.

418
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,680
No matter what fancy astrophysics you put around it, you will always see at the edge of a black

419
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,880
hole what we see. Dark patch in the center, bright ring around it. Because fundamentally,

420
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,240
what makes this happen, what is dominating the image, is gravity.

421
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,680
The polarized simulation library also looked at the astrophysics of the gas.

422
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,280
Here, actually, polarization helps us understand astrophysics in much more detail. Because

423
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,520
while our first image depended on gravity mostly, the polarization is not gravity related.

424
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,880
It's related to the magnetic field. And so our image last year taught us a whole lot more

425
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:10,320
about M87 and the gas around it. Then the next step is to measure the mass of a black hole.

426
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,400
So we had two measurements for the black hole from other experiments. They differed by a factor of

427
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,720
two. That's why we didn't know how big the black hole would be. We measured this with three different

428
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,480
techniques. I'm running out of time, so I'll just quickly go through this. We measured it directly

429
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,720
from the image. We also measured it using simple shapes. So just make a disk, make a hole in it,

430
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:40,400
move it around, and then kind of fit through all of the different combinations of moving these

431
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:48,240
disks and blurring them. And then find the size of the black hole through that, which you can see

432
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:55,520
how it converges to the solution. And then we also fitted individual frames of our simulations

433
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:01,840
to see which frames actually taught us about the black hole. In the EHT modeling software,

434
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,400
we used three different software libraries to model the mass and the size. All of them

435
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:13,600
supported by Python packages. One is an MCMC sampling framework. One is a genetic algorithm,

436
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:23,360
and one uses nested sampling. Then we measured the mass of the black hole. So the ultimate question

437
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:28,000
to life, the universe, and everything. What is the size of the M87 black hole shadow? Do you know

438
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:36,640
the answers to this question? It's 42! It's 42 micro arc seconds. That is the size of the M87

439
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:43,760
black hole shadow. And because the size of a black hole is proportional to its mass, we could measure

440
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:51,200
the mass of the black hole, which is six and a half billion times the mass of the sun. This is one of

441
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:58,000
the most massive supermassive black holes in our universe. What more did we learn from the M87

442
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,840
black hole? This is the polarization image. The polarization pattern are these kind of streaks

443
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:09,600
that form a spiral. The spiral polarization tells us that the magnetic fields around the black hole

444
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,240
are also spiral shaped. And they tell us that the magnetic fields are actually strong enough

445
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:22,800
and ordered enough to be able to launch the jet. And they also tell us that this process uses the

446
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,120
black hole's rotation. The black hole is spinning, and its black hole's rotation is

447
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,680
powering the magnetic fields and powering the jet. So that we learned last year.

448
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,840
The size of M87 in perspective, so there's the sun in the center, the orbit of Pluto,

449
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:44,000
Voyager 1, which is the furthest human-made object, is just reaching the edge of the shadow.

450
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,360
That's how big M87 is. So is Einstein right? That's one of the questions we always get.

451
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,520
So Einstein predicts the black hole's shadow to be fairly circular. There are other theories of

452
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,800
gravity that predict deviations from circularity. And so we found a circularity within 10%, which

453
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,160
means Einstein is right yet again. So what's next for the Event Horizon Telescope? Just a quick

454
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,960
overview about where we're going. The other black hole we looked at is Sagittarius A star.

455
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:21,040
It is the supermassive black hole at the center of our own Milky Way. And Sagittarius A star

456
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,200
has these stars that orbit it, this dark region. These stars are bright in the infrared. And in

457
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,160
fact, the orbits of these stars measure the mass of Sagittarius A star with great accuracy. So we

458
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,040
know exactly what Einstein's theory predicts for the size of this black hole shadow. Because of

459
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:44,160
this amazing research, which actually won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2020. Then we had,

460
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,920
you know, we've observed it in the radio. Unfortunately, because it's in our galaxy,

461
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,800
we have this big cloud of matter, of gas, that blurs our image. So at other frequencies,

462
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:02,560
we cannot see the shadow. But the EHT can. And actually on May 12th, the Event Horizon Telescope

463
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,760
is going to reveal groundbreaking new results about the Milky Way. So that's something to look

464
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,120
forward to. We're also growing with the EHT. We've added new telescopes over the years at

465
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:19,520
different locations. More telescopes means we fill our mirror. And we're hoping to add more and more

466
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,200
telescopes to improve and make sharper and sharper images. Another bigger project is the

467
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,240
Next Generation EHT, where we want to put lots and lots of smaller telescopes at different locations

468
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:35,920
in the earth to enhance the imaging capabilities that we have. And eventually we want to go to

469
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,560
space, because we don't want to be limited by the earth's atmosphere. We can go to higher observing

470
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:46,080
frequencies where the atmosphere doesn't stop us. We can have a faster filling of our mirror with

471
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:53,440
the orbiter going very fast around the earth. And also have higher resolution, because we get the

472
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,840
distances between the earth and space. And that's, you know, much longer time scale. Then finally,

473
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:05,280
I just want to close off by saying that really the Python community, the software developer

474
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,760
community, open source community has been a pillar of modern science. Not just for the Event Horizon

475
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,480
Telescope, but for big science projects in general. You save us a huge amount of time.

476
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:22,960
Because all our analysis packages, everything I've presented today, all our different pipelines are

477
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,480
key process of the scientific method. We need to cross-check each other. And in order to do that,

478
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:34,560
we need to look for novel ideas to do the same thing. And we need variety in packages, variety

479
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:41,200
in techniques. And we find that variety with you. And so big science is not possible without open

480
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:51,120
source software. So this is where I end. Stay tuned for fun EHT results coming up. And thank you very much.
