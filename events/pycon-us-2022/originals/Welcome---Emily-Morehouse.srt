1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,680
All right, everyone. Welcome to PyCon 2022. So, it has been three years since we were

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,920
all last in person together. I spent a lot of time sort of trying to imagine what it

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:29,340
would feel like being back here in person, and I can tell you that anything that I imagined

4
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:36,180
has paled in comparison to what it's like to be back. And so, a lot has happened since

5
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,540
2019. I think we all know this. We've gone through things that we never could have foreseen,

6
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:48,540
and in a weird way, life sort of continued on throughout the pandemic. We've all had

7
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:56,700
losses and struggles, and I was first invited to chair PyCon back in 2018. And so, typically,

8
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:03,220
you sit in a chair for a year and then chair for two years. And I remember having a conversation

9
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,260
back in 2018 with E, who was the conference chair at the time, and I was like, I just

10
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:14,020
don't know where I'll be in that many years. And I just could not have possibly imagined

11
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:19,060
the things that this would have thrown at us throughout the pandemic. And so, one of

12
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,300
the most valuable things about our community is how accepting we are. And you see this

13
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,180
in occurrences like this. We were able to shift online and find other ways to still

14
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,140
try to connect as a community, how willing we were to come in with an open mind and creative

15
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:41,140
solutions. But none of that could really compare to what it would be like back in person. And

16
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,180
so, in the last three years, things sort of passed in this weird time vortex. So much

17
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,940
has changed, yet here we are again, like nothing's changed. And so, I'll see friends that I've

18
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,260
known for years or people that I've exclusively met over Zoom calls and it's like we just

19
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:02,780
saw each other yesterday. And that is what I think makes our community so unique. And

20
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,980
so, with that, I'm Emily Morehouse. I'm honored to have served for the last three years as

21
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,300
your steward of PyCon and I'm grateful from the bottom of my heart that I'm here with

22
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:18,340
you in person today. So, on behalf of the PyCon 2022 staff, I want to start by saying

23
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:24,220
thanks. Thanks to all of the volunteers who make every facet of this conference possible.

24
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,620
To the PyCon Software Foundation, its board and staff for taking on the management and

25
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,540
fiscal responsibility of this conference. To all of the sponsors who supported us through

26
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,700
our time online and have come back to sponsor us in person. To all of the presenters who

27
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,220
have come here to share their work. And to all of our attendees, both all of you in person

28
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,860
and those who are watching this live stream, we would be nothing without you. And so, welcome

29
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,180
to Salt Lake City. I really hope that you all can take the time to sort of see the sights

30
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,420
and experience what this awesome city has to offer. There's definitely something for

31
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,220
everyone. Food, a bunch of outdoor things to do, hiking, museums, tons of beautiful

32
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,140
churches and just a really great way, great transit system and I hope that you get to

33
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,220
experience a little bit of something about the city outside of these conference walls.

34
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:23,180
So, let's talk about what PyCon is. This is your very first PyCon. Congratulations and

35
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:29,420
I am sorry because PyCon has grown to be such a giant event that we just can't give you an

36
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:35,740
overview of every single event in this welcome. So, if this is your first PyCon, I hope that

37
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:41,580
you were able to attend the newcomer orientation yesterday with Kojo Trey and Melanie. But for

38
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,740
those of you who didn't, we have these little green pins that some folks are wearing on their

39
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:51,180
badges that say ask me. And so, if you have any questions about the conference or how to get the

40
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,180
most out of your experience here, find one of those people and I'm sure that they will be

41
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:02,060
absolutely thrilled to tell you about all things PyCon. So, from a high level, PyCon is separated

42
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,460
into three sections. The first doesn't really matter because it's over but that was our first

43
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,660
two tutorial days. So, starting today we have our three main conference days which will be followed

44
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,180
by two days of sprints. So, zooming a little bit further, today and tomorrow your day will start

45
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,620
with a keynote or keynotes followed by talks for the bulk of the day and then we'll close out with

46
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,660
lightning talks. On Sunday we've got a little bit of a different schedule. We're going to have a

47
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,820
couple of panels and a keynote in the morning and then you're going to go right into the job fair.

48
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,140
And then we'll have a smaller bulk of afternoon talks followed by our closing keynote and PSF

49
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:45,820
state of address. So, our keynotes. Right after this we're going to have Mukesh Langa. Tomorrow

50
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:52,140
we will have Sarah Isawan and Peter Wang. Sunday we'll have the Python Steering Council and Sunday

51
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,580
we will have Naomi Seder to close us out. But make sure you get here early on Sunday. We will still

52
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,020
start at 9 a.m. and we're going to have a special diversity inclusion work group panel at 9 a.m.

53
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,860
After the talk today, before keynotes tomorrow morning and again tomorrow after talks and then

54
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,700
Sunday morning before our keynote you'll find our lightning talks. And so these are fascinating

55
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:22,380
little events. Definitely take a chance to come in and peek in if you can or if you're interested

56
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,780
in giving a lightning talk we will have a sign up for this. It is something where you can talk about

57
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,980
anything and everything as long as it adheres to our code of conduct. It doesn't have to be

58
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,020
Python related but certainly can be and it's just a great place to share all those super weird little

59
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,140
ideas or things that you learned last week that you would love to share with others.

60
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:47,580
So, let's take a moment to sort of familiarize ourselves with the space that we are in because

61
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,980
we have quite a large space and we are a little bit spread out with a couple of things.

62
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:57,500
So, right now you are here in the grand ballroom which will host our plenary sessions over the next

63
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:04,220
three days. To your right, my left through these doors or out those doors and around the corner

64
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:10,940
we have our expo hall. This is located in exhibit C, D and E. It should be super obvious we are

65
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,980
sharing the space with another event so definitely take a look and make sure that you are seeing

66
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:22,220
make sure that you are seeing Python related signs wherever you are going. But all of our garage

67
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,540
doors should be open. It should be very obvious where the expo hall is. This is really going to

68
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,620
be the main hub of the conference and it contains tons of things so let's list at least most of them.

69
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,700
All meals for Sunday will be served in the expo hall. Please note that coffee and snacks

70
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,580
that happen during the breaks will be located directly outside of the talk rooms. So, don't

71
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,740
think that you have to run back from a talk to the expo hall to grab a coffee in between.

72
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:55,180
They will be very closely located to you. If you have indicated that you have any allergies or

73
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,620
dietary restrictions on your registration, make sure that you take a look for signs to direct

74
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,900
you in that area and if you ever have any concerns about ingredients or the food, please make sure

75
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:12,860
that you find a conference staff and ask them. And also, please take note and be aware of traffic

76
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:19,180
patterns while you are in the expo hall. We've tried to sort of facilitate a one-way flow

77
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,460
throughout a lot of the spaces. Some areas will have arrows on the floor. Just please be aware

78
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,580
of the ways that you're interacting with your fellow attendees as we are still trying to

79
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:35,740
maintain a decent amount of health and safety as much as possible. You will also find all of the

80
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,540
sponsor booths and the startup row in the expo hall. Definitely check out our sponsors. They are

81
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,260
doing really cool things. They put a lot of effort and money to put together really awesome

82
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:51,420
booze and bring swag for everyone. And honestly, these are just the people who have continued to

83
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:58,860
invest in PyCon and in the PSF who have allowed us to continue to flourish over the last couple of

84
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:06,620
years. All right. And then the posters and job fair. If you are looking for a job or are interested

85
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:14,300
in the posters, this is when the expo hall will transition over. Expo hall will be sponsors and

86
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,100
booths Friday and Saturday and then it's going to transition overnight. So when you come in Sunday

87
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,060
morning, it's going to be a whole new experience and we'll have all of our posters as well as the

88
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:32,380
job fair. All right. So talks. Talks are in three different areas of the conference space.

89
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,660
So charlas will be on this floor in a room number that I can't read but there's another slide that

90
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:42,860
has that room number on it. Otherwise, all of our talks will be on the second level or on the third

91
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,420
level. Again, check out those PyCon signs. They're going to be directing you which elevators and

92
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:54,620
escalators to use and how to get to those spaces. So this year we actually have five talk tracks on

93
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,740
our first two days and four on the last day with 92 sessions this year, which is incredible because

94
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,580
that's almost what we've had during our pre-pandemic in-person events. But unless you

95
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:11,420
have a time turner, you will only have 18 opportunities to see talks. But don't worry,

96
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,060
most of the talks will be recorded and available online as soon as possible. So definitely take

97
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,420
this into account for how you are scheduling your time. Don't burn yourself out going to talks.

98
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:27,500
Make sure that you are taking time to, one, take care of yourself and two, talk to other attendees

99
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:34,140
at the conference. We also have open spaces available. So these are an incredible opportunity

100
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:40,460
to meet with other attendees, share and learn and maybe find those people who have those funny

101
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,900
little interests or topics that you also really, really love. So you can organize your own or just

102
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:54,380
attend someone else's. So check out this URL, PyCon.us. And there will be a recent-ish photo

103
00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:00,300
of the open spaces board. But be sure to check out that board in person if you want to sign up

104
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:08,460
for something. It will be outside of the stack room in 150A. And so PyCon has consumed the bulk

105
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,660
of this conference center. And so one of the best unofficial events that PyCon and many other

106
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:20,300
conferences have become known for is the hallway track. So again, join a table, meet somebody new,

107
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,780
open a laptop and work on a problem together. Track down that person that you've been wanting

108
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,460
to meet in person or that you haven't seen in years that you just want to say hi to.

109
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,580
And always keep in mind that when you are standing in a group of people, always leave room for one

110
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,940
extra person to join. This is a quote from air culture and it is a really excellent way to sort

111
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,820
of model inclusiveness in our community. So if you're standing in a group of people and somebody

112
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:51,500
wanders up and says, hey, can I chat with y'all? Make sure that you introduce yourself, say hi,

113
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,780
and maybe ask them, you know, is this your first PyCon? What are you excited about? And just start

114
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:03,980
up a conversation. All right. Some more fun logistical things. Okay. So there are two gender

115
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,940
neutral bathrooms throughout the conference center. One is near the first aid room on this floor. So

116
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:15,500
it's just around the corner from the gendered bathrooms. And then there is another one upstairs

117
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:22,220
near room 255 near one of the top rooms. There are also mother's rooms. While they are very poorly

118
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:28,060
named, they are located at nearly every bathroom. But please note that some are inside the women's

119
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:33,580
restroom. Some are outside. But they are indeed available to any lactating person. They're equipped

120
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:39,900
with a nice comfy chair, fridge, and sink. And if this applies to you, come find me. I'm a new mom

121
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:46,460
and I would love to meet my fellow PyCon parents. All right. And then if you find that you need to

122
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:53,020
take a break, focus on some quiet work or just breathe, we do have a quiet room located in 151B.

123
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,580
So that's, again, just going to be a little bit down that hallway on your right-hand side,

124
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,940
down one of the smaller hallways on the right. There's a sign out front. So if you need to take

125
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,460
a break, just breathe. Please make sure that you are taking into account the rules of this room.

126
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:15,580
Please don't listen to music, play videos on your laptop, take phone calls, etc. This is really

127
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:22,060
supposed to be a quiet space for people to take a step back and recharge on their own. Feel free to

128
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,900
use headphones, but please be mindful of the other people who might be using that space with you.

129
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:33,500
All right. So one of our favorite events is the Pi Ladies auction. That will be taking place

130
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:40,300
tomorrow night at 6 30 p.m. at the Marriott that is right across the street. Don't go to the one

131
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,220
that's 15 minutes away. You don't have to go that far. Please make sure you're going to the correct

132
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:50,060
Marriott, but it is directly across the street from the conference center. It's a ton of fun.

133
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,740
You get to bid on a bunch of items, have some food, hang out with people. It is often a rowdy good

134
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,740
time with lots of numbers being spewed at you and people throwing money at a really, really excellent

135
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,340
cause. This event is currently sold out, so if you have a ticket and you aren't planning on

136
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,420
attending, please consider giving it to somebody else to make sure that we can use up all of those

137
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:17,740
tickets. It helps reduce our food waste and ensures that we can keep this event very lively.

138
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:26,620
Okay. We're getting there. All right. So there's tons going on at PyCon this year. As you can tell,

139
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,420
our mobile application through Guidebook is the absolute best place for you to find our up-to-date

140
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,940
information for the conference, view maps of the venue, create your own schedule, have access to

141
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,060
all of this information offline in your pocket. So definitely download the Guidebook app. You can

142
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:48,140
get it really easily at PyCon.us slash Guidebook, or there's additional information on installing

143
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:55,020
and getting access on the PyCon website. All right. So I've mentioned a few times the

144
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:00,140
PyCon Software Foundation that takes on the financial responsibility of running this conference.

145
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,820
We would not be here without the work of our PSF board and staff. So if you are able to,

146
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,700
or your company is able to, please consider donating. You can navigate to this URL and

147
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:23,020
get access to the PSF sponsorship page. We also have our swag pickup. I noticed that some people

148
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:28,060
were already out there grabbing their swag. This year we do just have stickers and anyone who

149
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,020
ordered a t-shirt ahead of time, those are available to pick up currently. We will have

150
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:38,940
a limited number of t-shirts available for sale tomorrow afternoon around 1 p.m. But if you want

151
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,020
to purchase this shirt and you haven't already, you will have to wait until tomorrow to do so.

152
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:51,180
We also have a small locations change. The Charlotte's Track is no longer in 253 A&B.

153
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:57,100
It is now in 151 D, E, F, and G. This has been updated everywhere that you will find your

154
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,900
information. The PyCon site, guidebook, and signage have all been updated, but we wanted

155
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:08,780
to call this out to make sure that you are going to the proper location. Also, if you are taking

156
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,740
photos of the event, please be aware that any attendees with yellow dots on their badges

157
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:20,220
have opted out of photos. So please take care not to post any photos for anyone who might have

158
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,780
these dots on their badges. Additionally, if you want to opt out of photos and you haven't

159
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:31,180
gotten these yet, they are available at the registration desk. Finally, if there is anything

160
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:37,820
that you need, you can tweet at the conference or at staff at PyCon on Twitter. We are monitoring

161
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:43,180
that account pretty closely. If you want to post about the conference, please use the hashtag

162
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:51,260
PyCon US 2022. Now, one of the most important things for us to discuss today is health and safety.

163
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,980
Oh, and apparently my notes for health and safety are gone, so that's

164
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,540
not the best thing to happen. So give me one second because I do want to make sure that I have this

165
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,540
as close as possible.

166
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:22,140
Okay. So we'll go back to slides in a minute. But we wanted to say that we are incredibly grateful

167
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:27,980
to how positive the response has been to all of the health and safety policies that we put in place

168
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:33,340
and how strict our measures have been to ensure that PyCon US can occur in the safest way possible.

169
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:39,900
And so I need to remind everyone that masks are only to be removed while actively eating or drinking,

170
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,740
or if you are a speaker who is up at the podium speaking, please make sure that you are putting

171
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:51,100
your mask on right afterwards before you talk to any participants who might have questions for you.

172
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,460
But this is really for us to make sure that we are participating in the safest way possible and

173
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:02,140
protecting all of the individuals here. There's just no way to know what somebody else has going

174
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,940
on, right? There are a lot of folks who have small children who are immunocompromised or who have

175
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,740
other risks, and one of the ways that they are able to be here attending and that they were able to

176
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:18,620
balance that risk was this agreement that we all made to continue wearing masks. So this is your

177
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:26,300
verbal warning. Monitoring starts now. If you are spotted without a mask on, a staff member will

178
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:33,020
remind you to put it on and they will have a small hole punch and they will put a small hole

179
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,060
in your badge so that we know that you have been given your first strike.

180
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:42,780
Second strike is going to be a discussion with the staff. If we catch you without a mask on for a

181
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,860
second time, we're going to bring you into the staff office and have a conversation and make

182
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,900
sure that it is very clear what the next strike is, and that is because your third strike means

183
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,940
that you are going home for the rest of the conference. We will gladly switch you over to

184
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:03,180
an online ticket so that you can still participate and watch talks and whatnot. However,

185
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,860
we will not allow you back into the conference or for any of the outside ticketed events for the

186
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:19,500
conference. So. All right. And with that very fun announcement, I also want to call out

187
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,860
accessibility. We will be providing live captioning for all of our talks this year,

188
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:30,700
very similar to what you see to my, oh, I actually can't see them. I think they're on,

189
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:37,740
I hope that we have captioning on this. Maybe we don't. Oh, thanks. Hey, look at that. So we do

190
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:44,060
have captioning. So additionally, each space will have reserved seating for wheelchair access. It

191
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:48,700
will be noted on the floors. It's generally going to be towards the center of the room. And as well,

192
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,220
the conference is ADA compliant. However, if you have any concerns or need any additional support,

193
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,500
please let a staff member know. We also want to say a huge thanks to our captioning sponsors.

194
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:10,140
These are all folks who have supported the funds to have captioning not only for all of our

195
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,060
Planneries but also all five of our track rooms, which is incredible.

196
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,900
And so our last and also very important item is PyCon's code of conduct. So we are deeply

197
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,300
committed to providing a safe environment and a positive experience for everyone here.

198
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:34,300
In order to ensure this, everyone here, all staff, attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers,

199
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:39,580
anyone who is here that is related to this PyCon event are required to adhere to our code of conduct.

200
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:46,140
Absolutely no one is an exception. No one is above the law. So no harassment, whether verbal

201
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:51,020
or physical or discrimination will be tolerated. Every person here will be provided with a

202
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:57,900
harassment-free experience regardless of gender, gender identity, expression, age, sexual orientation,

203
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:03,580
disability, neuro-type, physical appearance, body size, race or religion, or lack thereof.

204
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:10,540
We take this incredibly seriously and want to make sure that everyone here can have a safe

205
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,100
as an experience as possible. So you can read more in the code of conduct as well as the

206
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,820
linked procedures for how we approach handling incidents and what our responses are going to

207
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,700
look like as well as what enforcement looks like. So you can find all of these documents at the

208
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:31,180
URL on our screen or at the PyCon website on about slash code of conduct.

209
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,860
So if you believe somebody has violated the code of conduct, you are encouraged to report it

210
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:44,460
regardless of the severity. At any point, you can make a report by emailing PyCon-us-report

211
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:51,100
at python.org or during the conference, you can come by the staff room and that's in 150A and we

212
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,820
will make sure that we find the right person for you to talk to.
