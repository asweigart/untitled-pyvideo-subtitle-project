00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hi everybody. We're going to start our session. I'm very happy to introduce our speaker,

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Samweli Mwakisambwe from Tanzania. I would like to welcome our speaker.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hi, I'm Samweli Mwakisambwe. I'm going to present to you how you can use Python and PyFuji as your call maps.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:56,000
About myself, I'm from Tanzania. I work for Katowice as a software developer. I'm also a QGIS core and QGIS Python plugins developer.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The following are topics that we are going to go through. We're going to look at what is QGIS, how you can make maps with QGIS,

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
what's the relation between QGIS and Python, and what's the PyQGIS API.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Then we're going to look at how we can make Python applications and plugins using QGIS.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Then we're going to look at QGIS and power control functionality. After that, we're going to create some awesome animated maps using Python.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So what is QGIS? QGIS is a desktop application for creation and editing of geospatial data.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So you can use it to create some additional data. You can use it to do some analysis on the data, but you can use it to align the geospatial data.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It has a number of features, and it enables you to create any number of styles that you want in your map.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This is one example of a map made from QGIS. This is the place in Bogota, Colombia.

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The map tries to show how the building in that place will look like in night, but by using a thing called the strain lamp.

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is just one example of how QGIS is powerful and allows you to customize your map to your need.

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This image shows QGIS in action when one of the QGIS users is making a map.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This map is for network analysis. They are called answer-conse maps. They are usually created in order to show the accessibility of different service areas to different social facilities.

18
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is another map made from QGIS. QGIS also has compost support. What you see right now is a map that shows the movement of isobates in the source core.

19
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This is another example. You can see on the right side, you can see the timelapse.

20
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:30,000
These are just a few examples of the maps that QGIS can enable users to make. There are various and many examples, and one would be able to cover all of them in this session.

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
QGIS enables you to make analysis and publish the special data. You create your maps and manage your maps. It is free to download and use.

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It is open source, created by a number of developers from the world world.

23
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Now we know what QGIS is. Let's take a look at the relation between QGIS and Python. QGIS application at core is developed using C++, but it also supports Python through Python bindings.

24
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You could have a developer for a Python plugin that adds the functionalities in QGIS.

25
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The users for Python in QGIS is that you can use Python to write standalone Python applications, as we will look at at a later moment.

26
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You can also use it to create plugins.

27
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is the plugin manager inside QGIS. It shows all the plugins inside QGIS.

28
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
As you can see already, we have a number of QGIS plugins developed for the user side of QGIS.

29
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I think there are around a thousand plugins. You can use it to access and download and use the QGIS that we need to create for this plugin manager.

30
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
How do we like Python applications and plugins for QGIS?

31
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
First of all, there are different ways to install QGIS. You could install it as an application on the computer, but you could also download it and use it as a package.

32
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The way to go through that is by using an account.

33
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
When you are writing Python applications, you could write applications when you have installed your QGIS applications on your computer.

34
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Or you could write your application by using the QGIS package.

35
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You see there is a bit of difference when you are writing your Python application when your QGIS is installed as standard compared to when QGIS is installed as a standard application.

36
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is a simple example of a Python application.

37
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Just to show a simple one layer, you can see on the left side there is the code that we used to create the light window.

38
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:22,000
On the top there you can see there are some libraries. QGIS is built on top of PyQT.

39
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You can see that we are setting the prefix.

40
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This is where the difference is between whether the user installed the application as a standalone or using Conda.

41
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If you installed it as a standalone, then the location and the prefix packs will be different than if you installed it as an application itself.

42
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
How do we make plugins for QGIS?

43
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The most recommended way is using the plugin builder.

44
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If you want to start making plugins for QGIS, let's say there is a functionalizer that does not seem like QGIS, but you want to add that functionality, you have to use this plugin builder.

45
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We do not recommend for beginners to use that.

46
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It is also a QGIS plugin, so you just go open QGIS and search for plugin builder.

47
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Once you install it, you can learn it.

48
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It gives you this option where you enter your details.

49
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:46,000
After you create all those details, you have a template that looks like this.

50
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,000
After this, you can start your QGIS plugin development.

51
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This is an example of a QGIS plugin.

52
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is written in Python.

53
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It is available in the QGIS repository.

54
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
According to QGIS, it does not support natively using your stack API data.

55
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The aim of this plugin is to add that functionality to QGIS.

56
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Let's say if you have a stack API and you want to navigate and download the guest patch for data, then you have to install this plugin.

57
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What is Tempo Controller?

58
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Tempo Controller is QGIS feature that enables QGIS to be able to handle temporal data.

59
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Before the Tempo Controller, QGIS didn't have support for temporal data.

60
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You required to install the plugin.

61
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
One of the plugins that was very popular was called Time Manager plugin by Andy Tompey.

62
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It was very popular and it had almost 10,000 downloads.

63
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Now there is Tempo Controller and it handles all of the temporal data that's inside QGIS.

64
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:16,000
One of the things that I would like you to know is that because you have to dive into the technical details when you are making an invented map with QGIS,

65
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
you have to understand how the Tempo Controller is built.

66
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
One thing that I would like you to understand is that inside the Tempo Controller there is a QGIS temporal navigation object.

67
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Each time you want to make an invented map using a Python application, you should always look out for the API for this object.

68
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Let's go through just one example of how you can build a Python application and showcase how to make an invented map using Python QGIS.

69
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm just going to use weather data from the Canada Metrology Project.

70
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm going to use that to create just a simple app that will navigate through the weather data.

71
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm going to specifically show you the air temperature of the world.

72
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
This is the script that does the job.

73
00:10:46,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You can see that when importing the main libraries from Qt, we are setting the dates that we want to navigate on that data.

74
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:14,000
After that, we have this function called line, which is setting the QGIS application.

75
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The other part here is to check the perfect pass.

76
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Because I'm using Ubuntu and I've installed QGIS locations of our one that we use at Anetka,

77
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
so that's why I'm setting it here.

78
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Then I'm going to initialize the QGIS application.

79
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:42,000
After that, I'm creating the window and I'm pulling down the last layer, which is the layer that contains the weather data.

80
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
After that, I'm adding that layer into map canvas.

81
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
As you can see here, I'm setting the extent of map canvas.

82
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:02,000
If you just learn this, I'm going to show you the spreadsheet.

83
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This is the world air temperature as of today.

84
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This shows us for today.

85
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We have a number of battles below here.

86
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You can just click and see that the weather has changed.

87
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It has showed the data for that day.

88
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Also, if I just click for the...

89
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The interval between those dates is just three hours.

90
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
For the next three hours, it's looking at this.

91
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The next three hours, it looks at that.

92
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Then the following hours, it looks at that.

93
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I also added a slider just below here.

94
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You can just pull down the slider.

95
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Then you can see how the air temperature changes.

96
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It just does come down.

97
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
We could also just come in and just add another date.

98
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Let's say we want to add another one.

99
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
We only have five dates.

100
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm just going to add the sixth date.

101
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll just call it that way.

102
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The time it fixes copies.

103
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
These are called fixes.

104
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll just put it back.

105
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll just go for it.

106
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Fix.

107
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So we used our fix.

108
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm going to call it fix.

109
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So one and twenty.

110
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Then I'll just add it in the list.

111
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I also want to add that time.

112
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Let's just make it the maximum is three hours,

113
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
four hours, the maximum is five.

114
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Then we're going to add the widget to the layout.

115
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Let's say six.

116
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm going to push the date.

117
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm just going to stop the application.

118
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Then I'm going to run it again.

119
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What's the point?

120
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Okay, so the video is over there.

121
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Let's remove that.

122
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Run it again.

123
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Hello, the name is here.

124
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Save it.

125
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah.

126
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So there we have it.

127
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So you can see that instead of only five entries,

128
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
we've added another entry here, which is...

129
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yay!

130
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So if we click that, we should be getting data for that time.

131
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So you can see the changes.

132
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So if you're in the mid-night, it's like that,

133
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
but three hours later, it should be back.

134
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And the slider, so forth, should be working.

135
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It should be.

136
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Don't have any issues navigating through this.

137
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So this is an example of how you can just write

138
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
a Python application that uses QGIS capabilities,

139
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
because without QGIS, you won't be able to point that way.

140
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'll show the different data and different dates.

141
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And this Python application is available

142
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
in the presentation request,

143
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
which I'll share with you later

144
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
after I finish the presentation.

145
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Another thing that I would like to just...

146
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So we have seen this example that I would like to show you,

147
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
because this is just a simple example,

148
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and it's not that complex.

149
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But inside QGIS, the Tempor Control itself is very powerful,

150
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and it has more options compared to what we've just seen here,

151
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
because here we have just this text,

152
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and then we have this slider.

153
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But if you use QGIS Tempor Control feature,

154
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
which you should also be able to use it here

155
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
in the Python application,

156
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
it should be having something like what I'm about to show you right now.

157
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So this is the same layer open inside QGIS,

158
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
but right now we are not using Python.

159
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
We are using QGIS itself.

160
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So you could also navigate inside QGIS.

161
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You could also go through the different layers

162
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
that you want to view, go through it.

163
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The only difference is that because of this Tempor Control,

164
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
which we are seeing right here,

165
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
it has more features.

166
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You could just go back or go to the end.

167
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You could play it.

168
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You could add more steps.

169
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Let's say you want to go up to 20,

170
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
let's say 24.

171
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And then just go through the layers data.

172
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yep.

173
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So each time you go, it changes the image.

174
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So then you won't have to change it again after you come back.

175
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And then, yeah, as we were saying,

176
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
this Tempor Control has more features

177
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
compared to a simple app that we used.

178
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And one of the features that are very cool

179
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
is that the Tempor Control has the loop,

180
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
which is this one,

181
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
where you can just loop your animation

182
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and choose the sequence that you want

183
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
to navigate the animation.

184
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Let's say you want to...

185
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So something is in the digit-fixed file,

186
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
filling in the CD.

187
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Let me just go back and...

188
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah, it can be fixed so well.

189
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So it's very cool when you are able to fix

190
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
the languages that it's adding to our settings.

191
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So just push it a bit.

192
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, that should do it.

193
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yes, right now if we go back

194
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and just play the animation,

195
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
you can see the small detail

196
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
and it gives you a feeling of how the air temperature on Earth is.

197
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And you can also, if you don't want to make it fun,

198
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
you can also just increase...

199
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Very cool, right?

200
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah.

201
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So, yeah, so...

202
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And other layers, too.

203
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
This is just air temperature,

204
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
there's wind waves and a number of different layers

205
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
that you could use for the Tempor Control.

206
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But this capability is also possible

207
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
inside the Python application.

208
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So what you need is to just sit down

209
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and dive in how the QGIS temporal application

210
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
works and then put it inside your Python application.

211
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Because I've already shown you this is a deep what you could do,

212
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
but if you want to do more with it,

213
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
then you need to sit down and go to your Python application.

214
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah, so I just came back to the slides.

215
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I would like to show you more of this animated mask,

216
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
but we don't have much time.

217
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's just for...

218
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
There's a...

219
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
For those who want some inspiration on how to work

220
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
with QGIS navigation, QGIS Tempor Control,

221
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
there's this plugin called QGIS Animation Workbench,

222
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
developed by Tim Sarton and Nile Doosan,

223
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and it's a contribution from other developers.

224
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So this plugin exposes and shows how you could use

225
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
the PyQGIS, CKR, with the temporal controller

226
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
to make some cool maps.

227
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And this is all Python.

228
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
There's no C++.

229
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's only Python that you need to like.

230
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So one example of the cool animation from this plugin

231
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
is that code.

232
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So what you're seeing is developers across the world,

233
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
the QGIS developers across the world in their home locations.

234
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So if I just replay that, you could see a couple

235
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
of developers from America, South America.

236
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
There's two in Africa.

237
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The upper one is me.

238
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yeah, and yeah, so we invite people to come

239
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
and contribute to QGIS.

240
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So because when you contribute to QGIS,

241
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
you want to contribute in order to QGIS.

242
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And then you're also supporting the Python developers

243
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
who are wanting to talk with the QGIS functionality

244
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
in Python, the content at functionality.

245
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So yeah, so support for QGIS.

246
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That's the QGIS user repository.

247
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And if you want to open an issue,

248
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
you can just go to that issue page.

249
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah, so these are the resources.

250
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The QGIS API is found there.

251
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The presentation materials, if you want to see those

252
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Python applications that I just showed here,

253
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
you can just go to that GitHub link.

254
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And then you could also visit qgis.org.

255
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's the website.

256
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yeah, that's it.

257
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Questions?

258
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah, I think that's it.

259
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I think that's it.

260
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Thank you.

261
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
If you have a question, you could come close to the mic.

262
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yeah, next there.

263
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Thank you for that.

264
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
One question is, do they have any plug-ins

265
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
with like the Google Maps API, then,

266
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
if you ever want to say,

267
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
like, to match this data or maybe like that,

268
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
or maybe, say more,

269
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
if I'm assuming this is from a separate database,

270
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
how would you know it's going to change

271
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
if you're going to have to do a lot more than that?

272
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yeah, so you can do that

273
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
if you have your data that is changing.

274
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
That means that's how you implement it on your plugin.

275
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So QGIS doesn't stick to you at all.

276
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So we have a number of plugins that we use

277
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
that are for all that have

278
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
the user being stopped and want only to export

279
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
their service to when best possible,

280
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
because QGIS doesn't interact with your

281
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Python implementation at all.

282
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So it's just you and how you implement maybe

283
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
your authentication or the phishing of data.

284
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Thank you.

285
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Thank you.

286
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Thank you very much.

287
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I was wondering, can you embed any of these

288
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
maps or animations into web pages?

289
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah, so due to the time, I couldn't show you,

290
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
because the tempo controller also has an option

291
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
to export these animations.

292
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So you could use that.

293
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yeah, and you could also

294
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
copy into that and save your Python application.

295
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
This thing, relative Python application,

296
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
you could also add it, you know,

297
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
another way of taking your source of exporting,

298
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
of course, and implement it also.

299
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Thanks.

300
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Right.

301
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Thank you.

302
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Are you aware of any plugins or anything that

303
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
we could use for satellite images,

304
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
analysis combined with QGIS and Python

305
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
or any other videos that you use?

306
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah, I know a couple.

307
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Do you mean the one that's going to register for?

308
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Do you have an idea for?

309
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Because there are a number.

310
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I understand that Planet has the plugin,

311
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
and it's inside QGIS.

312
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
That's only useful for the user who have Planet account.

313
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So there's something like that.

314
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Maybe.

315
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yeah.

316
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
No more questions?

317
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Well, there's no more questions.

318
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Thank you so much.

319
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Okay.

320
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Thanks.

321
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Thank you.

322
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Thank you so much.

323
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Thank you.

324
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Thanks.

325
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Thank you.

326
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Thank you.

327
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Thank you.
