Here are some terms and phrases from the transcription that may have been incorrectly transcribed, especially proper names, acronyms, or technical jargon:

1. **"My green name is Steve"** - This might be a transcription error. It could have been "My given name is Steve" or "My screen name is Steve."

2. **"CodeUMI"** - This seems like a proper noun that could be incorrectly transcribed. It might refer to a company or project, and the correct name might be different, such as "Codecademy," "CodeUMI," or something similar.

3. **"foods for general tests"** - This phrase is unclear. It might have been something like "tools for general tests."

5. **"Fugitive 4"** - This looks like an incorrect transcription. It could be "Pitfall 4" or "Mistake 4."

6. **"Foodman 5"** - Likely a transcription error, possibly meant to be "Pitfall 5" or "Rule 5."

8. **"Delegate Tests"** - This might be incorrectly transcribed. It could refer to "Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Tests" or something similar.

9. **"SQLite"** - This is a proper name and might be transcribed correctly, but it’s worth double-checking to ensure it wasn’t altered.
