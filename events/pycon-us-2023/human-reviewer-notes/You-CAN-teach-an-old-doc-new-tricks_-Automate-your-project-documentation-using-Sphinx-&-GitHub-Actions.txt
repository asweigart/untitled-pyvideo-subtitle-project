1. **"Lance"** (00:00:02) - This could be a name, but if it's a reference to a tool, library, or lesser-known figure, it might be misheard.
2. **"Aya bought three something"** (00:00:29) - Likely a transcription error, possibly "Aya bought 3 years" or something similar.
3. **"Sphinx"** (00:00:47) - Proper noun for a documentation tool used in Python projects, likely correct but essential to check context in case of confusion.
4. **"latex"** (00:01:12) - Correct spelling should be "LaTeX" for the typesetting system.

6. **"Riddle.py"** (00:12:52) - This might be a project-specific file, but "Riddle" could be misheard; could be something like "Riddler.py" or a similar technical name.
7. **"checkReadLancer"** (00:14:23) - Likely a function or method name, could be incorrectly transcribed. Might be something like "checkRiddleAnswer."
8. **"Napoleon"** (00:14:43) - Likely referring to the Sphinx extension "Napoleon" for docstring formatting, but worth verifying.
9. **"PyLadies London"** (00:02:53) - Correct name for a Python community, but if not contextually clear, might be misunderstood.
10. **"actions-githubpages"** (00:31:31) - This might be "actions-gh-pages" which is commonly used for GitHub Pages workflows, so verify syntax.

These terms could benefit from context verification or a quick check against known tools, libraries, or project-specific terminology.
