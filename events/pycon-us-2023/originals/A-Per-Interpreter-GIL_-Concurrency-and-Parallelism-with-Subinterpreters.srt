1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I can google it, i can..

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,840
But there is no way to follow these

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,240
Anfit not only from the burden of knowledge

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,240
But also from the burden of education

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,660
Todays we all think that about the new

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,980
Cos I have no interest in the study

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,960
But i thought that i could also

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,040
Talk about social alienation

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,000
And for this background

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I know I have kept some in mind

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,460
The e Premium should focus on web

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,680
And Im gonna talk about dark

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,860
The 성공. Im gonna just give you

14
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:54,580
a

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,580
I was told that it was totally overflown, and it was a problem.

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,580
I was pressed to go to the police to investigate.

17
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,580
I was told that I had to go to the police to investigate.

18
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,580
I was pressed to go.

19
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,580
And there would be on five seconds, I was told, to fix the screen.

20
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,580
I was told that I had to go to the police to investigate.

21
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,580
Which is pretty important for the police, because they're going to investigate.

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,580
I was told that I had to go to the police, and they were afraid of the lights.

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,580
I went to the police to investigate.

24
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,580
And they came back to the police.

25
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,580
This would go a bit further in the process.

26
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,580
But then I was told that I had to go to the police to investigate.

27
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,580
Because I was pressed to go to the police.

28
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,580
I was told that I had to go to the police.

29
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,580
The only perfectly clear concept is the most famous one, so to speak.

30
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,580
For this part, it's a complete loop, and you're not supposed to be able to do anything with that.

31
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,580
The world is full of different things, and it's a complex.

32
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,580
Today we're conscious of this mess, and it's a lot of waste.

33
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,580
It's a complex of things.

34
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,580
And it's so much more simple to see, for example.

35
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,580
I was focused in the first half of this process.

36
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,580
It was also a question of whether it could be used in the past.

37
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,580
And I was just so surprised that people were so focused on the process.

38
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,580
Another thing that should be comfortable is getting this pretty simple concept.

39
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,580
It will work for you, so those who are familiar with this case will be surprised by this concept.

40
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,580
But for those who don't know, it's a complex of things.

41
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,580
So it's a simple process.

42
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,580
It's a simple process.

43
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,580
So it's a simple process.

44
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,580
And it's just a simple idea.

45
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,580
Let's go back to the first.

46
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,580
If anybody has any questions about whether to use the concept,

47
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,580
please leave a comment below so we can answer them.

48
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,580
And if you have questions, please feel free to post them.

49
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,580
I'll be happy to answer them.

50
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,580
So, first, let's talk about some of the different examples.

51
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,580
Can you tell us anything about the concept of the concept?

52
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,580
I think it's a complex.

53
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,580
I know there are specific questions, but I'll just say that it's a complex.

54
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,580
It's a complex.

55
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,580
This is the best way to break down certain concepts.

56
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,580
You want to practice it in a specific way.

57
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,580
But it's not a very simple project that can be used in a very specific space.

58
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,580
It's a simple research.

59
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,580
This is a very simple idea.

60
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,580
It's a simple idea.

61
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,580
It's a simple concept.

62
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,580
It's a simple idea.

63
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,580
It's a simple concept.

64
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,580
It's a simple concept.

65
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,580
It's a simple concept.

66
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,580
The key to this points out a different focus on suggestion,

67
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,580
rather than just a simple idea.

68
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:48,780
Let's just say that we once assumed that that focus of neredeness and

69
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,780
light presence was fairly well-defined.

70
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:57,420
Do you have to see the other followers on their social accounts?

71
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,420
Everything else would be toourance of reason.

72
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,820
No creature can stand for you.

73
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:13,240
In

74
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,240
The future is not a place to be made of those who feel the pressure.

75
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,240
The pressure is not a place to be.

76
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,240
If I was to do a process for this, I would be a person who felt the pressure.

77
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,240
If I were to do a process for this, I would say, we're all in this together.

78
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,240
See, once there are some girls who feel that they need a place to stay,

79
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,240
I feel that girls that feel a sort of pressure are not safe.

80
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,240
That's a pressure that you're going to have to face sometimes.

81
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,240
It can be a person, it can be a person.

82
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,240
And so, as far as two-thirds of us, we would not be able to do this if we didn't have a place to be.

83
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,240
But most of us would be able to do something like that in the process.

84
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,240
And we would feel the pressure to suffer, you know, and all the pressure to do it.

85
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,240
We would have thought that it would be a good thing to do it.

86
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
But that's true.

87
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,240
As that's either if we didn't have a place to be, which one would we be able to do it?

88
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,240
Or those who are in this process of consulting for something which was a real positive thing,

89
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,240
even though we might have to face a concept of being a body,

90
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
that we're not going to be able to do it anyway.

91
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,240
And that's the last thing.

92
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,240
So, I'm confident that we're going to be able to do it.

93
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,240
I was able to do it because it was interesting for us to talk about it.

94
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,240
It's one of the things that we would do if we had a place in the process.

95
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:56,240
So, we've been on a project for a couple of times, a couple of times, and that's a case of division.

96
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
It's a lot of complicated tasks.

97
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
So, it's a series of tasks.

98
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,240
The first one we're going to do is to develop our presence,

99
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,240
and we're going to do it for a certain time, especially when we're doing it for a different purpose.

100
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,240
So, there's a process where we're going to do a separate process.

101
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
And that's very, very important.

102
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,240
And that's the first way we're going to do it.

103
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,240
So, it's actually a process of the same process, but with different factors.

104
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,240
And the fourth thing is that we're going to do a separate process.

105
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,240
And that's the fourth one, which is a process.

106
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,240
And we're going to do it with different factors, so that all of our projects are developed,

107
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,240
and we're going to do it for a certain time, especially for a certain purpose.

108
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,240
So, the way we're going to do it is we're going to do it for a certain time, and that's the fourth one.

109
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,240
And the fourth one is the second one, which is the third one, which is the fourth one.

110
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
And the fourth one is the fifth one, which is the sixth one.

111
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,240
So, that's where we're going to do it.

112
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,240
So, the first one is the first one, which is the fourth one, which is the fifth one.

113
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
And the fifth one is the sixth.

114
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
And the sixth one is the seventh.

115
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,240
And now, the fourth one could be a big process in terms of connecting each of these together.

116
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,240
I want to make sure it's very specific.

117
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,240
The first one is going to be very simple, but a little bit more complex.

118
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
So, the fourth one is going to be a very very simple process.

119
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,240
And it'll be about the specific process.

Welcome to the

and have a wide range of rest Так как anarchism is

125
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,060
very popular, there exists crops a lot And the main unnecessary

category of segments are slave owners and peasants

127
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,140
Such as the slave owners aren't found in the fields

128
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,300
Its particularly terrible to see Now let's first look at some crop

So I'm just like, this one.

132
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,800
I'm going to go through the process.

133
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,640
But I'm just going to show you some of the details.

134
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,080
So I'm going to take it.

135
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,580
OK.

136
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,420
So the first one is this.

137
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,860
This is beautiful.

138
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,740
This is the one that's going to be the next one.

139
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,660
And this is the one that's going to be the next one.

140
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,820
And this is the second one.

141
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,140
And the third one is this.

142
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,220
And this is the third one.

143
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,220
So it's really nice.

144
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,220
This one goes like this.

145
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,460
So there's one that's going to be the next one.

146
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,460
This is the first one.

147
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,460
This is the first one.

148
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,460
This is the third one.

149
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,460
So this is the first one.

150
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,460
This is the fourth one.

151
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,460
So I'm going to show you some of the details

152
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,460
of the actual system that just blows up.

153
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,460
You may be wondering how you can have this thing as well.

154
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,460
The first one is the first one that we get.

155
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,460
And this is the fourth one.

156
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,460
And the fourth one is the fourth one.

157
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,460
So this is the fourth one.

158
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,460
And the fifth one is the fifth one.

159
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,460
And the sixth one is the sixth one.

160
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,460
And the seventh one is the seventh one.

161
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,460
And the seventh one is the seventh one.

162
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,460
OK, before we start,

163
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,460
before we get into the first one,

164
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,460
I want to show you guys a few things

165
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,460
that I've done with this system before.

166
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,460
I guess the first one is the first one

167
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,460
that I've done with this system.

168
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Like you know, like you said,

169
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
it's a very complex system.

170
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
It's very complicated for you to see

171
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
because it's a complex system.

172
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
But I can show you what it looks like

173
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
when you put it together.

174
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
This is the first one.

175
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
This is the second one.

176
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Part of the first one is the first one

177
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
that comes with the system.

178
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
And so that comes with the entry

179
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,500
and the clear selection of the system.

180
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
So you go through the systems

181
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,500
and first you find the system.

182
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,540
So you can see the first question

183
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,540
for example,

184
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:59,540
why are there four features

185
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,540
that we don't need in our system.

186
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:19,380
You must oust a host of

187
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,780
host and

188
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,840
defeat a host of host.

189
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,140
the lecture was largelyには in front of no haya

190
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,340
there's no continues to the

191
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,460
division into the

192
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,160
quite a

193
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,920
loosely

194
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,340
There's mainly applications for intellectual students

195
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,920
which you can solo identify and associate

196
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,220
with yet again toium assigned business.

197
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,060
So I'm dead.

198
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,400
Here are the youth applications

199
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,300
some of the youth applications have been chosen

200
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,600
by my Dear Sally Beautiful,

201
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,140
a selected selection edition of the Spirit Power

202
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,260
and also a recap execution of the Spirit Selfspe Bhalla.

203
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,560
These are some of the focus of those disregard.

204
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,600
And the first one's my favorite,

205
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:36,500
These questions are well covered, however, not loved ones.

206
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,500
as sized farmers.'

207
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,460
No question of Wash Schwarzenegger

208
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,340
that everyone has his research.

209
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,780
There is a first thing that such

210
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,860
a large number of argue with him.

211
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,440
The surgery is encouraging

212
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:59,860
oil-based products and

213
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,960
the master plan.

214
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,320
For some people more often

215
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,500
people say they consider

216
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:30,980
feel like.

217
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,700
I don't know if you've heard about Sin 7 in the past,

218
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:48,700
so, why don't you Valley Southwest some ideas on how to

219
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,820
develop a copy.

220
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,860
Well, it's probably better if it starts taking this literally.

221
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,380
With some circumstances, it's true that the game looks awful,

222
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,020
What is really this lecture?

223
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,040
The problem of runt瞬 notes,

224
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,400
which stands for reinterpretation.

225
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,380
This I would've certainly presented today.

226
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,320
It was sort of what it had been,

227
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,160
in his force tut later on.

228
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,440
Usually on these lectures,

229
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,340
it doesn'tv players were lost

230
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,580
access to a different

231
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,420
class of tool.

232
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,980
These were basic proper demographics

233
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,380
just various different types of tools,

234
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,960
until something happened

235
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,280
at a certain place.

236
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:56,380
would suggest that we should live like this...

237
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,380
And that's the only thing that I think is the most interesting thing.

238
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,380
The only thing that's wrong with me,

239
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,380
and this is what I'm trying to say is that I can't use it.

240
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,380
I can't stop myself from thinking,

241
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,380
we've got to find something that's different.

242
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,380
And that is something that we've got to understand.

243
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,380
We've got to understand this is the same thing as that.

244
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,380
That is something that's not right.

245
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,380
And so that's not right.

246
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,380
That's not what I'm trying to say.

247
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,380
So I'm trying to think of things that are different from what you're saying.

248
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,380
That's what I'm trying to say.

249
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,380
So, the only interesting thing about this is that I need to sort of

250
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,380
manage things with a little bit of a different balance.

251
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,380
This is what I'm trying to do.

252
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,380
This is what I'm trying to do.

253
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,380
So you've got to get rid of the differences,

254
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,380
the instructions, the things that you're trying to do.

255
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,380
You've got to get rid of the differences.

256
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,380
And so that's what I'm trying to do.

257
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,380
That's the way to go.

258
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,380
Thank you very much.

259
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:11,380
I'm going to need auts.

260
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,440
but in fixtures of belonging too.

261
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,920
If there's a policy that fascinates you

262
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,480
so you have more leadership than those assists for you,

263
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,640
how do you support that wide range of tips

264
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,340
to say that you agree a wider range of accessory

265
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,100
and traffic collision?

266
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,240
If you say your request lots than places

267
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,500
and types of approach,

268
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,920
a solid answer to that

269
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,960
is yes.

270
00:16:36,960 --> 00:17:04,760
P abruptly clouded the

271
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:12,220
one could change the changing the way people can move or engage in that process which was

272
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:18,080
able to make fear direct surface conversion시면 and caused some forms of

273
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,600
쾌 puedes for himself.

274
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,540
And that's the second step.

275
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,060
There's the rest of the group.

276
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:30,260
So the fifth step where you want to touch on the shift to the segundos in order to

277
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:35,160
stetshi those, is put in the last point of the red line over the red line.

278
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
functionally.

279
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:58,760
You can tell

280
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:27,340
When the

281
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,700
Here, we've passed on historical information.

282
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,860
What is his understanding of the sound has been used in texts字

283
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:51,980
and in terms of mes 어쨌든

284
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,200
This concludes our oceans of information

285
00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:01,240
Before all, the

286
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,260
..

287
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:14,280
But

288
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:22,580
related to suffering and personal

289
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,520
Ind非

290
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,840
and changes our lives, and lives quickly.

291
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,960
We should tend to don't amount to degrees I depression,

292
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,080
that's good business sector and rational business.

293
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,920
And often the more of it not possible to allow

294
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,880
to follow the mostatti我的 thinking is to

295
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,480
look at the transition in a self- continuation in society

296
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,400
by looking at the influence of that person's

297
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:57,300
being up-to-date with our current relationship of interest and so these things affect me to that.

298
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,180
As I definitely factories are key to my success,

299
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,640
products are actually very techical.

300
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:10,140
It's usually an attraction of a man and an urge to move forward and to make something different at this point

301
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,460
something that has Widding Fists philosophy transport,

302
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,000
and a certain committee approach to be important.

303
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,020
At any point in time and in the future

304
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,260
of the United States, of the world community,

305
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,060
of the United States, of the world community,

306
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,060
and so on and so forth.

307
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,460
And I think that's how we really are.

308
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,420
So I think that's how we really are.

309
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,820
This is a very important issue for us.

310
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,980
Just to say that I think that some people

311
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,060
who are trying to figure out how to fix this,

312
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,900
how to fix this issue,

313
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,820
is that the people who are trying to fix this issue

314
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,820
and I think that's the best,

315
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,820
is that the people who are trying to fix this issue

316
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,940
are the ones who are the closest

317
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,620
to this thing that we're talking about.

318
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,020
So I think that's the best

319
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,020
and I think that's the best we can do.

320
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,940
Five years is the fastest we can do in two years.

321
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,340
And it's the fastest we can do in three years.

322
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,780
So we're going to do the fastest

323
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,020
if we're going to do the fastest if we're going to do that,

324
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:13,260
that way it's less scary about the death of the person.

325
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,020
And I think that's the best way

326
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,380
that we're going to fix this issue.

327
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,260
So I think this is a very important issue

328
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,100
especially for people who are trying to fix this issue.

329
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,740
And I think that's the fastest we can do.

330
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,540
And the fastest we can do is this.

331
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,980
So if once we've finished the process of fixing this,

332
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,820
so once we've finished the process of fixing this,

333
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,220
we're going to make the final step.

334
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,100
Once we've got the perfect piece of the puzzle,

335
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,900
and we're able to fix it,

336
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,060
we're going to be able to fix this

337
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,780
with a group of five relevant classes,

338
00:21:45,780 --> 00:22:11,960
which has a group of ten

339
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:21,280
This fails to be its specialty.

340
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,960
and for the future of the institution.

341
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,520
And the training that is going to start

342
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,160
is going to be very simple.

343
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,480
And what we really hope to do is to have

344
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,040
both the first six months of the process,

345
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,200
first six months of the training,

346
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,160
and then the second six months.

347
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,000
And that's it.

348
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,400
This is not the end of the first six months.

349
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,280
This is the first six months of the training.

350
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
This is the beginning of the training.

351
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,520
And the end of the training is the beginning of the first six months.

352
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,640
So I just want to follow up on what was really important

353
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,840
in the first six months for this training for us.

354
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,480
Let's say we want to start our final year

355
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,680
with a little bit of a break.

356
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,880
And it's pretty easy to start the training.

357
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,840
So we can actually start the training

358
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,160
with this, the coach will be in front of us.

359
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,880
And so we're going to go to the final round.

360
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,640
And then for the training, we're going to try

361
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,400
to demonstrate the other process.

362
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,720
And we're going to put these three exercises.

363
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,760
And we're going to try to get the best results

364
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,920
out of these two sets.

365
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,880
And so, one of the exercises is for the computer to practice

366
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:42,040
rather than just the exercise that we're going to do.

367
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,320
And again, the exercise, we show it to the drippers.

368
00:23:45,520 --> 00:24:03,980
Grasp the

369
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,280
you programm.

370
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,440
We excia to practice the technique.

371
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,000
And the last exercise here is done in the pitch.

372
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,200
and we put it in the same case.

373
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,800
It is a very interesting system.

374
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,080
Fundamentally, we claim to be some kind of self-sufficient

375
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,240
infrastructure.

376
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,680
But it's not true.

377
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,840
It means we're saying we're going to have to move forward.

378
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,880
There's no place for us to move forward.

379
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,000
One reason why we don't have a separate system

380
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,360
for this type of infrastructure is that it's not

381
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,400
a system with a focus on the data.

382
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,480
However, if we move forward, we're going to have to move forward.

383
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,960
And what we're going to have to do is that we're going to have

384
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,840
to move forward.

385
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,000
That's the next step.

386
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,320
The next step is that we're going to have to move forward.

387
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,200
And that's the next step.

388
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,840
And so what does that mean for us?

389
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,240
It's a place that they've created a situation

390
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,360
that is this infrastructure system.

391
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,360
And that's the next step.

392
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,480
And usually, we're talking about infrastructure systems.

393
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,560
So that's making sure that we're successful after all of it.

394
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,640
And we've got a lot of funds and situations

395
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,560
to put this infrastructure system in place.

396
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,080
And we've got a lot of infrastructure systems.

397
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,520
And we've got a lot of money.

398
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,680
And that's what we're going to have to move forward.

399
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,360
So we're going to have to move forward.

400
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,160
And that's the next step.

401
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,280
This is the next step.

402
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,800
And that's the next step.

403
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,280
So that's the next step.

404
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,920
And I'm going to move forward on the details a little bit.

405
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,600
And this is one of my favourite topics,

406
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,320
because I think it's very important,

407
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,160
and I think sadly we don't accessibility,

408
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,680
we don't have a minute limit when it comes to palms and fingers,

409
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,240
but they're very important,

410
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,000
but they help us with the accelerated development

411
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,080
and somebody having победism.

412
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,620
And you have to

413
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,040
that you watch out for something

414
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,040
For example, if you're supposed to be a lawyer,

415
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,040
what would you do if you had a criminal record

416
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,040
that was so strong that you had to stop

417
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
from getting this, this, this?

418
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,040
By the way, you might find that the fact is that

419
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
this is a fact.

420
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Because there are a lot of people who don't

421
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
know anything about this, and that's not

422
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
the point.

423
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Thank you for the best talk we've had.

424
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
I hope that you enjoyed this, and that it

425
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
was useful to you.

426
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,040
There was a quick question about the

427
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
fact that you had a criminal record.

428
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,040
I'm not sure that you ever got a criminal record

429
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
for this, but I think that's one of the

430
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,040
things that I think most of us should

431
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
consider.

432
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,040
To be honest, I think that's one of the

433
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,040
things that most people should consider

434
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
when they're talking about criminal record.

435
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,040
So, there are a lot of things that I think

436
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
that you should consider, so I'm going to

437
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
just give you a quick summary of what

438
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
I think you should consider.

439
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
I think that's the first thing that you should

440
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,040
consider when you're talking about criminal

441
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
record.

442
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,040
So, what I think you should consider is

443
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,040
that we have to think about criminal

444
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
record, and that's not something that

445
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
we should consider, because some of us

446
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
will think more about criminal record

447
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
than we think about these first

448
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
factors.

449
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,040
The first factor is criminal record.

450
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
That's the way that we should think

451
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
about criminal record.

452
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
So, we should be able to think about

453
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
influences, and if we're thinking

454
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
about the fact that it's a fact,

455
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,040
then we should think about it.

456
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
So, I'm going to give you a list of

457
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
first factors that you should consider.

458
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,040
If you're thinking about your

459
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,040
criminal record as much as you

460
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
are thinking about your experiences,

461
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,040
then there's the first factor that

462
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
you should consider.

463
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
First, what you should consider

464
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
when you're talking about criminal

465
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
record is that, as I said,

466
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,040
it's the way that we should think about

467
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
criminal record.

468
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,040
So, I'm going to give you a list of

469
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,040
things that you should consider when

470
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,040
you're talking about criminal record.

471
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
We have some questions.

472
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
So I'll just go to the questions.

473
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,040
And then I'll go to the answers.

474
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,040
So that's the answers.

475
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,040
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

476
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,040
Thank you.

477
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,040
That's it.

478
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
That's it.

479
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,040
That's it.

480
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,040
I'm interested in the questions.

481
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,040
I'm going to speak with the people

482
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
who want to give me some answers.

483
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
So that's the questions.

484
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,040
So that's the answers.

485
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,040
Thank you.

486
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,040
So that's the questions.

487
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
I'm going to speak with the people

488
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
who want to give me some answers.

489
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
I'm going to speak with the people

490
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,040
who want to give me some answers.

491
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,040
Thank you.

492
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,040
That's it.

493
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,040
That's it.

494
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,040
That's it.

495
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,040
Thank you.

496
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Thank you.

497
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
Thank you all.

498
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
We would like to thank all the people

499
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
who have given us this opportunity

500
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
to have a little bit of attention

501
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,040
because it's been so fantastic.

502
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,040
Thank you.

503
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
I'm going to run this question

504
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,040
for our students.

505
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
I'm going to give them a little bit

506
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
of discussion about what I think about

507
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,040
the potential outcomes that

508
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,040
exist within the social context

509
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,040
that we're talking about today.

510
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,040
So I'll start with the questions.

511
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,040
Thank you.

512
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Thank you all for speaking with us today.

513
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,040
I'm going to turn it over to

514
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,040
the students now.

515
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,040
I'm sorry if you're in the same

516
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
country as this witness.

517
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
This is what I'm going to

518
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,040
answer for the last three.

519
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,040
I hope that this sentence

520
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
is useful to all of you.

521
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,040
It's just a reminder that the

522
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
future is not going to be as simple

523
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,040
as it was in the past.

524
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
I'm going to say that's the

525
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,040
future of the system.

526
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
I know that you speak about

527
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
the future of social outcomes.

528
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,040
So thank you for your time today.

529
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,040
