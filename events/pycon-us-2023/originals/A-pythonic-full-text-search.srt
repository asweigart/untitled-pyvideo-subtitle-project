00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Good afternoon everybody, I'm Dr. Dixon, 55 A and C of the University of New York.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm Dr. Dixon, this presentation should be called a full text book, text books are way

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
more explicit than words, and I'm going to go over some of the other ways of doing full

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
text books, using stuff that you might not have heard of, and you can look at it in the

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,000
slides.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay, so text books are way more explicit in other words, nothing can be new and

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
ındanimesavioral, they're more explicit devilishly than real.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And text share wasangerous compared to real crowded text box.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now, text book wasangerous, it provides a lot of these special distinctions that

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,080
I also remember與ubut table.

11
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,160
We then had the discussion about what we should

12
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,120
do about our shortcoming and about how

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:45,960
to actually deliver or only how to deliver

14
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,960
was alsoDonald Trump, East Africa, the U.S., the United States

15
00:01:51,960 --> 00:02:02,040
and the United States in the editing of democratic

16
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:14,540
policy and Mitchell International

17
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,540
So, we can expect that since we have a lot of people,

18
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,540
we can see that there is a lot of people

19
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,540
that are in the same room as we are in the room,

20
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,540
so it's very important to understand that.

21
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,540
Thank you.

22
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,540
And now I would like to show a few things

23
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,540
that are important to understand about the concept of a customer.

24
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,540
I can show you a few things that are important

25
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,540
to understand about the concept of a customer.

26
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,540
These are all the examples that I've presented

27
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,540
and I'll show you some examples that you probably have

28
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,540
already seen.

29
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,540
So, I'm going to show you a few examples

30
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,540
that I've presented before and I'd like to show you

31
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,540
some examples that you've seen before.

32
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,540
So, let me just point out that

33
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,540
that's always been the case with the user

34
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,540
when it comes to the product.

35
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,540
This is a product that's taken

36
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,540
a very long time to produce,

37
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,540
and it's been very successful in the past.

38
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,540
There are three types,

39
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,540
storage and utilization,

40
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,540
there are three different examples that you can consider

41
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,540
and three examples that I've presented

42
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,540
particularly cheap fabric.

43
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,540
What's important for storage and utilization

44
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,540
is that customers always have understanding

45
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,540
and they sense the clearly characteristics

46
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,540
and clearly designs the customers.

47
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,540
And in missing sides, there are issues

48
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,540
as well as strategy that customers

49
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,540
form in terms of customer monumental clutch.

50
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,540
So, everyone has a platform

51
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,540
or specific product that they see it message

52
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,540
through which a customer can

53
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,220
has been respected.

54
00:03:41,700 --> 00:04:05,200
The여� A

55
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,460
It's like the ideal in the laboratory of school

56
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,700
where students commit perfect memorial to themed

57
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:18,500
for imperial subjects and

58
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:27,140
its way forward,

59
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,860
its style.

60
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,180
The original thing is we don't take up the term

61
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:42,000
and then outside of the major street Malaysia guy.

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,900
And of course, we can add a couple of little ions

63
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,360
that we call them 6-feet Virgin shotty

64
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,900
to give a grassroots female dresser

65
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,420
which she goes in a bottle of white absorbent

66
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,940
which she leaves nasze.

67
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,040
So, she's getting used to

68
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,220
and then dieses being all the way out

69
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,580
and the weights change as she gets this

70
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,840
so that she will be a bit more confident

71
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
in getting this and having the process

72
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
go more smoothly.

73
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,260
In the end of the day you can give her

74
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,700
6-feet's Virgin drink

75
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,700
and that's it.

76
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:15,600
which the

77
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:43,320
which the

78
00:05:45,600 --> 00:06:11,380
The

79
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,980
Mr Re 이렇게

80
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:20,080
Ach 만든

81
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:30,660
Dr

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,900
and if they're not.

85
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,600
And so there is no limit to

86
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,060
usto what I want the

87
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,820
we're working from

88
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,200
in, and I actually

89
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,900
have paid more that

90
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,220
with her step that

91
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,560
we're really working

92
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,300
and with helpless

93
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:10,920
what

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,300
we need to think what to have asillar

95
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,820
on there main redeployment

96
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,380
What of with your

97
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,300
think differently

98
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,140
while ideas of planning

99
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:56,040
But apart from that it's really necessary to see what the

ре mangeling enables it to就會 mission process by

101
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:11,300
In the first one's sim the computer law gave you a sense that,

102
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,760
clearly, this is a reference,

103
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,360
even data is vast,

104
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,480
for example, what if we에 that data were used on the wrong counting

105
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,680
on a unicorn

106
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:31,420
to create discrete

107
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,640
variables less than 10

108
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
and one that is a

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
We also propose

some of the

you'll just have three shipments

167
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,000
In result, we include rubber

It benefits your mission and explicitly names youribly those that will be Janet Baiz, that

177
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:35,460
And so Joachim, inEL HIS Microf Whoa, it makes a lot of sense.

178
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,200
That's kind of a good way of thinking.

179
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,800

180
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,580
Thanks again for the frequency.

181
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,760
Cuz they're awesome, and thanks again to pretty damn great

182
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,940
sessions it's been a blessing.

183
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,320
The actual presentation of this is really exciting

184
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,520
to me.

185
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,160
It's very, once again it's a film from the games

186
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,380
that we've been running.

187
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,500
And it's a very, very popular one.

188
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,320
And I loved it.

189
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,560
And it just delivered so much attention that just

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:45,660
that could be something else after theutter

214
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,660
gently.

215
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:56,160
After we have found resources under the Leadership Point Center, all that we need to think about

216
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,900
is how to entertainment assistance entrance audits and audits, turn rollers and business

217

But you may not see that often in olmas�es.

221
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,600
As far as inainter introduce, I put in place

forOK Today's point is flexible.

223
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,900
But if you guys want to be really fast

224
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,100
by saying Yza-Luzrade jumps out, who takes quiz?

225
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,340
I particularly talked about that 1960s morning.

226
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,520
One of the things I wanted to discuss with you about

227
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,120
is how types of Infoterawa and auto south

228
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,260
and expand auto south?

229
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,980
And the jack vaste ofçons Big Macs

230
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,380
is that a known

231
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,500
urban legacy.

00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,780
One of the values of prison is going to come intoomas

233
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,740
and implicitly it is major fax.

Somewhat different case for what appears to be at the since choose the most

239
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,820
I would you take a Suzanne time.

The bl青 group like it was with shaving,

245
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:43,260
I wish things would,

246
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,820
this arose, when genetics meant dramatic improvements

247
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,820
in human brains.

248
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,260

who have excellent thing,

261
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,720

264
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,940
And I'm really asking you have

been the fnu of the past,

266
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,160
just I've spent a crazy amount of time

267
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,260
I don't need all of them to bring you back

268
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,580
I'm gonna hear from everybody.

269
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,200
We agree.

270
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,820
And you and so much for all of

271
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,860
you before you have said nothing

272
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,740
I've realized that

273
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,040
would get in Alice's feet—

274
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:55,940
tested the

275
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,020
shot pinched,

276
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,100
stretched out,

277
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,900
held the standard,

278
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,580
and spoken for

279
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,800
suspend,

280
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,100
covering both

281
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:22,000
In order to diagnoshett these

282
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
dimensions, we possess multiple

283
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,800
ahnnings.

284
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:36,800
We are going to talk about one thing that is very important for the European Union.

285
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,800
It is the importance of the European Union as a country, but it is also important to

286
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,800
understand that the European Union is not a country of the European Union.

287
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
It is a country of the European Union.

288
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
And it is not a country of the European Union.

289
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
It is a country of the European Union.

290
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
And it is a country of the European Union.

291
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
And it is a country of the European Union.

292
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,800
This is a very important point.

293
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
And it is a country of the European Union.

294
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
And that is why we have some extra time for today.

295
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
We have some extra time to ask some questions.

296
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
I think it is a very important point.

297
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,800
We have to get a nice big review of the European Union's principles and principles.

298
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
It is important as well.

299
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,800
So, in the European Union, it is important to understand the European Union.

300
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,800
It is important to understand the European Union.

301
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
It is important to understand the European Union.

302
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,800
I think the important point is how the European Union is going to be able to

303
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
operate in the European Union.

304
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
And I think it is very important to understand that.

305
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,800
I think it is very important to understand that.

306
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,800
I think it is very important to understand that at the moment.

307
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,320
and that's what it was in 1986 when

308
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:00,640
an darum at the Trying Just to learn Mozilla 어

309
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,400
what is this were told

310
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,320
what so

311
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:36,080
Yeah.

312
00:22:42,320 --> 00:23:08,480
Of course

313
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,800
Thank you.

314
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,180
So if something needs to be global,

315
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,920
the safety keys are not just what's needed.

316
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,560
There's something that the military

317
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,000
would want to fix, so it's a very important thing.

318
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,680
This is the potential of the future.

319
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,920
The drug is a policy.

320
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,520
The policy of the future is the policy of the future.

321
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,960
And that's what we need to do.

322
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,920
We need to do what is needed to do.

323
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,320
We need to do what is needed to do.

324
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
And that's what we need to do.

325
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,680
And that's what we need to do.

326
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,920
And that's what I'm looking for with the current policies.

327
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,140
And the next stage is a major development

328
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,380
that must be tough.

329
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,440
And those thoughts then actually

330
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,160
need to be exploitationist, as you must assume,

331
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,200
or executionist.

332
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:36,980
And that's the

333
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,980
master planning and prevention typeGuide

334
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,740
If he and I could unite,

335
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:48,280
it would be better to hold on with coffee while he areas those.....

336
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,060
not to wrap might be one blame.

337
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,160
Why aren't we avoiding this??

338
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,780
Here again we have the tengan touch your body,
