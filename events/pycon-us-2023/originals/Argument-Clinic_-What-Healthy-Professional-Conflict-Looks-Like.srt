2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,280
And you say, can you shoot?

3
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,200
Can you?

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,000
I mean, shoot.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,080
Shoot.

6
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,800
But I feel like I should be able to open up

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,800
and see what's going on.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
I can't see anything.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
I can't see anything.

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,300
Hello.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,800
Hello.

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,300
Hello.

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:41,800
Hello.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,300
Hello.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:42,800
Hello.

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,300
Hello.

17
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:43,800
Hello.

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,300
Hello.

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:54,800
Hello.

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,800
Hello.

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,300
Hello.

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,300
I'm lost.

24
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:57,800
I'm lost.

25
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,300
Can you hear me?

26
00:00:59,300 --> 00:00:59,800
No.

27
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,300
I'm not sure.

28
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,700
I think we're going to switch to the physical.

29
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,100
It's something that is so common in the sense that it's

30
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:04,600
so complex.

31
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,300
There's no copy of the book in the book.

32
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,500
I have a 15.

33
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,500
But I'm not sure that it's the book.

34
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
I'm not sure what the book is.

35
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,500
It's the one that I'm just talking about.

36
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,500
I'm just talking about the one that I'm just talking about.

37
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500
It's going to try to explain it to you.

38
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
But it's going to try to explain it to you.

39
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,000
But I'm not sure.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,500
What?

41
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,000
Is it?

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, I guess it's going to try to explain it to you.

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,500
But what are you talking about?

44
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
I mean, you just forgot to give me a book.

45
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,200
It's the one that is so common.

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,700
Well, so if you know what happens,

47
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,100
I'll let the person answer for you.

48
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,600
This is a 20% chance.

49
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,500
It's going to be a lot of 50% of 50%.

50
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,200
It's going to be 50%.

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,900
You cannot answer for anything that's going to be in the book.

52
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,600
What's the point in having a 15%?

53
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,800
What's the point that you're just going to close the book?

54
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,700
What is it?

55
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,500
Do you think it's going to be a problem?

56
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,900
Are you going to close the book?

57
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,300
I mean, I think it's going to be a huge problem.

58
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, the one thing is the book is.

59
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,800
You're going to find something that's out of the book.

60
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,300
It's going to be a huge problem.

61
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,200
So we're going to open such a tool book that's on the rise.

62
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,560
We do a good job of looking at what's going to be the most

63
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,400
much-loved book for the future.

64
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,800
I think it's about time.

65
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Because it's the 20% of the book that you're going to close.

66
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,700
Yes, I do.

67
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,920
It was saying that Dr. Sartor, the Dr. Sartor working

68
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,800
for the TOR, took that 16% and I think that's about right.

69
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Dr. Sartor's written it.

70
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
That's right.

71
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
Whoa!

72
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,600
So is that how they go by name here?

73
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
It's the same term.

74
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,900
You need to see if that close box is over to the track.

75
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,000
I think that's the one.

76
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,900
Because you're talking about the things that stop you

77
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,400
from sourcing the book.

78
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,900
Whoa!

79
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,000
OK, hold on.

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,600
I'm just saying that you think that the writing of the book

81
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,000
doesn't have to be stored there.

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
This is the book.

83
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,600
OK.

84
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
It was that important.

85
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
I mean, I just need to get out of this one.

86
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,800
I'm not talking about a single conclusion.

87
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,400
Because I have now told you multiple times,

88
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
this is going to talk it out for each one.

89
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's a mess.

91
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Look, you can't have it both ways.

92
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,600
It's very difficult to get by it.

93
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
It's not going to be on our list.

94
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,800
This is my point of view.

95
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,500
I'm not wasting time on writing it.

96
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,800
You think this is a waste?

97
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,900
Of course it's a waste.

98
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,400
We've been doing all this for so long.

99
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,500
They took their money.

100
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
We've got it to make a focus on the bottom line.

101
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,900
And you're lost?

102
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,000
Do you think it's a waste of time?

103
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,900
It's really funny.

104
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,600
Look, you know, this might be a bunch of history,

105
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
but once you're in this company,

106
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,900
you don't really care about doing the right thing.

107
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,600
You're not just searching out the next quarter

108
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,400
and you're like, share one of our values.

109
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,000
You know, you care about getting involved,

110
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,900
and you think that there's way out there to get it done.

111
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,700
I mean, let's go.

112
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,400
You know the right thing.

113
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,200
Right up until you start to blame people off.

114
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,200
Do you just take the first?

115
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,200
What about you, you?

116
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,400
I wish I had continued to respect the sense of that.

117
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,600
It's not a waste of time.

118
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,700
I think it's a waste of time.

119
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,600
But I always get to think about the company

120
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,000
and say, of course, something like that.

121
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,500
Yeah.

122
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,620
Right.

123
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,300
Right.

124
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,060
Right.

125
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,300
Oh, good save.

126
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,700
That might have been a lot of money.

127
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,540
Yeah?

128
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,420
Just call it a day and get back to that last step.

129
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,820
But it's great that people join us.

130
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,500
Because it's nice that you feel safe,

131
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,500
you feel like you have the strength to show up and say,

132
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,400
OK, anybody's been released, and they're off separately?

133
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,700
Many people have been.

134
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,200
Great.

135
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,700
Yeah.

136
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,220
OK.

137
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,780
Thank you.

138
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,560
Thank you.

139
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,380
Thank you.

140
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,860
Thank you, honesty.

141
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,120
Joy.

142
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,820
Thank you.

143
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,340
Thank you.

144
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,500
What is it today?

145
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:49,420
slots,

146
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,020
and we wanted to start off with a quick question.

147
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,960
So, I think, last year, we were very proud of our job

148
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,020
team, and we've done a lot of work with the service.

149
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,060
And first of all, we're a team that

150
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,340
has done a lot of work with the service, and we're a team.

151
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,580
We're actually a team that's been working with the service

152
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,580
for a long time.

153
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,860
So it's really just been impressive.

154
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,300
It's like, just, you know, we've done a lot of work

155
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,260
with the service, that's been a lot of work with the service

156
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:17,760
for years.

157
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,500
And so we've done a lot of work with the service.

158
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,020
So I'm fixing something, but you're

159
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,140
saying that's not so that's what we're doing.

160
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,940
That's why we're talking about the service.

161
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,420
So I think, yeah, we've made a big difference in this.

162
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,300
And we've done a lot of work with the service.

163
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:30,820
That's right.

164
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,320
That's right.

165
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,780
Yeah, we've done a lot of work with the service.

166
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,940
And we're doing a lot of work.

167
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,460
Yeah.

168
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,300
Anyway, I think that's the best thing.

169
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,660
It's true that this is a team that has done a lot of work

170
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,780
and a lot of work together, and we're

171
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,580
able to do this for the service that helps us a lot.

172
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,820
It's pretty much true.

173
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,420
And we're able to get it out of the way.

174
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,100
We just put this to the top of the list.

175
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,820
So what is the best way to do it?

176
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,580
Not that it's not the best way.

177
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,260
There's a few things that we're going to do.

178
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,660
What are the best ways?

179
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,540
It could be that more of the service is working.

180
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,020
I mean, look, there's a lot of open-ended projects working.

181
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,740
Of course, there's a lot of things that are working.

182
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,180
It's not the only one.

183
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,260
The other thing that's going to happen is going to be

184
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,180
that we're going to be constantly

185
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,060
adopting these things.

186
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,100
And I'm sure that's going to be a change in this,

187
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,860
which I love.

188
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,100
And I think we're probably going to be able to do it

189
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,740
because it's really my biggest and my first project.

190
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,660
And I think it's going to be a great project.

191
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,740
But I think that's the ultimate direction of our

192
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,340
engagement, which is not to get everyone to work.

193
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,100
And I think that's the only thing that we're going to do

194
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,900
today because this is just the beginning

195
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,460
of something that's going to happen.

196
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,260
And I think that's turning out to be the perfect way

197
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,700
to close the gap between the two.

198
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,380
And that's what we're going to do.

199
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,660
Yeah.

200
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,540
So that's why I think the years that have been

201
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,620
turned into years and years.

202
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,420
What are you expecting to see?

203
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,700
It's going to be a lot of things.

204
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,220
And it's going to be a lot of proposals.

205
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,900
You understand what I mean?

206
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,260
Let's see.

207
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,420
Let's see what the different sides are.

208
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,420
So we're going to be able to do a lot of things.

209
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,780
But the time is going to be a lot of different things.

210
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,020
And really, it's going to be a lot of different things.

211
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,620
And we're going to be able to do a lot of things.

212
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,100
OK.

213
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,580
Let's see.

214
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,060
Let's see.

215
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,540
Let's see.

216
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,020
Let's see.

217
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,540
Let's see.

218
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,020
Let's see.

219
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,500
Let's see.

220
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,020
Let's see.

221
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,500
Let's see.

222
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,020
Let's see.

223
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,500
Let's see.

224
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,020
Let's see.

225
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,500
Let's see.

226
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,020
Let's see.

227
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,500
Let's see.

228
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,980
You know, if you're talking to us,

229
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,460
you know, we've done a lot of things.

230
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,420
We've just finished this.

231
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,340
You know, we went through it in two minutes and broke that

232
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,620
for a minute and a half.

233
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,020
We went through it through the upstream to the project

234
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,460
that we did because it was just the right thing.

235
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:37,980
Yeah.

236
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,780
And we're going to have a lot of overall resource

237
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,220
anyway, so.

238
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,220
But we're going to have to spend a lot of time on that.

239
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,980
And you know, if you're talking to us for a long time,

240
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,580
then we're going to have to be careful.

241
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,580
We're going to have to spend a lot of time on that.

242
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,380
So we've got to think.

243
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,580
Yeah, let's do it.

244
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,220
OK.

245
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:56,900
Class.

246
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,260
Class.

247
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,380
Classes.

248
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,020
And we're talking about the next class.

249
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,740
No, that's not what I meant.

250
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,180
But you're talking about the next class.

251
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,860
You're talking about the next class.

252
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,340
We're waiting for the next class.

253
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,420
No, that's what I meant.

254
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,420
Yeah, I know that we're talking about 100% complete

255
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,740
with the next class, but we've got to think about it.

256
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,780
But what if we just do it with the next class?

257
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,780
Would that be a good project?

258
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,500
Yeah, but the most important thing is that we're

259
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,460
going to have a lot of time to spend on that.

260
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,180
So it's important.

261
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,380
We're going to have to spend a lot of time on that.

262
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,340
And still with the next class, we're going to have to think

263
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,660
about what else we can do.

264
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,980
But we're going to understand why we did that.

265
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,980
When we decided to do that, we were going to have to think

266
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,100
about it.

267
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,580
So actually, I think it's about providing some kind of

268
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,100
response to the next class.

269
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,900
And then, this would be the end of 100%.

270
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,300
That's the answer we're going to need to get.

271
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,500
What's the next example?

272
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,300
It's the next one.

273
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,340
So it's going to be the next one.

274
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,260
So you're going to think that the next class, the next year

275
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,780
one class, the next year, the next year, the next year,

276
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,820
is going to be something that's going to be

277
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,300
something that's going to be presented.

278
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:25,860
So it's now 3D

279
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:32,020
Okay?

280
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:38,160
oh, that's OK smoke cesalases, go about it where ever you wanna go I'm just talking about you

281
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,440
but maybe look, at what your divorces that

282
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,200
even things with it's such weird things, when sometimes you just figure they're all gewd

283
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,460
look at the girl in a 임 vocical structure so close, you are telling me

284
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,240
and it's not starting form these things

285
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,460
beautifu, this is the body, I can take every little bit

286
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,140
its all just the same situation

287
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,340
water it

288
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:15,760
ᶯ ᶠᶦᶜᶦᶘᶦᶜ ᶦᶜ ᶠᶦᶔᶦᶦᶦᶘ ᶕᶦ⁰ᶦᶻ

289
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,560
Just look, what is he saying?

290
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,660
He's saying, he's saying, he's saying,

291
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,560
nobody is too trans-faceted.

292
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,360
Nobody is.

293
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,960
I'm just going to say, it's not that.

294
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,860
I'm just going to say, it's not that.

295
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,160
It is not that.

296
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,260
Just look at the way that they're evaluating things

297
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,660
like today.

298
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,660
Trying to go around looking for a different way.

299
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,960
They're going to find something else.

300
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,160
They're going to find something else.

301
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,360
It's not that.

302
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,460
It's not that.

303
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,260
It's not that.

304
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,060
Oh, no.

305
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,160
There's no exam of diversity.

306
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,460
So everybody says exactly that.

307
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,360
I don't know.

308
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,460
It's 조목ذا.

309
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,860
That's what he just means.

310
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,960
pajama jjresavingodibi chi cha parrot cis

311
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,860
Or that goes in every sentence.

312
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,860
That's right.

313
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,760
But the facts, or the fact is some people have one free

314
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,360
too 읽 the presented truth.

315
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,660
But what he's trying to say is,

316
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,960
actually that's not typical.

322
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,720
It's something that other people don't think of as an arrangement as well.

323
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,720
So that's what's, again, a very important thing that I'm working on.

324
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
The arrangement is a very important thing.

325
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,720
We're going to change it in the next couple of months, but it's very important.

326
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,720
So I'm going to say that that's important.

327
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,720
But now something for sure about this arrangement is that it's very important to do what we did with it.

328
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,720
It's a very important process.

329
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,720
I'm going to say it again, because I think it's very important.

330
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,720
It's a very important thing.

331
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
It's a very important thing.

332
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,720
So what do you think?

333
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,720
You're feeling it, isn't it?

334
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Somebody's feeling it, yeah.

335
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,720
And you're saying, well, it's a very important thing for me.

336
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
So it's definitely important that we change it.

337
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
It's very important.

338
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,720
I think it's important to do something that makes it more important for us.

339
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,720
So yes, something that's important.

340
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,720
So I think it's important to do something that makes it more important for us.

341
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:41,720
So, then the modernization process, that is so important, is a process that's very important.

342
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,720
So then you get to the point where you're going to do the process of changing it.

343
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,720
And then I mentioned that too, the process of setting up the next arrangement,

344
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
and then you're going to do the process of changing it.

345
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,720
So to start with, I'm going to do a few things.

346
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,720
Something different, something different from what you're talking about.

347
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
I'm going to do a few things.

348
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,720
So, I'm going to do a few things.

349
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
I'm going to do a few things.

350
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
It's a very important work.

351
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:27,720
And I want to make sure that most of the people who are talking about making changes to the changes that are going to be made today,

352
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,720
they're not just looking at the changes around the world, but more importantly,

353
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
I'm going to tell them that my wishes are just for them to be reality.

354
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,220
That is what I wish for them to be, to be about to syel something different,

355
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,220
However, the last one is on view.

356
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,620
That's what I think about for this whole paper.

357
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Could you just repeat that one?

358
00:13:46,720 --> 00:14:11,560
and their

359
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
locals.

360
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,860
Yeah.

361
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,980
There have been weeks.

362
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,660
Because we have an English uns Tucker Varga that

363
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,420
golfers don't usually know the language.

364
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,980
What do you think of the

365
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,220
culture of Cherry Garden remodeling for women?

366
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,320
There isn't a place like that in 20 or 201,

367
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,620
so people should know what that means,

368
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:46,420
Do it now quickly and quickly would you.

369
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,060
You must havepalest 갔을 Namely Conservative Party???

370
00:14:51,060 --> 00:15:11,000
about the fahrenheit mechanics that are in action today.

371
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,340
That is important.

372
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,140
And, generally, the EU has always been technology evidence to fight against global warming.

373
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,800
And at

374
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,620
I would have estimated

375
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,720
I think是

376
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,040
but how and what that means and how different it is?

377
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,880
And then when we talk about learning what kind of

378
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,900
opportunities are you Good morning good morning

379
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,760
All right, good morning.

380
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,620
My name is Jennifer Remus and I'm the director of

381
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,000
the thing called Changeable ranches for you right

382
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,760
now it's a true video that looks like it.

383
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,400
And a lot of them are the questions we always ask the

384
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,440
host on YouTube so is that so you're fire support

385
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,040
And it's really going so far as to say, you know,

386
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,240
I'm a scholar, I'm a historian, I'm a commissioner,

387
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,040
I'm a scientist.

388
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,080
So the shared way of thinking about that is, well,

389
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,040
you thought that the way you thought

390
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,480
was not going to be the way it was going to be.

391
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,680
And so that's not it.

392
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,680
And it's not the way it was going to be.

393
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,680
And that was the way it was going to be.

394
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,560
But I think that's the way it was going to be.

395
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,040
So the way it was going to be is that way.

396
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,200
And that's the way it was going to be.

397
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,400
You know, if you think about it, you

398
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,600
thought about it every time you think about it.

399
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,640
So you want to say, well, this is really good.

400
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,760
You thought this was your choice.

401
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,160
But you're not going to say, well,

402
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,720
this is really not the way it was going to be.

403
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,120
Particularly, you need to think about this.

404
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,560
You're really definitely going to be able to see that.

405
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,960
That doesn't work well too much.

406
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,440
And some of that's what they don't want to think.

407
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,240
It works well, but you don't need to be able to think.

408
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,520
And that's the thing.

409
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,600
You must be exactly the same.

410
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,320
And that's what we need to think about.

411
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,480
Because the opposite is true.

412
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,400
And that's the difference that's going to be

413
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,920
if you're going to think about it,

414
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,800
you're going to be able to think about it.

415
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,680
Just like right here.

416
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,760
So you're going to get out of the way.

417
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,240
So you're going to be in a situation

418
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,440
that there's no way.

419
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,000
But the way it works is, well, that's where it works.

420
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
So that's the question.

421
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,080
So that's the problem.

422
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,760
So maybe I understand why.

423
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,640
It's about the most important thing.

424
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,760
Because it's better for the farmers.

425
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,480
I don't know if it's the farmers.

426
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,600
But the more interesting I think of it is,

427
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,440
it's about the farmers.

428
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,120
It's about the farmers.

429
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,840
How do we do it?

430
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,240
We don't want to have a very nice family.

431
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,000
So it's true.

432
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,280
It's true.

433
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,960
But I think the problem is,

434
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,800
what's the problem?

435
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,000
It's much more important.

436
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,520
Right?

437
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,000
Why do you generally just want so much

438
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,080
of the right thing?

439
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,320
It's usually right.

440
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,800
Like, the real industry is not good.

441
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,360
The balance is not only about the company.

442
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,000
The origin is the entity.

443
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,720
Now speaking of the core of the question,

444
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,120
I want to ask all of you this morning.

445
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,600
I want to ask the audience.

446
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,440
I want to ask the audience about the position

447
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,400
of the farmers in the United States.

448
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Thank you.

449
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,520
Thanks.

450
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,040
And I'll say, I'm not just saying that.

451
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,640
I do feel like the most interesting part of it

452
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,320
is the fact that the U.S. government

453
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,400
is really doing a good job of that.

454
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,680
So here's what I want to say.

455
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,640
The U.S. government is doing a great job.

456
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,160
I would say that they're a different thing,

457
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,480
but in this country, they are well.

458
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,240
Mr. Anderson, what's the question?

459
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,160
That's pretty easy.

460
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,440
You know, it's like, it's like,

461
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,280
don't worry too much.

462
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,720
There are people who are going to pay this much.

463
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,920
So you just want to do just the same thing.

464
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,160
But I want to touch on what they're doing today.

465
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,080
I mean, they're doing a lot of work.

466
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,040
So if you think about it, the federal government

467
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,760
is now in a position where they have no...

468
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:11,620
What is the useful, I guess,

469
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,160
viable, issues about this?

470
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:24,080
It seems, you know, that we shouldn't just

471
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,700
ceksus idiotic or the

472
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:36,460
ALLY

473
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:49,820
you have

474
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,100
your

475
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,760
alphabetinica

476
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,300
is

477
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,100
So this is a question that we need to look at too.

478
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,100
So, you know, this is a question that we need to work on something.

479
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,100
So, you know, the future of this business,

480
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,100
you know, it's a question that's very, very important.

481
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,100
Yeah, I thought that.

482
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,100
Okay, so what is often used for business,

483
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,100
which is the case of twice as many people as large,

484
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,100
not just the employment number, but whether,

485
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,100
of course, there's also some success,

486
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,100
but also the success of the company,

487
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,100
the revenue of the company,

488
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,100
the income of the company,

489
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,100
the income of the company.

490
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,100
So what is the benefit of this business?

491
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,100
The revenue of the company is much better.

492
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,100
Why? And where?

493
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,100
What is the benefit of this business?

494
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,100
And what is the benefit of this business?

495
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,100
Okay.

496
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,100
Okay.

497
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,100
So, the benefit of this business is,

498
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,100
you know, the revenue of the company is much better.

499
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,100
And the profit is much better.

500
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,100
And the profit is much better.

501
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,100
So, what is the benefit of this business?

502
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,100
The benefit of this business is much better.

503
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,100
Okay.

504
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,100
So, what is the benefit of this business?

505
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,100
The benefit of this business is much better.

506
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,100
Look, that's like a good answer.

507
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,100
It's a good answer.

508
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,100
It's a good answer. It's very good.

509
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,100
So, sometimes I'm trying to think that way.

510
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,100
You know, I think it's very natural

511
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,100
that you're going to be trying to think that way.

512
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,100
It's a good answer.

513
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,100
You know, I'm totally just going to go straight to the point,

514
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,100
but I'm sorry if I'm not saying that.

515
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,100
Okay.

516
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,100
For those of you who don't know what the benefits of this business

517
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,100
are, you know, what your life is like, then what your future looks like.

518
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,100
A lot of the benefits of this business are, you know,

519
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,100
so much better than what you're going to be doing.

520
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,100
So, what are the benefits?

521
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,100
You know, it's a good answer.

522
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,100
You know, you're not going to be able to do this right away.

523
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,100
Because it's a short term.

524
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,100
It's a real connecting source of self- κάνitonation.

525
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,100
So, one of the elements in this business

526
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,100
is there's a Everything bong train.

527
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:59,560
If you are doing a weight

528
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:07,100
or a platform, I'm very much in control of the whole financial system.

529
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,740
You've換

530
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,740
okay

531
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:25,220
which

532
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,580
is

533
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:33,140
uh

534
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,500
I think that's one of the things that I'm trying to say.

535
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,340
But finally, I think that's one of the things that I'm trying

536
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,420
to say.

537
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,000
But I think that's a great question, though.

538
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,820
But next, you are just not sure whether to abandon

539
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,380
the two of you.

540
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,780
I would like to be able to say that in terms of what

541
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,100
we understand about the two of you,

542
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,780
both of you have been through a lot.

543
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,340
And I think that you are very, very interesting.

544
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:04,380
Both of you have been through a lot.

545
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,700
One of the things that you have been through

546
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,020
for this entire time, because I know what the other team knows

547
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,860
when we talk about the two of you.

548
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,820
One of you has been through a lot.

549
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,820
But I think that's one of the things that you have been through.

550
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,580
Then you have to be able to understand

551
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,580
the two of you.

552
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,700
And I think that's a great question.

553
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,620
So, Tom, I have a question for you.

554
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,900
Maybe you thought that you were going to accept this.

555
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,300
This is really a great question.

556
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,620
I think that's a great question.

557
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:44,220
But do you just think that you are going to accept this?

558
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,620
That would be a great question.

559
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,660
I think that's a great question.

560
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,740
I think that's a great question.

561
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,660
But I feel that if you think about it,

562
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,180
when it comes to the two of you, you are not going to accept this.

563
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,980
I think that's a great question.

564
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,540
You are not going to accept this.

565
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,380
No.

566
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,140
But you know that.

567
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,520
So, well, not going to accept it.

568
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,660
You have to let your own opinion.

569
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,740
And I'm just going to say that this one of you

570
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,900
is going to be a good person.

571
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,100
And I'm just going to say that.

572
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,740
But I think that's a great question.

573
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,020
I think that's a great question.

574
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,540
I think that's a great question.

575
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,060
There are other things that I think.

576
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,580
I think that's a great question.

577
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,420
I think that is not just one thing.

578
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,420
I mean, not just something that's true.

579
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,300
It's not just one thing.

580
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,780
It's also like, you know, all of these concepts

581
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,340
are just things that are just like things.

582
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,300
But there are four ideas that are

583
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,900
just going to be the best things that you can do.

584
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,020
Then what's going to be the one that's going to be the best?

585
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,220
So I think that's a great question.

586
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,580
I think that's a great question.

587
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,620
And, David, it is hard to tell this from what you have said.

588
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,340
I think that's a great question.

589
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:52,860
OK.

590
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,820
That Bob response is going to be a great thing.

591
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,860
Bob is a great person.

592
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,660
He's a great guy.

593
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,420
I think he's a great person.

594
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,420
So that's my question to you, David.

595
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,260
So what are your thoughts on this?

596
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,660
I think that's a great question.

597
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,500
OK, so that's a great question.

598
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,980
We don't have to go through all the answers,

599
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,580
but we have to go through the answers.

600
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,100
So you're going to have to think about that.

601
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,420
That's a great question.

602
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,100
I think that's a great question.

603
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,860
How do you know what the answer is?

604
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,500
I guess just from his face.

605
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,700
So can I have an idea?

606
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,460
I'm just going to go through some of the answers.

607
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,340
I think that's a great question.

608
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,060
I think that's a great question.

609
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,220
I'd like to go through some of the answers.

610
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,260
I think that's a great question.

611
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,300
I would like to know what you think of this.

612
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,020
There's a lot of groundless questions.

613
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,580
Thanks, Bob.

614
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,540
You're very good at talking about things.

615
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,260
Thank you.

616
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,660
Thank you.

617
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,140
I think Bob's response was, you know,

618
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,320
it's hard to say what he thinks of it.

619
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,940
It's kind of a story for me.

620
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,620
I think it's a story.

621
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,940
What were hisелиas.

622
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,720
He was saying his一下 that I couldn't say so

623
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,740
when I was first approaching it.

624
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,220
Before he said that, what were you saying?

625
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,980
Come on, what was that?

626
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,540
Is he talking about what his establishes do?

627
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:10,780
He's saying that your family's roughly 1 in 10 families.

628
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:15,880
He's quite the self-膨 viktigt to what you're saying.

629
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,780
They might also how many months to wait.

630
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,780
I think we can't just say that's not true.

631
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,780
I think we can't really think that way.

632
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,780
I think James probably just thinks that's not true.

633
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,780
And we need to think that way.

634
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,780
We need to think that way.

635
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,780
That's the question.

636
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,780
So I think that is the question.

637
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,780
Yes, and you are right.

638
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,780
We need to think that way.

639
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,780
And I think that's the question.

640
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,780
So back to the topic.

641
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,780
Do you think we're glad that we have the first favorite robot in the country?

642
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,780
Do you think we were glad to have the first favorite robot in the country?

643
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,780
I don't know.

644
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,780
Would you agree that we're being blessed with a first-ever robot in the country?

645
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,780
Yes, but isn't it the future, not something new?

646
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:16,780
Oh, great, that would be so great because we can start, obviously, by making some research and research on it.

647
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,780
Making some research on it upstream regularly, like we used to do, right?

648
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,780
Or we can get to the next level, too, looking for some new research.

649
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,780
I think we can get one that we do also try to do some research on.

650
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,780
That's actually a good thing.

651
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,780
We can do a research on the first-ever robot.

652
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,780
I mean, I would say it's more like a very new-age robot.

653
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,780
I mean, it's very modern, it's quite new.

654
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,780
It's very, very new.

655
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,780
So, yes.

656
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,780
So we go to the question.

657
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,780
So that's the question.

658
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,780
What about the lion?

659
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,780
We see the lions pretty din.

660
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,780
Were the lions really far away?

661
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,780
That's quite a distance, isn't it?

662
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,780
That's pretty far away.

663
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,780
Do you see the lion?

664
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,780
That's too far away, too far away.

665
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,780
Yes, it's a big impose.

666
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,780
Well, that's good.

667
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,780
It's the'refight, the'refight is an Covid Prayer.

668
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:17,980
