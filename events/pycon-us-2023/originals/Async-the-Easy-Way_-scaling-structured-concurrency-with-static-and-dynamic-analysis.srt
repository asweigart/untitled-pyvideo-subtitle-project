1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
and more information onto the education system.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,720
Like, I would rather junta

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,180
be considered as a social leurs

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,480
when part of the population

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,120
being raised teacher for schools

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,320
or in terms of children

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,060
and their economic analysis

8
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,060
than the 부분 which I've been Droweing

9
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,860
So, so...

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,860
So again, I feel that

11
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,740
there does need to be some

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,540
support to further

13
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,740
education and social talking

14
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:42,660
We feel that the

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,540
state

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:01:13,580
as part of the continued action to present the

00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,100
SH

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,320
shed

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,040
don't

28
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,700
the

29
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,560
it

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
from

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,320
This kind of problem is not only in the mainstream,

32
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,680
but in the system, whether it was being watched

33
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,320
by the Western people.

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,040
So it's a real problem, it's a real problem,

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,520
and it's a real problem because it's

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,520
a service that is not being asked to do.

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,560
It's a significant advantage for the touch base

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,520
because it allows for better targeting of the public.

39
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,960
It's a significant, it's a reason, it's a big ability,

40
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,040
for the public to serve in many places.

41
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,240
It's a significant advantage for the public

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,280
to be able to get in and out of the work.

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,840
It's a real advantage because it's a service

44
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,440
that's not being asked to do.

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,360
It's a real advantage for the public.

46
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,240
And that's the reason why the data,

47
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,320
the data that's being collected,

48
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,960
it's all about the service.

49
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,640
It's a big benefit.

50
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,080
It's a significant advantage.

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,080
The Asian clouds, they are the most important thing for me.

52
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,200
It's a significant advantage.

53
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,000
It's a big benefit for the system,

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,240
a message to improve the data that's being sent

55
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,880
to the global state service.

56
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,520
It's a crucial service, it's a very important one.

57
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,000
It's a significant benefit, it's a big benefit for the public.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,520
It's a significant benefit for the world.

59
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,960
It's a significant benefit for the species.

60
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,680
It's a big advantage.

61
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,760
You can't buy a computer, it's just a little bit of a pain in the ass.

62
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,960
It's a significant advantage.

63
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,960
It's a significant advantage.

64
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,320
It's a huge benefit.

65
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,280
It's a significant benefit for the world.

66
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,720
It's a great advantage.

67
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,080
It's a very significant benefit.

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,000
And so it's a significant advantage for the world.

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,200
So it's a big benefit.

70
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,360
It's a shame.

71
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,600
It's a shame because it's so important.

72
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,440
And honestly, it's a big mistake.

73
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,440
It's a big one, but also a shame.

74
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,480
I think I might be right to say that for some of the most

75
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,280
significant reasons,

76
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,120
but I'm not sure that the next steps

77
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,280
that we're going to take from the world.

78
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,440
I think that the next steps that we're going to take from the world

79
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,160
is the strategy.

80
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,160
The strategy is to make the most of the opportunity.

81
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,560
So this is a significant one for the future.

82
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,680
And it's especially important for the species

83
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,520
that we're going to be taking steps in

84
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,560
and what kinds of ways to take them up.

85
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,080
So the policy is to make the most of the circumstances

86
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,640
and to make the most of the better workers.

87
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,240
And so we're going to be doing this in a very

88
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,600
very serious and very very serious period

89
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,000
and we're going to be doing this with a lot of focus and focus.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,880
I'm going to take this from the science of technology,

91
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,440
which is a very big,

92
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,160
a very big, very important step in science.

93
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a very big, very important step.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,480
This is a significant one.

95
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,120
So this is a significant one.

96
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,760
So this is a very big,

97
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,120
a big step in the development of the world.

98
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,440
And this is a very big one for the future.

99
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,200
This is a very big step for the future.

100
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,560
And that's why I'm going to take this from the science

101
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,520
and the science and the science.

102
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,360
So this is a very big step for the future.

103
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,120
And now that I've been talking to you,

104
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,600
I just want to say a few words about it.

105
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,920
It's nice to talk about reconnecting

106
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,980
to push yourself onto the world's

107
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,440
textbooks andší the boldness

108
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,480
of bringing back the science

109
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:07,760
to enable them for influence

110
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,920
to enable them for influence

111
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,080
to help them family.

112
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,020
But it's a very models of how we can

113
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,080
travel their path together

114
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,620
when we can't find another way

115
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,760
of Narrator from what primary development

116
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,960
Ren terrorism remains the kind of

117
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,600
that I need to make them admit to it.

118
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,820
The first thing is that I can apply my psychology to all of the things

119
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,080
that I want to ingest, the things that I'm not afraid of,

120
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,640
things that I think shouldn't be tried without visitors 좋아하기 inaugurиров facial expressions

121
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,520
And we've won everything we know about these things for fear that they try to belittle us again and again.

122
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,700
Soさинг clarify

123
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,920
Start my business

124
00:05:48,920 --> 00:06:17,940
in ...

125
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,780
the efficient approach in the form of endottochenesis,

126
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,020
and the 안녕하세요, and todation hypothesis,

127
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:43,420
the

128
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:49,420
It is normal to tell you the first question, because I try not to tell you the third one,

129
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,420
but you play around with it, because, like I said, If I were you I would tell you one or

130
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,420
the third one, but, when you play around with it, you play it really beautiful, because

131
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,420
I play with it a lot, like online communicate with you.

132
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:08,420
Some players cumin this ever research video or I play about with them and the other player

133
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,420
would hit that knowledge 하는 에브 수조ёлา, and they do indeed.

134
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:18,220
But we decided to go with the face-to-face basis

135
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,120
because that is the problem.

136
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,920
The problem is, first and foremost,

137
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
that when you get sourced into a multinational,

138
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,420
you are then underused.

139
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,820
Then you are abused.

140
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,940
And I had strategy to be receiving

141
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:41,840
this type of WuYi from Alexa one day.

142
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,340
but there is a good balance between the basic and the current.

143
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,960
Whether we need to set a specific interest,

144
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,960
either we can set the full risk or we can set the specific

145
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,360
candidate, and we can set the risk for one of each other,

146
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,560
but we also need to set the risk.

147
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,440
And so, how does this work?

148
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,240
The first thing we do is we set the risk,

149
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,740
we can set the risk for the second,

150
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,940
we can set the risk for the third,

151
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,060
we can set the risk for the fourth,

152
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,160
and we can set the risk for the fifth.

153
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,940
And we can set the risk.

154
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,400
A specific element for action is a viability chamber use

155
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,740
when the task is contributed,

156
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,000
and the whole itself ispot 저도 himself to stick

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:34,440
and are some of the bones from the

158
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:54,200
N stuffing leave the

159
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,500
It is significant and is critical to the development of a safe,

160
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,500
independent stayed мон tamanho,

161
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,160
to the reproduction of the micro КYs

162
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,400
and also to sustainability.

163
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,880
The following village comes under the wash of J 만

164
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,760
and the valid is not accepted

165
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,440
the flow of work from which the Hence we spend

166
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:33,000
Theycied it out and it busily went in禁止為了

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,640
As you can see in the previous report for the Soviet Party,

168
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,220
we're gonna go into detail.

169
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:57,840
So I put it in

170
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,840
but also the way we think.

171
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,840
So, to explain the second thing,

172
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,840
I think it's easy to just say that

173
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,840
we're not going to be able to do this alone.

174
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
This is a way of thinking.

175
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,840
This is a way of thinking.

176
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
This is a way of thinking.

177
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,840
And this is a way of thinking that

178
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
we are going to be able to do this alone.

179
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,840
We are going to be able to do this

180
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
by taking this way of thinking.

181
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,840
If you want to take the risk

182
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
of a current cost,

183
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
but you can't avoid starting stocks

184
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
and you're not going to find a solution

185
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
for your expenses,

186
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
this is a way of thinking.

187
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
This is a way of thinking that

188
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
you can take for a swim.

189
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,840
You can take a swim and you're going to

190
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,840
find a solution to your cost.

191
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
If you're showing a current cost,

192
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,840
then you don't have to take the current cost.

193
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,840
You can take a risk of a current situation.

194
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,840
You can take a risk of a current event.

195
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
But if you're taking a risk of a current

196
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,840
situation, which is a very, very big problem,

197
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840
then you're going to have to ask a

198
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,840
lawyer to fix it for you.

199
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Which, most of the time, is a big problem.

200
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
But we're going to make this a

201
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
very special event in the next few years.

202
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
And it's possible.

203
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
It's possible.

204
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
It's possible that you can't

205
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
do this alone.

206
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,840
It's also difficult.

207
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
And I think that we're going to have to

208
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
take this seriously.

209
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
And I think we're going to have to

210
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,840
do everything we can to do this.

211
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
I would like to talk about this.

212
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
This is a very, very difficult

213
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
issue.

214
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,160
You can take risk of

215
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,840
an event that was cut past.

216
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840
You can take out a large amount of

217
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Bundle file for space monitoring.

218
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,140
And once you do, we guage that

219
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,840
level of traceability through

220
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,840
the merging copy of the search

221
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,840
memory app of the su Castle.

222
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Now, we will give naming

223
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
to the boys Austin Israel who

224
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,840
are the best in the folder.

225
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Ask the boys and they'll say,

226
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
you didn't figure that out.

227
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
But I'm still not sure you can accept it.

228
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,840
We need to talk about the things we can still accept.

229
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Everything is the same.

230
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
There is quite a few things here.

231
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,840
All of the things that are changing,

232
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,840
we call them the best and the worst.

233
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,840
If you're thinking,

234
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,840
if you're thinking about the things that are changing,

235
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,840
well, maybe you're not going to be surprised

236
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
but this is the best for example.

237
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,840
So if this is the best thing that's going on

238
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
for you, I'd like to be the worst for example.

239
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
But for me, yes, there's a lot of good parts

240
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,920
that you'd like for it.

241
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
If I'm mean as a person,

242
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,380
these are some things that can be lighthouses

243
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:37,400
that you can work as

244
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,200
as materials,

245
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,900
but they aren't the best thing to be easier to use.

246
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,140
and you can do it for a long time.

247
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,180
If you are not able to do it, you can change the context

248
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,580
or you can not script.

249
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,740
You know what I mean?

250
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,500
And this is something that gets really interesting

251
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,420
as you speak to people who turn up.

252
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,900
And the way that you do it is actually

253
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,940
basically the same way that you do it,

254
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,780
you can make a first step in your journey,

255
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,140
just as you are doing it, and you're doing it the same time,

256
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,580
and it's just so fun to do it.

257
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,700
And so what I want you to do

258
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,700
is you want to do this, and you want to do this,

259
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,860
and you want to do that.

260
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,740
If you havesighs orラ

261
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,820
you've to laugh.

262
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,340
As you reess on that so that everything is

263
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,820
the circle of figure!

264
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,900
Music will always be your excuse!

265
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,340
If you are losing is you have

266
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,780
so I am just letting you laugh,

267
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,980
and that is enough, not work,

268
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,980
I am tough,

269
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,900
you already partners with unsure students.

270
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:52,920
and after the休 Olivier congress during October the 24th of the mistery.

271
00:13:52,920 --> 00:14:03,220
The two signatories, in March and April,

272
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,960
are welcomed with a special discharge from their poop예l rigues

273
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,380
and jewels.

274
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,020
For whenever, of course.

275
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,680
Yes.

276
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,460
He's very stream- Sacred, nothing bad.

277
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,980
Right.

278
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:40,660
because now aesthetic and

279
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,660
in seconds

280
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,660
if I now have the advantage

281
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,660
of having

282
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,660
to keep

283
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,660
out front

284
00:14:46,660 --> 00:15:01,660
on my

285
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:06,660
night

286
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,760
This has taken about five seconds.

287
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,840
That said I'm still retired.

288
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:31,980
But this en Confederative

289
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,300
is somehow Baltimore dot dancing in Bombayamatian north sie васlua.

290
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,440
Here is a person coming in to the nearby church

291
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,460
and reading a few words from building walls.

292
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,620
They couldn't be Ooooh the speech came to days

293
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,900
by time the people outside the building

294
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,740
out west got back to school.

295
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,440
Here they decided by that time the people won't be

296
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,580
necessary as opposed to 13.5 from their home Pure 추가an

297
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,560
Could be again No sketches at was admiration

298
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,740
that had got a round the most

299
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,480
that incarcer pill to pick up

300
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,820
anyone passing to dogs

301
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,960
who can't see the destroyer.

302
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,780
He was relegated to the training craft

303
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,900
very difficult course, to understand.

304
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,380
And that's why, for decades,處亞多人會在畸 Busan,

305
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,880
we are living in 2012,

306
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,000
the finaled approach,

307
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,360
and that is a different texture.

308
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,900
comicBook,

309
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,720
見面,

310
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,500
we endure

311
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,140
it as,

312
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,480
it's a submit,

313
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,200
and

314
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,040
the

315
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,160
and

316
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,180
The

317
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,540
and

318
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,720
and

319
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,960
and

320
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,160
across

321
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,780
a

322
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,560
an

323
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,080
an

324
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,160
artist

325
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
tower

326
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,140
and that actually he had no permanent threat fromizo

327
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:19,060
to make the

328
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,960
But when we chain you from these different schools.

329
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:33,260
With no

330
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,320
plans.

331
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,480
So, basically thinking from time to time,

332
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,600
about everything we face,

333
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,200
like what fact experience does people look at

334
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,940
the diagnosis symbols of ph penetrate.

335
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,080
Because when I grove in areas

336
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,040
that are not research boomed to get my

337
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,300
blueberries and tried to make exos Bash attracton.

338
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,740
I would follow what Dr. Anuel de Girlie

339
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,860
found in充l reports and said I guess

340
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
what does Terry think he will?

341
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,040
awesome, easy

342
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,500
so they had been holders of public support

343
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,220
Joudes were the last nuclear succubists

344
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,320
obligation

345
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:28,380
tailor-made

346
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:45,780
We don't need those lines because it doesn't make sense.

347
00:18:45,780 --> 00:19:01,620
It's still a一個字 modify enough to quite thing, so the general feeling is that the

348
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,900
In this way, it can take up in something far more implementable seconds it ole withese

349
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,460
time or another 다른 damping rate compared with other gases

350
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,940
and in that way we're ensuring that there is enough freedom that it stores time for

351
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,160
other lottery hesitant ejercins.

352
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:23,780
We would be able to say that we just support ourisItalian fertilization FE CLI now

353
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:29,620
is getting this a lot ofuck but I'm excited to show you some of this

354
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,200
We're kind.

355
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,760
But then we have freedom and a personal desire

356
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,020
to accomplish what we can, community church.

357
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,580
We have all the time just to reference our church life,

358
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,740
to our cathedrals of worship, to ourues of worship,

359
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,180
who are actually our church leaders,

360
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,500
we have everything to honor theıyla andao

361
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,160
give people spiritual help.

362
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,380
assembled in the church.

363
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,780
This doesn't have to hold down the principles
