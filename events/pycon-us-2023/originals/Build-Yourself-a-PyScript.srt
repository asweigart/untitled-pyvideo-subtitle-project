1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm going to try to get a little bit of a sense of the

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
context of the conversation.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So, the first thing is, what is the difference between

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the two of you?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So, the first thing is, what is the difference between

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the two of you?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, the first thing is, what is the difference between

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the two of you?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, the first thing is, what is the difference between

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the two of you?

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So, the first thing is, what is the difference between

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
the two of you?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So, the first thing is, what is the difference between

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the two of you?

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Thank you.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And I would like to follow up on the kitty

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
things I got from using evidence permission.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So, you got the facts on the table here?

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Wait one sec.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
First of all, we are very», first in the

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
ones that I talked about earlier the people that

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Thank you so much.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Thanks to you, you've been a great support team.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Thank you to everyone who has been a great support team.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Thank you.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So, welcome, Nekola, to the stage.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Thank you.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Thank you.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thank you.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Thank you.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Thank you.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Thank you.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Thank you.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Thank you.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,040
Now, I would also like to say that,

36
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,500
when it was aboutев going into the

37
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,020
Our truc deילו which we did some

38
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,440
What were the assumptions?

39
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,700
What was written?

40
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,900
What was runs down?

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,980
What was written?

42
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,100
The original week specifically,

43
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,260
is what we'll talk rn,

44
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,500
sorry, this is my patreon.

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,540
So, when Greg loves your stuff,

46
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,760
when Greg is a king,

47
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,060
he makes crazy talks

48
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,360
with the workers from that time,

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,860
talking about great stuff in those days,

50
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,760
that Yesterday Still Marks,

51
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,900
at times.

52
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,660
He loves your games very much this week,

53
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,740
I was father to the kids.

54
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,060
I was 3 friends in that one of the lessons

55
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,380
is always love your games.

56
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,180
being at the table, and we are just going to talk

57
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,800
about true

58
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,460
mayo, we are just going to talk about

59
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,900
shipping work and streaming

60
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,940
flashy things

61
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,700
Can we anyetric to become some practice before we webinars

62
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,500
and maybe�m comprehend

63
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,500
It's also an adventure to make a big change in the future.

64
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
It's a big step.

65
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
It's a big step in all of our dreams.

66
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,500
I mean, we've got all the energy of several sets of people in the studio.

67
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Yes, it's a dream.

68
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
It's a big step.

69
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,500
And why is it important to be ready for a lot of really important things that we can take advantage of?

70
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
And it's also a very interesting work.

71
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:59,500
I mean, the fact that we're even in a conversation, we might get reminded that we know that the performance doesn't just worry about the actual thing.

72
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,500
But we're also aware that the students are basically being there for the first time.

73
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Why is it that we're seeing them in that kind of space?

74
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
I mean, it's a big step.

75
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
It's a big step.

76
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
It's a big step.

77
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,500
People like to talk about the experience of being in a space, but it's a big step.

78
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
It's a big step.

79
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
It's a big step.

80
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,500
So, given this project that we have, what's the bottom line for the students who are in the space?

81
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,500
The question is, how do we do this?

82
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:32,500
We want them to wear the mask and work with the subject matter, so that they can feel the vibe and feel the vibe of the space together.

83
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,500
And those expressions that are created in different communities are going to be important to everything.

84
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,500
We can continue to take the mask off, and the other things that are going to be important to the students.

85
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,500
So, that's the bottom line.

86
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,500
So, what is project development?

87
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500
So, we took a project.

88
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
And I was going to say, a project for it.

89
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,500
It was a project for a specific subject.

90
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,500
It was a project for a community project, how do we do that?

91
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
There's a project that we're going to find.

92
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:09,500
And the other thing is, well, we expect that the dates are on top of the February dates, so that the project is finalized, so that it's finished.

93
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
We'll never forget the fact that we organized in).

94
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,500
We organized in serves a very good intended purpose.

95
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:26,500
And we energized the disturbance that was against us, or we experienced the disturbance at least in March of 2019.

96
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Then, we tried to some degree to spice up, and if not, I should have saved them in drag if it wasn't for Tangier Vargas, his balanced display of the space, then it was going to be two spaces.

97
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,500
But screw that, that was going to be the third space assignment.

98
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:44,340
You can expect the kids to talk to you naturally like other kids do, but we just want you to

99
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,280
be physically active, and we expect that, if this local education scheme improves, and

100
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,540
if it works in your partner's place, and if the plan was to take ebency for granted, it

101
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,540
will tend to.

102
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,000
So, let's talk about 對 الل歩 furry.

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,940
I've ró to get loves to communicate and gifts.

104
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,540
It's there that colorfans, and is a great learn mat in the green.

105
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,900
These companies have done great things.

106
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,520
Thank you for all your presentations, everyone, and congratulations on this amazing 30th anniversary

107
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,520
And the other thing is that the question is,

108
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,520
can you explain to us what you mean by asking the question?

109
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Raise your hand if you know the answer to the question.

110
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,520
I will arbitrarily say, you are a good person,

111
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,520
because you're a good person.

112
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,520
I will explain to us how we can get out of this

113
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,520
time frame and how we can get out of this situation.

114
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,520
So, for next question, I'm going to ask you

115
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,520
what is your goal question?

116
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
I want to jump into the question first,

117
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
because I'm going to ask you a question

118
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,520
that is really important to me.

119
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,520
And then, I'm going to give you an example

120
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
of what's going on in the community.

121
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
What's the best way to work between the two?

122
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
What are you going to do with the right people

123
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
in the community?

124
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,520
So, how do we get by with this?

125
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,520
It's the thing that I want to say that's a good one.

126
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,520
I'm going to give you an example of that.

127
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,520
So, let's start with the question.

128
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,520
This is a question that I want to ask you,

129
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,520
because this is the practice of the question.

130
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,520
So, these are the things that I would like to show you

131
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
at the top.

132
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,520
I'd like to show you a little bit of the example

133
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,520
that I've put in the right place.

134
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,520
I've got references to the question

135
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,520
that I've put in the right place in the second.

136
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,520
But in the copy of the question,

137
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
I've put in the right place in the second.

138
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
And I've got references to the question.

139
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
And the real practice is the way that someone

140
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
has to come to exactly what they're saying

141
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,520
to indicate what's going on in the community.

142
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,520
And this is the way that I've put in the right place.

143
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,520
So, we get a little bit of an example

144
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,520
of what's going on in the community.

145
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,520
So, now I'm going to give you an example.

146
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,520
So, let's see what you've got.

147
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,520
This is a question that I want to ask you.

148
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,520
This is a question that I want to give you

149
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,520
and you won't find that in any of the statements

150
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,520
that we've made.

151
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,520
Let's take a look at the kind of experience

152
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,520
that we've had to make those statements.

153
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,520
So, let's take a look.

154
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,520
So, we brought some text to the table

155
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,520
to show you some of the things that we've done

156
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,520
in the last few weeks.

157
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,520
The first thing that comes to mind

158
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,520
is part of the web class that we're making

159
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,520
for people with disabilities.

160
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,520
This is part of that.

161
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,520
All of the web and the clients that's

162
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,520
going to be using this for the next few weeks

163
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,520
are the clients that are using it the most.

164
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,520
And part of the part that I want to ask you

165
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,520
is if you're going to include this math

166
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,520
and function and the function

167
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
of this is what gets logged

168
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,520
when toward error,

169
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,520
and your part of it is what gets it

170
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,520
logged in terms of the time

171
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,520
that you've been using it.

172
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,520
So, what your problem will be

173
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,520
if you get a salary of $20,000

174
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,520
away from the time that you've been using it.

175
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,520
So, we're going to

176
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,520
we're going to grab

177
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,520
these text contentions

178
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,520
and we're going to put them in front of you.

179
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,520
We're going to do this one fast

180
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,520
with the way we start the work.

181
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,520
We're going to talk about that in the open.

182
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,520
There's a lot of nice writing that we start from

183
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,520
and it's really fun to try to do this with.

184
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
We're going to take that as well.

185
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,520
It's really been a busy and fun process.

186
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,520
So, we're going to do this

187
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,520
next.

188
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,520
So,

189
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,520
the concept of

190
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,520
that's going to be

191
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,520
a very simple one.

192
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,520
I'm going to talk about some of the things that you can do

193
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,520
in the text contentions.

194
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,520
So, we're going to start with

195
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,520
the text contentions and then we'll talk about the functions.

196
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,520
So, we're going to

197
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,520
do a lot of text contentions.

198
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,520
So, one is going to be a very simple one.

199
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,520
So, we're going to do

200
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,520
a little bit of a simple one.

201
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,520
So, we're going to do

202
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,520
a little bit of sobre everything

203
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,520
that's going to be in the text contentions and the text drive程ions.

204
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,120
So, to start with, I'm

205
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,120
going to do this, take a note of everything

206
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,120
and put it in the box and know that

207
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,120
it's very good. So, something like that.

208
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,520
The classic

209
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,520
glitch that you use to disguise a text contentor

210
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,580
and the text you might have done

211
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,580
in future talks or things like that.

212
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,660
But then, you're going to stick it

213
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,660
in the constitution.

214
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,660
That is the basic stuff.

215
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,660
And here is the end of that.

216
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,660
OK, so here's more What about

217
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,660
We want to make sure that we have the right to have a good time.

218
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,660
Thank you.

219
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,660
We are going to talk about some of the things that we have to think about.

220
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,660
First of all, we need to address problems that you may have from your colleagues in any

221
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,660
place you go to.

222
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,660
So I'm going to talk about some of the things that we need to think about.

223
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,660
Finally, let's look at some of the things that we need to think about.

224
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,660
First of all, we want to think about the challenges facing the end-to-end.

225
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,660
I think that's a very good point, especially from a state's point of view.

226
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,660
We're looking at an example that shows all the things that we need to think about.

227
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,660
It's another focus of the discussion.

228
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,660
I'm calling this focus on the end-to-end.

229
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,660
It's a continuous.

230
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,660
I got the moments.

231
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,660
I got the right to use the right focus to the end-to-end.

232
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,660
It's a very important focus.

233
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,660
It is like, right from the beginning, yeah, that's going to be the thing.

234
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,660
It's a mechanical homework from my point of view.

235
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,660
It's not a feedback.

236
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,660
It's a process.

237
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,660
It's a process.

238
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,660
And it's a very important focus.

239
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,660
That's how I read it.

240
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,660
I'm almost done.

241
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,660
Okay.

242
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,660
So that's a time-consuming thing.

243
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,660
Okay.

244
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,660
So, partly what I like to do is we do all the kind of things that we can.

245
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,660
So, down with the tight technical issues that we've just talked about.

246
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,660
Okay.

247
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,660
So, if we do the same thing without much to be done about,

248
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,660
which is, okay, we've got the code,

249
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,660
then separate types of contracts, all of them,

250
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,660
and then we can come up with some of the problems.

251
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,660
And then we have problems with all the code that we put together in the middle of the course.

252
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,660
So, this is something that we found in the previous session,

253
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,660
which is we can remove that structure.

254
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,660
Other problems that we've created are the effects that come from the

255
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,660
different types of contract situations.

256
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,660
We have some effects that we want to find some effective play.

257
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,660
This is one of the most important things that we've found in that.

258
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,660
Okay.

259
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,660
And then we get back to the things that we've already found in the different types of contracts,

260
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,660
which are the same type.

261
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,660
I'll overdo it, Mr. Kutuzov,

262
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,660
but it's just a phrase that I'll go through in terms of the effects of contracts.

263
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,660
Okay.

264
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,660
Thank you.

265
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,660
Thank you.

266
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,660
Okay.

267
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:15,660
So, now we're on the topic of the problems of the aggregate cost of contracts.

268
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:21,660
Is the aggregate content at the moment at which this approach is evaluated?

269
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,660
We have some of the problems in the aggregate.

270
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,660
Okay.

271
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,660
So, I'll just go through this just a moment.

272
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,660
The aggregate cost of contracts is the amount of contracts that are typically evaluated.

273
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,660
So, the concept of ground, which is what we're looking at, the value of it.

274
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,660
But we're not seeing it yet.

275
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,660
Remember I said that's part of the problem.

276
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,660
It is the rate that we're looking at.

277
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,660
So, that means that we're looking at the cost of contracts,

278
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,660
but we need to get more protection in the aggregate cost of contracts.

279
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,660
And we want to do it because that's what we're going to do.

280
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,660
So, we need to get the contract.

281
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,660
It's a contract that is going to be a financial, full-backed contract.

282
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,660
It's going to be a one-way contract, one-way contract.

283
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,660
And that's what we're going to do.

284
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,660
We're going to go through a lot of problems with contracts.

285
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,660
We're going to go through a lot of problems with contracts.

286
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,660
We're going to go through a lot of problems with contracts.

287
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:16,660
And then, I was writing another electoral contract in fact.

288
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,660
So, when you've done some good contracts,

289
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,660
there are loads of market contracts.

290
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,660
This is one of the most important things.

291
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,660
And it's actually one of the things that is very much in the service of

292
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,660
the interest of taking support from people to go out and control our space.

293
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,660
It's important for what we're calling the community to market contract.

294
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,660
We expect to be taking advantage of the money to make it.

295
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,660
And that means that's going to be very much in the system to market contract.

296
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,660
And that's very important that we want to do something.

297
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,660
When I say first of all, I mean support for the company,

298
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,660
to the companies, to the companies.

299
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,660
That's his way of doing it.

300
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,660
That's how he does it.

301
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,660
So, first, we get the benefits by providing the data.

302
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,660
It's a very important thing.

303
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,660
That's the way it is.

304
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,660
It's a very important thing.

305
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,660
It's a very important thing.

306
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,660
It's a very important thing.

307
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,660
But we're not doing it yet.

308
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,660
Because to keep this going on,

309
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,660
five of the most important things that we're going to do

310
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,660
is basically to have a better understanding of the industry

311
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,660
and as far as the things that are important to the market

312
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,660
and the things that are important to the company.

313
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,660
And when it's a serious problem, it's not a problem.

314
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,660
It's far as the company can go.

315
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,660
It's best if it's not a problem.

316
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,660
And the only thing that can be faced by the company is

317
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,660
to have a good insight into the whole thing.

318
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,660
And that's something that's very important.

319
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,660
That's the fault of which the company is,

320
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,660
that the company is going to create the benefit that it deserves.

321
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,660
And that's why we're going to get the benefits.

322
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,660
So, the job is to communicate to the person

323
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,660
that feels like talking to you.

324
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,660
That way we can sort of make sense.

325
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,660
And that's what's going to be in your order.

326
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,660
It's going to get to you.

327
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,660
But it's not going to be the sort of stuff that we're going to be

328
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,660
able to get from a customer.

329
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,660
This isn't the real customer.

330
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,660
It's going to get to you.

331
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660
It's the best thing.

332
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,660
This is the sort of thing that we're going to be able to do.

333
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,660
That's the best thing.

334
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,660
Thank you.

335
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,660
When do you think you're going to start a business?

336
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,660
I'm not going to start a business.

337
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,660
But I often think that I'm going to have to pass through a lot

338
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,660
of different things that I'm going to be doing

339
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,660
to make money in the future.

340
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,660
And I think that's going to be a great thing to do.

341
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,660
And I've also been able to do that in all this time

342
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,660
that we've been in the business for a long time.

343
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,660
And I've been able to do that.

344
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,660
There are some places where customers can be attractive.

345
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,660
Do you need to have a third customer?

346
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,660
This is a great customer.

347
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,660
You can have a few different types of people.

348
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,660
The first one is the one that's more experienced in this thing.

349
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,660
And the other one is about the one that's more experienced in this thing.

350
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,660
And that's what makes it so that the one that you have on this

351
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,660
one is highly attractive to you.

352
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,660
And that's what makes it so that the one that you have on this

353
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,660
one is highly attractive to you.

354
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,660
And that's what makes it so that the one that you have on this

355
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,660
one is highly attractive to you.

356
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,660
So coming up is the original new statement that is finally

357
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,660
developed in the United States in 2014.

358
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,660
Well, it's a new statement that is quite a thing.

359
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,660
It's been a success for a long time.

360
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,660
It's been a success for a long time.

361
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,660
So how does it affect the business?

362
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,660
The previous statement that I made was a statement that

363
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,660
just took four months, and it's been a success for a long time.

364
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,660
It's been a success for a long time.

365
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
It's been a success for a long time.

366
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,660
So the fact that the new guidelines that have been put in place

367
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,660
take quite a short time.

368
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,660
So you want to find more to incorporate labs and new things

369
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,660
in this product.

370
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,660
They have all these commentators, there's the force of force.

371
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,660
That is clearly the hard, very difficult part.

372
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,660
I can say that the first thing that I think that we need to do

373
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,660
is develop this new statement.

374
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,660
I think that the point that we need to make is to use the

375
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,660
actual information that's placed within the statement

376
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,660
because it's new and I think that's a good thing.

377
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,660
We need to find the right information that we can talk about

378
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,660
in the beginning.

379
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,660
This is the fact that last year, the next year, which was the

380
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,660
year before the new rules were introduced, so a lot of this

381
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660
process was done in 2014.

382
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,660
And this is what we're going to look for.

383
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,660
So I think that's a good thing.

384
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,660
I think we're甚麼 of the pe señora and I think people

385
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,660
need to look at the fact that surprised us

386
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,660
is that in場 convenient we have a significant lack of

387
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,660
capacity to operate in this space.

388
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,660
This is not been in a context.

389
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,660
So here we are, going in different ways and I think the

390
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,660
huge contribution is another wise move.

391
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,660
Because it's not just this.

392
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,660
These big companies that do what needs to be done and the

393
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,660
But obviously I want you to write that for me.

394
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,660
So you can put a pen in front of the question.

395
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,660
And I'll draw it and you can put it in front of it.

396
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,660
Now it seems like the science of science is a little bit too close to the point.

397
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,660
So you can draw it and you can just put it in front of it.

398
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,660
So draw it and I'll draw it and you can put it in front of it.

399
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,660
That's right.

400
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,660
So I just show us what's in your eyes.

401
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,660
I think that's the point we told you about.

402
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,660
Okay, so where were we?

403
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
I think we're done.

404
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,660
Well, that is one.

405
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,660
Yeah, something's right there.

406
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,660
Big couple of problems between you two.

407
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,660
Okay, so that's the question.

408
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,660
So that's what they've been trying to protect.

409
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:51,660
And I'm going to show you what's going on in the middle of this.

410
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,660
Okay, so we've got the pumpkin tentacle.

411
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,660
And you can really use the pumpkin tentacle as an operative.

412
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,660
So you can put a pumpkin in the box.

413
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,660
So this is kind of a complex one.

414
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,660
So again, it is largely a pumpkin tentacle.

415
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,660
So we were to grab some of the things that we thought we were going to do.

416
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,660
So this is a huge question.

417
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,660
It's been served in the physics fiction industry

418
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,660
for some time, for the chemistry, for the computer.

419
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,660
So I'm going to run a few of the other things.

420
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,660
Why don't we just see what we've got here.

421
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,660
What we've got here is the physics problem.

422
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,660
And we're going to do a little bit of physics.

423
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,660
And we're going to do a little bit of physics.

424
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,660
And if you have a specific computer performance problem,

425
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,660
you can just look at the physics fiction and the physics fiction.

426
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,660
Let's look at the physics.

427
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,660
And it's fine.

428
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,660
This is in the original print.

429
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,660
I can compile it.

430
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,660
You can do physics fiction with it in the original print.

431
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,660
So that it's two different physics in a very different way.

432
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,660
You have to get to the other two things.

433
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,660
But what about getting to all the functions that are in the physics fiction?

434
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,660
What about everybody's favorite subject?

435
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,660
What about the game?

436
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,660
What did you get wrong?

437
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,660
I'm going to give you the price.

438
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,660
I'm going to give you the price of the game.

439
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,660
You have to go to the first question,

440
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,660
why do you want to do it in the physics fiction?

441
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,660
Why?

442
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,660
You think this is like a human being.

443
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,660
Let's just talk about the physics.

444
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,660
Let's talk about the human being.

445
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,660
You can go to the physics, and you can do physics.

446
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,660
I'm not going to mess with your brain.

447
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,660
You're brain is a useless thing.

448
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,660
You have a bunch of things on your back.

449
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,660
You're not going to mess with the other things.

450
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,660
You're going to mess with the computer.

451
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,660
You're going to mess with the computer.

452
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,660
You're going to mess with the computer.

453
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,660
So, there are steps that we've been talking about in the last few days.

454
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,660
A lot of quick ones.

455
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,660
We've been talking about using print right there in the middle of our engines.

456
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,660
So, I think it says go up there's some kind of tool like this.

457
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,660
And then, but it really is very inspiring for the people of Georgia.

458
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,660
That's the important thing to do.

459
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,660
It's not about the interest of the people of Georgia.

460
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,660
It's about the interest of the people of Georgia.

461
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:08,660
So, I suppose that I will say for a moment that the Trump people of Georgia

462
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,660
are the same old people that I've been talking about for a while.

463
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,660
I suppose that the package is very important to the people of Georgia.

464
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,660
Obviously, the fact that it's a very important thing to the people of Georgia,

465
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,660
is very important to the people of Georgia.

466
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,660
And that's the reason why I'm saying that.

467
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,660
Okay, so, because some messages that I've received from the President

468
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,660
are very similar to the ones that I've received from the President,

469
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,660
and I've received from the President from the United States,

470
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,660
and I've received from the United States from the United States,

471
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,660
the fact that everything that the President has said is very similar to what the President has said.

472
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,660
So, I suppose that the President has said a lot of things that he's not supposed to say.

473
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,660
And we have to show all the information that's in this package.

474
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,660
So, we need to know that it's not supposed to be the same.

475
00:20:52,660 --> 00:21:17,080
So, I'm not going to give you a

476
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,660
lot of information.

477
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,660
I'm just going to give you a little bit of a brief introduction to the package.

478
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,660
So, I'm going to give you a little bit of a brief introduction to the package.

479
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,660
So, I'm going to give you a little bit of a brief introduction to the package.

480
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,660
So, I'm going to give you a little bit of a brief introduction to the package.

481
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,660
So, I'm going to give you a little bit of a brief introduction to the package.

482
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,660
So, I'm going to give you a little bit of a brief introduction to the package.

483
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,660
So, I'm going to give you a little bit of a brief introduction to the package.

484
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,660
So, I'm going to give you a little bit of a brief introduction to the package.

485
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,660
So, I'm going to give you a little bit of a brief introduction to the package.

486
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,660
So, I'm going to give you a little bit of a brief introduction to the package.

487
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,660
So, most users probably have a lot more than you need to use the package to make.

488
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,660
So, most users probably have a lot more than you need to use the package to make.

489
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,660

509
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,660
You guys can put your questions together.

510
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,660
Cute question.

511
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,660
Do both frameworks belong in the OMN as well?

512
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,660
So for the column, do you think that dimensions touch?

513
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,660
Or are covered web-based Hera sheet storage?

514
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,660
So, in tech these requires a limit of use.

515
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,660
In technology, do you think these changes occur against one set?

516
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,420
Not in், not in, not in, the size of the condition in which Pi and Pi message.

517
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,540
But they don't rather Marsiberts in mind

518
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,840
than college students like that.

519
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,860
And I'm so happy that we had all of these

520
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,520
nicegebullies to talk about during this

521
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,240
was a fantastic time to,

522
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,460
and especially貴する class right

523
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,120
where no one liked刻 z是這樣

524
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,720
and the North Tarzan concerned.

525
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,300
I'm just bumpy out toward the White Widow,

526
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,980
the education stuck in school and the

527
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,300
applied culture, but I'm really excited

528
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,520
feeling involved with these lengthw guides

529
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,520
You are at the SCA and you're asked to ask questions.

530
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,720
What is the best way to do that?

531
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,760
You have to be careful of your speech.

532
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,520
So, first of all,

533
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,160
what is the best way to do that?

534
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

535
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,480
I'm sorry.

536
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,280
You have to be careful of your speech.

537
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,200
It's a good question.

538
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,440
Here's the questions.

539
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

540
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,360
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

541
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,280
The definition of language in this case is not very nice.

542
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,280
So, GLL is the definition of language.

543
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,320
GLL is people who talk to other people

544
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,000
and they can use it to communicate.

545
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,560
It's the same as the word.

546
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,520
It's the best at everything, so it's not bad.

547
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,080
And so, documents is a good way to document language.

548
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,320
It's a good way to document language.

549
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,680
It's a good way to document language.

550
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,480
And then, why not influence the people?

551
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,400
That's the funnest thing.

552
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,520
It's the funnest thing.

553
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,040
So, I like to influence the people.

554
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,840
It's a good way to influence the people.

555
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,920
I can do it.

556
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,720
So, what are the things that you can influence?

557
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,280
I would love to comment WHAT YOU י Can promote your own

558
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,560
and that's the subject of my webinar today.

559
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,560
What other things I hope to expand on

560
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,440
and why I chose GLL because

561
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,400
for me, it's the entire language lesclised.

562
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,920
You may have started listening

563
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,760
and Document language has now become an exam

564
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,040
away from one another,

565
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,840
but often times the languages myself

566
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,080
serve the same purpose,

567
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,680
a very nice, very unique world we're much are Dinge

568
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,520
You know, a very magical world is ahead.

569
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,280
So, how would you regions of that world play out?

570
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
But people...

571
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:25,720
I just thought, in the very beginning, I worked in two companies, in Texas, and I worked in Texas, where I like to learn,

572
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,720
I like to learn the way I capture these things, and I feel it's a huge part of me.

573
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:38,720
And I went to the U.S. to get into the company, and then I came back to the U.S. to work there.

574
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,720
And then at the bottom, I went and took a very good proxies, and I went to the U.S. to find some direct,

575
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,720
effective, effective functions in all of them, in such a way that I could actually get into the business.

576
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,720
And then I dropped the project into the dark, and then I put in the project into the dark,

577
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,720
and it was a very successful project, and it was a very successful project.

578
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,720
And we're taking two different kinds of ventriloquism, that's what we're talking about.

579
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,720
And we're talking about the direct function, and at all, you take the direct function, that brings you to the end of the project.

580
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,720
And it's a very good thing. So we can do that in a very simple way.

581
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,720
But I want to just mention, in this place, that these are the first two projects.

582
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,720
So it's not a very good one, and I'm just not going to say it's a very good one, but it's a very good one.

583
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,720
Yet, the actual concept, you know, the ability to...

584
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,720
You won't practice any of the other projects, but it's a very, very, very good thing.

585
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,720
The ability to see the different kinds of ventriloquism, what the effect it gives,

586
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:44,720
and it's very positive, particularly since they've been doing a lot of ventriloquism in the first two months.

587
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,720
It's a really, really good thing, because everything that we do is not going to be the same as we want it to be,

588
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720
because that's what we expect it to be.

589
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:59,720
And the job is to be a job that actually creates new ventriloquism, as well as what we expect it to be.

590
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
That's the second thing.

591
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,720
Just as they've done the last project, the one that's been a lot of work,

592
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,720
and it's been a tremendous process of time,

593
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,720
we've done a lot of ventriloquism in the last four years, and we've done a great deal of ventriloquism in the last eight years.

594
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
So it's a great experience for us all.

595
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,720
We've done a lot of ventriloquism, and we've done a great deal of ventriloquism in the last four years.

596
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,720
So I want to say, for those of you who are watching this right now, I think you're going to see the same thing.

597
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,720
I know where the bottom line is, and you've got three of your things.

598
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,720
We've got an intelligent computer that can do this really simple thing,

599
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,720
where you can find some data that we've got to work with the president,

600
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:45,720
and the original art is made to look like this, but it's a little bit more different from what we've done.

601
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,720
Which is, first of all, the building is going to be white, and it's going to look like this,

602
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,720
and it's going to look like that, and it's going to look like that.

603
00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:17,640
So I'm going to start looking to look at what works best for any general Ef

604
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
It's all good.

605
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,720
I think we're going to the end.

606
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
We're going to the end?

607
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,920
Yes.

608
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,720
Let's just hurry and get to the end.

609
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,320
I think we're going to the end.

610
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,920
I think it's a bit different from the beginning.

611
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,320
Actually, no, it's not the beginning.

612
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,120
It's obviously people, but I realize that I'm here for the rest of the session.

613
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,720
All right. So, all right.

614
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,720
This next piece is a lot of work.

615
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,720
We got last week's they asked to see what theions Outlander.

616
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,720
It's probably this episode that started in 2019.

617
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,720
He just was with a Blackson Foundation.

618
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,720
If he's ever got to join our must, he's not going to a certain point in the week.

619
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,020
And the other thing, when we look at his age, is when you take his eyes off the Tactics of Tackle

620
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,260
out behaved the right way.

621
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,100
hard to believe that Ant 他一直在担心了

622
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,120
I don't think that spreading of the virus in the classroom is important.

623
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,540
I don't think it's refuses to to upbeat training.

624
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,140
I don't think it's getting into a golf match meant to drink.

625
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,820
The good old history of the sought-and-see of сделbregon

626
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,720
don't really look the same Yeah.

627
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,340
what's relevant movements that are

628
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,140
siellä

629
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:42,920
The origin traffic justice system seems

630
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,220
before

631
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
hose

632
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,400
the

633
00:29:46,400 --> 00:30:06,920
It was simply what this whole assembly of people to the side of the balcony.

634
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:12,220
Dear sir.

635
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,220
applications, but because the rules can be represented in

636
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,220
the future's context, there are the problems which are

637
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,220
not only in the system, but in the future's context.

638
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,220
They need to be in the context of the business.

639
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,220
That's what the best way to work out.

640
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,220
The only way to do that is to use the same framework

641
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,220
that comes with the application.

642
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,220
So the only way to do that is to use the same framework

643
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,220
that comes with the application.

644
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:38,220
The problem is that it's expected to be in the

645
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,220
context of the business.

646
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,220
And that's the point.

647
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,220
The point is that the problem is in the context of the business.

648
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,220
And it did give me the sense to work the outside of the

649
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,220
purpose of the business, which I thought was really

650
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,220
tempting.

651
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
It was tempting.

652
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,220
So what real work has used to execute the

653
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,220
institution is the use of the D2 toolkit, which is

654
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,220
typically used by the business and the people who are

655
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,220
part of the spectrum currently.

656
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,220
Do you use the E2 toolkit?

657
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,220
Yes.

658
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,220
And we use the E2 toolkit because we

659
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,220
have 5 sets of gatecribers.

660
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,220
So we have 3 sets of gatecribers and this means that

661
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:23,640
if you use the E2 one, you get an inexcess Campbell

662
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,220
culture that is irrelevant as a business.

663
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,220
and that's what we're going to do.

664
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:38,220
But, everything that's going to put the community in a good place,

665
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,220
one thing that I've talked about several times,

666
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,220
one thing that I want to be very clear about,

667
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,220
which is the general question, and I'm going to talk about it,

668
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,220
this is the same thing you're always thinking of,

669
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,220
one is the most dangerous thing in the state of California.

670
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:55,220
This is when the trial of your justice system is complicated,

671
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,220
and you're going to have to get what you can.

672
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,220
The part that's so dangerous for us,

673
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,220
I really want to focus on community,

674
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,220
and I want to focus on the people that are in this country.

675
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,220
I want to focus on the people that are in this country.

676
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:08,220
I want to focus on the people that are in this country.

677
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,220
And this is the second question.

678
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,220
Why are the communities in the country?

679
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,220
Because the justice system,

680
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,220
and the physical labor workers,

681
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,220
are the most dangerous in the country.

682
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,220
So, it's something that we're going to have to fight for.

683
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,220
And I think that's a great question,

684
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,220
and I think it's something that we're going to have to fight for,

685
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,220
but this comes to great effect

686
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,220
in some pretty different places

687
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,220
because we're getting a lot of money

688
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,220
for some of these conversations,

689
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,220
and I think we're going to have to fight for that.

690
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,220
And I think we're going to have to fight for this.

691
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,220
So, we're going to have to fight,

692
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,220
and then it's going to be a big day for them.

693
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,220
This is a really intellectually interesting question.

00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,260
Take all the advice

704
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,700
if you able to

705
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,380
extremely simply

706
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,980
at the diploma

707
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,420
Gotta get it

708
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,420
and the

709
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,420
way that we can do this is

710
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,420
to try to pull out the

711
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,420
important things that

712
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,420
are coming in the second year and the

713
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,420
later years and make them

714
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,420
even more fantastic using

715
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,420
what we've done in the last few years.

716
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,420
So this is essentially the first

717
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,420
function of the new technology

718
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,420
that we've built so far.

719
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,420
And the first time we've built it

720
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,420
in the first place.

721
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,420
And I think that's the first

722
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,420
thing that we've done. So what was

723
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,420
the first thing that we've done?

724
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,420
Well, we've built it by continuing

725
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,420
thinking about the future together.

726
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,420
It's a fantastic thing. It's a fantastic

727
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,420
thing. I think it's really important

728
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,420
that we do this. It's a really good

729
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,420
thing. It's a really good thing.

730
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,420
It's a really good thing. It's a really good

731
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,420
thing. It's a very important thing.

732
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,420
It's a very important thing as well.

733
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,420
And I just wanted to mention that

734
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,420
we've been doing a lot of things in the

735
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,420
past that I literally can't even

736
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,420
describe with words.

737
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,420
For instance, on this campus, we've

738
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,420
done equations of Wold-planning.

739
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,400
If guys would landscape g ένα

740
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,180
pensamento, in the first

741
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:43,980
section, we'd DOize

742
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,980
So it's a bit of a

743
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,980
question, you guys, what type of

744
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,980
knowledge or stuff do you have in this group?

745
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,980
In this group, do you think that some of the

746
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,980
discussions are being answered?

747
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,980
So,

748
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,980
because of the fact that, as you just said, Kevin,

749
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,980
talk a bit too much, but what we're trying to do

750
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,980
is to probably look at the outcome

751
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,980
of the discussion, and I think that's the

752
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,980
framework of the conversation, and it's about

753
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,980
how we're going to address this.

754
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,980
So, the general question

755
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,980
that we have is, is that some of the

756
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,980
issues that we're trying to address are

757
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,980
the issues that we're trying to address, and that's

758
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,980
the first point. But I'll speak about the issues

759
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,980
with the moderator, the

760
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,980
moderator's questions, Kevin, and the

761
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,980
questions about the case of the college

762
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,980
of health, and the fact that the

763
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,980
questions are being answered.

764
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,980
So, these are the issues that we're trying to address,

765
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,980
and the questions that we're trying to address.

766
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,980
So, not just one, but several questions

767
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,980
in that case, is the kind of

768
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,980
the group

769
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,980
that we're trying to address,

770
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,980
and the things that we've touched on

771
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,980
with the presentation of the

772
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,980
presentation of the presentation of the

773
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,980
conversation, and then the

774
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,980
questions. And then some way to

775
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,980
make it as simple as we can, and then

776
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,980
the next thing that we're trying to do is

777
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,980
to actually try to address these issues.

778
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,980
And if we were to

779
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,980
start to take a look at a

780
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,980
bit of the discussion between the questions,

781
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,980
a lot of the things that we're trying to

782
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,980
address are the source of the space, the

783
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,980
context, and the questions that we're trying to

784
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,660
Today's basic ideas look at sprinkling—

785
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,540
to get the last bit of what we think

786
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,520
won't prove this graphic termsharp

787
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,540
is now so innovative it could involve

788
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,360
in a finite sum of four different forms.

789
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:24,240
But some of them, of course,

790
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,360
although the way we underground

791
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,840
look at these properties

792
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,840
is ultimately based on those things.

793
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,280
First of all, if it belongs to those communities,

794
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,820
what it means for those communities

795
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,260
is that it doesn't know by now

796
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,620
how to make it a applications

797
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,640
that associations give it to its portion.

798
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,800
from all, basically, that system is then one ?!

799
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,980
Except when you go from actually passe point 1 to next point two,

800
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,760
you see one ledger on top, you still smoosh it.

801
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,040
But what we put out there today,

802
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,720
that I didn't want you to go straight from that gun,

803
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,540
and I was leaving this room because I didn't want you to . . .

804
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,660
that you were passing . . .

805
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,580
crossing . . .

806
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,440
Some of the pockets %$ recreate,

807
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,660
you're able for instance to invent some flexibility,

808
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,620
using certain chemicals,

809
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,620
and then we can see that it's a good one for us.

810
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,620
It's a good one for us.

811
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,620
It's a good one for us.

812
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,620
It's a good one for us.

813
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,620
It's a good one for us.

814
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,620
So, those are the thoughts that I think are important

815
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,620
about the first and most important thing.

816
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:22,620
Indeed, the first thing is the first thing.

817
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,620
Let's look for our future.

818
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,620
And obviously, we have a big deal

819
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,620
from the LMEI and the National Health Fund.

820
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,620
This could be a big deal.

821
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,620
It could be a big deal.

822
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,620
I want to talk about the LMEI and the NCEE

823
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,620
and the NCEE.

824
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,620
I was rather technical,

825
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,620
but I'm not going to talk about it.

826
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,620
We're going to talk a bit about this in a few minutes.

827
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,620
Why not?

828
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,620
Why not?

829
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,620
So, that's one thing.

830
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,620
And then we have the second thing.

831
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,620
So, that's also probably one of the things

832
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,620
that I'm going to talk about.

833
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,620
The other thing is the new concentration.

834
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,620
It's a great thing for the country.

835
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,620
It's a great thing for the country.

836
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,620
It's a very, very good thing for the country.

837
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,620
It's a very, very good thing for the country.

838
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,620
So, let's think about the new concentration.

839
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,620
It's a fabulous new concentration.

840
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,620
I can't wait to talk about it.

841
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,620
It's a fantastic, amazing, amazing thing.

842
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,620
It's been a really interesting thing

843
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,620
for the country to think about.

844
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,620
And it's a really good thing for the country.

845
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,620
So, the NNF country is also the world's

846
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,620
largest concentration base for the development

847
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,620
of the drug of our politics.

848
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,620
And that's that.

849
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,620
So, the concentration of the NNF country

850
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,620
is a type of what's in one bit.

851
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,620
So, yeah, very important for our regime.

852
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,620
So, today I'm going to talk about

853
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,620
very subtle things like the collective new

854
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,620
concentration and information concentration.

855
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,620
But as well as the other questions,

856
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,620
we are going to talk about the questions

857
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,620
that we're going to discuss in one second.

858
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,620
And the questions that we're going to talk about.

859
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,620
So, very subtle questions.

860
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,620
And right from the interest of studies

861
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,620
and in terms of the national level,

862
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,620
we don't really have much to do with the knowledge.

863
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,620
We just expect that to be more useful.

864
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,620
We also have a little bit of space

865
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,620
where we can do this in the field.

866
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,620
So, it's very useful.

867
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,620
It's very helpful for the country.

868
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,620
So, that's that.

869
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,620
So, that's it.

870
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,620
Hello.

871
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,620
Any questions?

872
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,620
You know, we need to get a little bit of time

873
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,620
to get through this.

874
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,620
We would, pretty much, just leave the mic

875
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,620
up there if you remember.

876
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,620
That would be very nice.

877
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,620
We're going to have a question.

878
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,620
Yeah.

879
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,620
Hello.
