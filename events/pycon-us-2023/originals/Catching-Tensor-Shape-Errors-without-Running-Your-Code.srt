00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,120
To put it in another way in an opportunity to control it bit I think also

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,020
I'm taking a little risk of not having access to a computer,

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,420
if I'm going to lose my computer, I lost web allegiance anywhere I time or

00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
How do you can keep them safe and

97
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,920
我想提提看

98
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,880

be constable

102
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,880
be constable

103
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,880
how do you keep them safe

104
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
be constable

105
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,980
What

106
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,980
you tell the bomb

107
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,980
you text the bullet

108
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,980
you tell the bomb

109
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:25,120
Which is to become, like a

three

112
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,520
So, we have all been discussing it recently,

113
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,520
the signs of remarkable problems due to which

114
00:08:46,520 --> 00:09:05,560
evenpenthe

115
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,560
No one additional to say thank you for your support and encouragement.

116
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,980
Last year, the United States Title turning compete in the U.S.

117
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:24,520

countries, but their

122
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,760
space.

123
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,980
this pandemic.

124
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:13,580
I want you to pay tribute to every young Jewish football fund owner, and I know he deserves

125
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,580
one.

126
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:23,000
As an adult football fan and journalist, it's not easy to write about a committed debt and

127
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,480
so that they can stand standing side by side and dunno where to stand,

128
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,880

00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,040
what Drum hp, can't stand the wall universities,

130
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:13,060

Franco & Roosqv,

132
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:28,400
how to build 먹어리술.

133
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,400
and the concept of the data is just a representation of the data that's been collected.

134
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,400
I think that the most basic thing that we can do is to have a pretty big, big, big, big

183
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:23,200
However

184
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,940
In the same sense, whether the students are part of the different

185
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,060
different backgrounds or the feeling that they have,

186
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,520
when someone comes in to eat pizza,

187
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,200
and there's a discussion where it's

188
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,920
our job to do this.

189
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,360
For users in specialists and credit strategy in the field,

190
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,920
we're going to have to, they're outside of in search inner

191
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,360
with their things that come in the field.

192
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,260
The newspaper, let's just run it through,

193
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,260
I think that's a great idea.

194
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,260
This is a great discussion.

195
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,260
And I think this is a great discussion

196
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,260
for the future of the internet.

197
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,260
It's a great discussion and a great time.

198
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,260
So, we're going to start with this topic.

199
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,260
Now, I'm going to start with the topic

200
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,260
of the internet.

201
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,260
It's a very important topic

202
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,260
because it's important to us

203
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,260
and it's important to the internet

204
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,260
and it's important to the internet.

205
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,260
And I think it's a great discussion.

206
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,260
That's excellent discussion.

207
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,260
And I think this is a very important topic.

208
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,260
As part of this talk,

209
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,260
we're going to look at the

210
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:45,260
legal term

211
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,260
which is servi shopping.

212
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,460
and we actually talked a little bit about it.

213
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,720
And it makes completeness possible.

214
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,740
So, so, not just to put that through and it's not then

215
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,320
but also it's not planned at the beginning.

216
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,200
As from year 20 they elsewhere at the end.

217
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,600
So fiercely measured in the journal for writers

218
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,740
and early masters and grade illustrators

219
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,920
and Sheaves isn't the only one of us that have narrowly escaped from this.

220
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,720
In this company we obviously are all very, very, very, very people,

221
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,680
and our balance is really limited.

222
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,560
So A, thank you.

223
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:35,460

How are you ?

227
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:51,220
Many other possibilities were found Tsukitano working in phase 1,

228
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,700
waiting to Battle Grail against Tsukapi,

229
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,120
but one such strategy was not covered by this New tylko.

230
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,840
And that assistant there called Taru tuna –

231
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,840
that used a machine made from renewables.

232
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,440
KSAS, the US Office of Media and Media Communication

233
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,880

and it was absolutely incredible to!!

235
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,240
I mean, both of you couldn't 14, they knew the

236
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,900
abstractions of maybe,

237
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,220
they would Naughton School of the Faculty

but you came from, it was the last one

240
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,240
you went into that,

241
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,040

And later, there are diplomatic talks between countries.

251
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,160
As it was shown, if a Defense Deputy

the immediate necessary Bid to it

257
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,120
an inquiry should be done

Así que el

259
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And I think that the most important thing is that we have to be able to protect ourselves

260
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and protect our society.

261
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000

And I think that the most important thing is that we have to protect ourselves and protect

269
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,960

And I wanted to learn more about trade functions in the area that struck me the most.

279
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,120
In the龍Hi ave, we had a company called W cu manufacturing which is owned entirely and

280
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,080
primer to support all related services in Portugal.

281
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:41,240
We say W cu manufacturing in Brazil is the origin of the W cu equipment by W cu powder

282
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
companies.

283
00:21:42,240 --> 00:22:03,960
Thank you very much.

284
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,640
First, let's talk about our H communicate experience system 1. We took first on our

and 1. We took second on our H

288
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,040
tools, unemployment benefits and education.

289
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,080
The district has a law that beneficial by the

290
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,180
tool has the right to listened

291
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,380
mandatory and is good.

292
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,080
It's emergency, the department of the

293
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,920

the homemade food, it's a good one.

296
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,520
As you saw it with the

297
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,720
city. The people in the city

298
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,640
have a remote

00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,220
people.

301
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,440
So and the

302
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,000

307
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,520
I paid for the

a

311
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,700
They

312
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,640
don't

They

317
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,220
They

318
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,940
don't

319
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,560
For

320
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,840
that

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,900
to the benefits of creature our items.

322
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,260
All of this has been the best time

323
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:11,260
gained from the composition and

324
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,720
environment of our use in woodshed.

325
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,840
This is the reason, especially with the

326
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,800
traditional woodshedそれ doesn't make

327
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,360
a difference for in that condition.

328
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,780
This is what we'reinspecting what

329
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,060
is necessary to do for our

330
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,820
in this field.

331
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,740
If you can simply cover most of your project

332
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,860
with four works at one

333
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,420
and what you can do to divine become more creative.

334
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,640
This information Listen,

335
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,100
is helpful for the positive Чpyot.

336
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,740
That's it opportunities for our burn.

337
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,060
will be the other solutions

338
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,500
for this challenge decision

339
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,520
that I made last year.

340
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,720
You may get your friends

341
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,040
an opportunity for more work

342
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,940
in the next

343
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,760
in your sector.

344
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,640
أك间ش feels somewhat comfortable

345
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,840
Put your hand next to it

346
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,020
Then go ahead

347
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,120
The opposite hand

348
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,120
okay, now

349
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,280
It feels like it's being touched

350
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,000
And it feels a little bit in effect

351
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,220
Like, I feel the support of my family

352
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,580
My family has always been there for me

353
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,280
In public

354
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,760
Now, in addtion

355
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,580
I feel it's gonna be a shift

356
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,720
Yeah, we do

357
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,760
We know a few things
