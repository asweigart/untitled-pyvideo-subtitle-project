1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Thank you so much Guido for being here, for accepting my invitations.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:13,040
Each time I ask you for something, I felt guilty about it.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:20,000
My personal story with Guido, which is related to PyCon US, it was my first ever PyCon in

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,120
Montreal which I mentioned that that's when I heard about Python Core developers through

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,480
Guido's keynote.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,240
By the way, his presentation at the time contains a typo.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,320
Now you know why I'm obsessed with typos.

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:43,080
But it's a special talk to me, talk for me, that's when I realized that there was no female

9
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,160
Core developers at the time.

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,040
And I think that's one of the things that stuck out to me and inspired me to think more

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,440
about that case.

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:02,560
A year later I actually wrote an email to Guido and I felt, I have to admit when I wrote

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:10,040
that email asking him for help, I'm interested in contributing to Python, I felt so scared

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,880
sending that email.

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:25,240
I was like, I thought that I didn't deserve to receive help from Guido van Rossem.

16
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,680
But he replied, and not only he replied, once he continued to support me.

17
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,520
So I'm really grateful that you opened that door for me Guido.

18
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:53,560
Now I left this screen empty because I don't want to call it DM, it sounds sad.

19
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:01,160
Instead I'll share something which I consider my PyCon US chair diary.

20
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,280
Chris messaged that he wished to complain there is not enough Savage Garden playing

21
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,360
in a keynote hall.

22
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,080
And I agree.

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,640
And thank you for raising this.

24
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,320
For those who don't know, I'm a big fan of Savage Garden.

25
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:25,240
I have the opportunity to actually meet Darren Hayes of Savage Garden and the music of Savage

26
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,160
Garden is a comforting music.

27
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,640
And I am stressed out with all of this but I will be listening to the song of Darren

28
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,280
Hayes and Savage Garden.

29
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,680
If you would like to join me you can check out my playlist of Savage Garden and Darren

30
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,800
Hayes.

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,000
And I am so, I feel like, why are you letting me talking about Savage Garden in a Python

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
conference?

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So, well thank you for letting me do that.

34
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,280
Oh my God, oh my God, thank you.

35
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Okay, they're going to cut that out from the recording because of copyrighted music.

36
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
But thank you, I appreciate it.

37
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Thank you, AB team.

38
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
Alright.

39
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Alright.

40
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,280
Regarding the posters, I am so glad that it actually happened.

41
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:57,280
So, I'm so, again, I'm thankful for all the staff members who work hard to make that happen.

42
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,280
So, congratulations again to poster presenters.

43
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,280
Now we've finished almost everything.

44
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,280
What's left is the sprints.

45
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:21,280
And after my message today, Chalmer will be here to be doing the sprint throws.

46
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Basically, they are talking about what's going to happen during the sprints and there will

47
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,280
be introduction of all the different sprint projects.

48
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,280
So, stay tuned after my message.

49
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,280
And during the sprints, it will be starting tomorrow until Thursday, 8 a.m. and 11 p.m.

50
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,280
That's not a typo.

51
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,280
It literally runs all day long.

52
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,280
In rooms 250 and 251, lunch will be included during the sprints.

53
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,280
So, let's check out some stats.

54
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:06,280
And I've been mentioning that, you know, there are 2,000 people joining us in person.

55
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:18,280
And I did not know this fact that what NE can testify that I just got these numbers from them like two hours ago.

56
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,280
1,672 are first-time attendees.

57
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
77%.

58
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,280
So, welcome first-time attendees.

59
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,280
And we have 490 online registrations.

60
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Like that itself is the size of another conference.

61
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
It's big.

62
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:51,280
And about 733 people join in online as well because this time we're allowing, we're letting

63
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,280
in person, people who register in person to also access the online platform.

64
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:07,280
So, in case they are feeling unwell or just need a break from the conference, they can still follow along in a place that's comfortable for them.

65
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,280
And we have 110 people who sign up to do volunteering on site.

66
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,280
Thank you for all the work that you do.

67
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:33,280
This time we have 85 sponsors and we have eight startup roles and nine open source and community booths.

68
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:46,280
Sponsorship brought through those sponsors, it brought us to more than $1 million in sponsorship just for PyCon US.

69
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,280
So, thank you.

70
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Thank you to our vision sponsors for continuing to support PyCon.

71
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:14,280
So, we were able to provide travel grants for people who are not able to attend PyCon US otherwise.

72
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,280
So, 270 people received those grants.

73
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:30,280
And so far we have about $261,000 has been reimbursed for the travel grant recipients so far.

74
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,280
And I think there are still a few more, there are still more that have not come to pick up their grants.

75
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
So, this number will be higher.

76
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
Thank you.

77
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:50,280
Pailadies auction happened last night. We got 29 items that were auctioned.

78
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:58,280
And throughout the history, we received large donations through the auctions.

79
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:06,280
So, you can see the progression of the amount that was, that received during the Pailadies auctions.

80
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:14,280
And last year, last night's result was that we received $35,000 through the bid.

81
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:34,280
The highest bid item was the Zen Side of the Moon vinyl, which brought in $3,000.

82
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:51,280
And I'm really grateful for all of these sponsorships and donations because the impact of all of this is that we get, we get to bring in people.

83
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,280
People who wouldn't be others be here.

84
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:13,280
This year, I received this message from Renato who traveled from Brazil who noted that this year he was able to feasibly notice there are way more women from Brazil that those travel took.

85
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,280
I went to Brazil last year. It took me 30 hours one way.

86
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:27,280
So, it's far. And I'm so glad that so many of you were able to come this year thanks to the sponsorships and the donations.

87
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Thanks to the sponsorship as well. I get to meet another Indonesian woman in this conference and that's Yuri from Japan.

88
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,280
She was born in Indonesia just like myself. So, I was so excited that I ran into her.

89
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,280
I'm so glad that I did not miss the Pailadies lunch today.

90
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:15,280
So, what happens during Pailadies lunch is that all the attendees are encouraged to come up to the front and share things that they are proud of, something they have accomplished.

91
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:26,280
And I hear so many stories, lots of tears. But one of the things that inspired me is that there are so many international people.

92
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:37,280
There are a few people who are here, didn't speak English and had to read from their phone for the translation.

93
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:49,280
And it's the fact that it's okay. The fact that they felt comfortable and accepted to do that, it's so inspiring for me.

94
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:06,280
So, let's check on the PyCon US Challenge. I am wondering how many of you got lots of points.

95
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:15,280
If you want to maybe clap or shout, how many got more than at least five points?

96
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Yeah? Ten points.

97
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:32,280
No? What? Anybody got more than ten points, fifteen points?

98
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Well, I'm disappointed.

99
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:46,280
All right. But you still have till the end of the sprints to do more of this.

100
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:53,280
For this challenge, I really want to just give shout out to people who actually come to the PSF booth and took selfies.

101
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:59,280
It's really fun to see all the photos that you've posted there.

102
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:09,280
I also have more challenge for you in addition to Deb's homework. And this is worth, if you do just one, it's worth lots of points.

103
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:23,280
So, if you can just invite someone else to the next PyCon US and my intention is just for you to tell them about the Python community, introduce them to this community.

104
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:31,280
For myself, I've used Python for a long time, but nobody ever told me about the community.

105
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:44,280
They tell me, like, read this book, read the tutorials, but nobody connected me with the community and I wish for you to extend the invitation, bring someone else to PyCon US.

106
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Encourage someone else into submitting a talk to PyCon US.

107
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Do nominate someone for the PSF Community Service Award, which is also Deb's homework for you.

108
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:02,280
Nominate someone to become a PSF fellow member and attend.

109
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Let's support the Python community worldwide. Go attend a regional Python conference.

110
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:20,280
And you have the whole year to do this and I will be coming back here next year to check on your points.

111
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Yeah, next year. What's going to happen next year?

112
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,280
I have a video to share with you.

113
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:39,280
The word is out. Pittsburgh is a must-see travel destination. Plan a visit and you'll quickly find what makes our city so special.

114
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,280
The experiences and attractions you'll find only in Pittsburgh.

115
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:51,280
That's right. Experiences like the Heinz History Center, the Andy Warhol Museum, the August Wilson African American Cultural Center,

116
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:59,280
the Bicycle Heavens, Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, the National Aviary, the Mattress Factory for Contemporary Art,

117
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,280
our many parks and green spaces. The list goes on.

118
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,280
Take a ride on one of our two iconic and historical inclines to Mount Washington,

119
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:13,280
where you can pair a delicious meal with incredible views at one of the many restaurants that line Grandview Avenue.

120
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,280
And be sure to head into a few of our 90 unique neighborhoods for local flavors,

121
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:24,280
like a Primanti Brothers Sandwich, handmade pierogies or Pittsburgh salad piled high with fresh-cut fries.

122
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Visit the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum or the Roberto Clemente Museum.

123
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,280
And be sure to check out a few of our only in Pittsburgh breweries.

124
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,280
Pick up a Pittsburgh Brewery Guide to help you build your ideal brewery tour.

125
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:45,280
And that's just a start. Yes, all this and much more. Only in Pittsburgh. See you soon.

126
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Yes. So next year we will move to Pittsburgh.

127
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:03,280
And the next PyCon US is 2024, May 15 to May 23rd.

128
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:10,280
And 2025, we will also be in Pittsburgh from May 14 to May 22nd.

129
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,280
And here's a cheat sheet because I want you to go to the regional PyCons.

130
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,280
I give you a list so you can just choose any one of them. If you can go to multiple, that's even great.

131
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,280
So there are so many PyCons all over the world.

132
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,280
There's even lots of PyCons in the APAC region as well.

133
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,280
So check them out.

134
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:41,280
And I want to thank our vendors, especially the AV team, Altitude C.

135
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:47,280
They're doing an amazing job coordinating with me and with all the speakers, with all the keynote speakers.

136
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,280
And I feel like everything is so great. It looks so fancy. So great.

137
00:15:52,280 --> 00:16:01,280
So thank you. Thank you, AV team. Thank you, Altitude C.

138
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:11,280
And thank you, White Coat Captioning, for providing live captioning to all of our talks and keynotes and lightning talks.

139
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,280
To visit Salt Lake who came through and helped us with the poster printing situation.

140
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:23,280
They contacted different hotels. We went to contact different hotels to see who had printers.

141
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:30,280
So because of that, poster session happened today. Thank you.

142
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:43,280
And to Lux Furniture who provided the furnishing for the quiet room. It's really like comfortable, quiet space.

143
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:53,280
And Georgie, who actually all of the graphics, you see the videos, the animation, she did all of that.

144
00:16:53,280 --> 00:17:02,280
So she's really amazing. So yeah, Georgie.

145
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:23,280
So first of all, I really want to thank you all for giving me this opportunity to be here and showing my part of myself to you and that you actually accepted all of that.

146
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:33,280
I'm so grateful for that. I have one more gift that I want to share with you.

147
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:44,280
I used to work in a movie company.

148
00:17:44,280 --> 00:18:01,280
And one of the things they did after the movie production finished, they would invite all of us, like everybody who worked in the movie, we get to bring our families, go to the theater, actually watch the movie.

149
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,280
And at the end of the movie, everybody would stay and watch the credits.

150
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,280
Everybody who worked on it, they watched the credits and I even get to bring my kids with me.

151
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,280
They get to see my name in the end of Angry Birds movie and one of the Spider-Man movie.

152
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:29,280
So it's really cool and it's cool experience. I want for you to have that kind of experience as well.

153
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:39,280
So for this next part, what I like for you, if you see yourself on the screen, please stand up.

154
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:48,280
If you see someone who you recognize, who you know, and by know I don't mean, oh I know him, I know this person, I went to dinner with them.

155
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:54,280
It's just you know this person. You recognize, you say you went to a talk given by this person.

156
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,280
You saw them volunteering. That's good enough that you know this person.

157
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:08,280
Please clap. Alright, those are the two things. So let's play the video.

158
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,280
Oh

159
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,280
Oh

160
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
Oh

161
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,280
Oh

162
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,280
Oh

163
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,280
Oh

164
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,280
Oh

165
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,280
Oh

166
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
Oh

167
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,280
Thank you so much.

168
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:58,280
Thank you again for celebrating 20 years of PyCon with all of us. Thank you. Alright.

169
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:12,280
And that concludes all the talks and keynotes. I will have Chalmer doing the sprint throws right now. Thank you all.

170
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:31,280
Alright. If you are leading a sprint this week, we would love to have you come up and introduce your sprint to the folks who are here.

171
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,280
I know some people are going to go out and go get food and all that, but some people want to stick around and hear what sprints are going to happen.

172
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:49,280
You'll have as a sprint lead about 30 seconds to give the name of your sprint, what your sprint covers, and whether you feel that your sprint is beginner friendly.

173
00:22:49,280 --> 00:23:01,280
For those who have never been to a sprint and are not sure what to expect, I'll be leading an introduction to sprinting workshop immediately after these folks get done talking about their sprints.

174
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,280
So it will happen in about 10 minutes. You can follow me to the room because it won't start until I get there.

175
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:17,280
If you want to dash out, the room will be room 151G. Again, the workshop is in 151G.

176
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:23,280
And with that, the sprints will start at 8 o'clock tomorrow.

177
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:35,280
I will caveat that. Your sprint lead may not believe that, and they may choose to show up at 9 or 10 or 11. He says 12.

178
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:45,280
Alright. So with that, I'll turn the time over to the folks. About 30 seconds and let people know what you got going on.

179
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:51,280
Hi. If you're not staying for sprints this year, you should definitely do that next year.

180
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,280
It's one of the best parts of the conference. You get to actually work directly live with maintainers of software you're using.

181
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:07,280
So highly recommended. I'm from CPython here. We're going to be sprinting all four days, knowing Larry Hastings until the very end of the day when they will kick us out.

182
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:15,280
Those are not mentor sprints, but if you have an issue that you would like fixing and you have an idea how you would approach it, it's the perfect time to do this.

183
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,280
So I highly recommend you talk to us tomorrow.

184
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:35,280
Hi. I'm Mark. I'm a GNU Mailman core developer. We'll be sprinting on Mailman all four days.

185
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:47,280
I'll be here. We have issues on Mailman core and our Django based web UIs. If you want to help with Mailman, we'd love to have you come by.

186
00:24:51,280 --> 00:25:04,280
Hi. I'm Russell Keith McGee. We will be with the Beware project. We'll be sprinting on Briefcase, our tool for packaging Python code as a standalone app, and also on Toga, our GUI toolkit for cross platform GUI development.

187
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:16,280
We are particularly interested if you've got web skills because we need to build out our web back end. And when we have tasks for people of all levels of skill, and we do mean all levels of skill, and everyone who contributes gets a challenge coin.

188
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,280
So please come along.

189
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Hello. I'm Shauna. I'm going to be sprinting on a new project called the Open Source Governance Project. It's an effort to collect governance wisdom, advice, resources, et cetera, and make them available to projects.

190
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:42,280
It is a good sprint for people who are not looking to do code contributions, so writers, community managers, and governance nerds of all kinds.

191
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:54,280
I also want to extend an invitation to anyone who is working on a different sprint or a different project who has a governance problem that they want advice on to come stop by our sprint, get some advice. We'll be happy to chat with you.

192
00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Hello. My name is Eric. I'll be working on a project called Django Symbol Deploy. It automates people's Django deployments and is platform agnostic. If you deal with Django deployments in any capacity, please stop by and say hello.

193
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,280
I'd be happy to just talk to you about it, give a demo. If you want to help out, contributions are welcome. I'll be here through Wednesday. Thank you.

194
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:22,280
Hi, I'm Jackie. I'm leading a sprint for a project I lead called Mesa, which is agent-based modeling in Python.

195
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:38,280
Recently, I did a review of literature that had used Mesa, which I thought was quite impactful, which includes COVID disease research, tumor growth, social robots for dementia patients, climate change, renewable energy markets, smart grid attacks, water security, truck and motor vehicles, and so on.

196
00:26:38,280 --> 00:27:06,280
IOT network modeling, smart contract modeling, blockchain supply chains, all the chains, energetic genetic engineered insects, post disaster resource allocation, simulations for malware spread and decentralization, decentralized public key infrastructure for autonomous embedded systems.

197
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:23,280
So if you're interested in any of those things, you should come and visit me. It's just going to be me. I have a variety of work, including small feature ads, PR reviews, creating examples, speed scale improvements, geospatial improvements, and automating more stuff. Thank you.

198
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:40,280
I'll be sprinting on PEP669, the new monitoring API in CPython. If anyone's interested in porting profilers, debuggers, or anything to it, or just helping out with the documentation or anything like that, it would be much appreciated.

199
00:27:40,280 --> 00:28:06,280
Hello, I'm Katnay, and I will be hosting a sprint for CircuitPython, which is a version of Python that runs on tiny computers called microcontrollers. We have a ton of libraries, over 300, and I have hardware to test most of them. We have something like 670 issues available. 76 of those are labeled good first issue, which is to say they are great for beginners.

200
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:19,280
You are also welcome to join us if you're simply interested in CircuitPython. We can accommodate folks who just want to learn about it, and we're happy to help you contribute to the project as well. We will be here Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and I hope to see you all there.

201
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:45,280
Hi, I'm Chris from the Pants Build project. We work on the PEX executable format and the Pants Build system. We will be both sprinting on pants tomorrow, and also we're around to help people integrate pants into their open source repos and just generally helping out people get started with pants. So come find us tomorrow if you're interested in that. Thanks.

202
00:28:49,280 --> 00:29:02,280
My name is Jukka. We will be sprinting on MyPy and MyPyC on Monday and Tuesday, and we welcome new contributors. We have a list of easy issues to get started with.

203
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:25,280
Hello all, I'm Dave, and this is the largest number of seats I've ever spoken to. But in addition to that, I'm with the Conda project. We're going to have a Conda and Friends sprint on Monday and Tuesday. If you're interested in packaging, please join us. If you're interested in the future of Conda and the whole ecosystem, please join us.

204
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:35,280
And I'd like to point out that Conda sprints are about expanding the contributor community, not so much about contributions in those two days. So if you're looking for a beginner project, please join us. Thank you.

205
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:57,280
Hi, everybody. I'm Nick with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and we're going to work on a package called Hive, which is a simulator for electric vehicle fleets. We do have beginner friendly issues and other general issues as well as some rust stuff if you're interested. Thank you.

206
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:20,280
Hey, I'm Matt. I'm going to be here tomorrow and maybe Tuesday working on MemRay and on PyStack. MemRay is a memory profiler. PyStack is a debugging tool that lets you see what a running process is doing. I have spent the entire day trying to groom good first issues for people, so I will be very offended if no one shows up.

207
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:42,280
Hello, everyone. My name is Patrick. I'm going to be sprinting on Strawberry GraphQL, which is a library based on data classes and type ins and loves UK GraphQL servers. I'm going to work on a plan for version one, which has been a while now, and documentation and probably the new website. If you want to join, let me know. Thank you.

208
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,280
Thank you.

209
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:54,280
Strawberry GraphQL.

210
00:30:54,280 --> 00:31:15,280
Hello, everyone. My name is Fabio, and I'm a maintainer of PyScript. We will be running a PyScript and friends sprint, mainly working on PyScript, documentation, examples, but we also have a new framework called PiperCard that you can contribute to. It allows you to write applications with S cards.

211
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:38,280
We also want to welcome everyone that wants to write examples, break code, try Python on the browser. Come work with us. If you haven't heard of it, PyScript is a framework platform that allows you to run Python on the browser. So everyone is welcome. See you there. Thank you.

212
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:53,280
Hi, everyone. My name is Zach. I maintain Hypothesis. If you have used Hypothesis, I have a number of really exciting issues for adding new features. Unfortunately, my good issues for beginners in open source got used up at the mentor sprints yesterday, so none of those left.

213
00:31:53,280 --> 00:32:13,280
But I do have some fantastic impactful things for web developers to do, for people who write documentation or people who would like to add features to Hypothesis. Those who contribute get these adorable little dragonfly badges that I have stickers for everyone who wants them. Thanks very much.

214
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:34,280
Hi, I'm Junji from South Korea. I think some of you may have heard of my talk about AI Monitor Next Generation. So I'm going to host a sprint for AI Monitor and I think I will relate topics such as Task Group extensions and so on on Monday and Tuesday. Thank you.

215
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:46,280
Hi, I'm Samuel from Pydantic. We'll be sprinting on Pydantic V2. Come along if you want to contribute or have any questions. Thank you.

216
00:32:46,280 --> 00:33:08,280
Hello, I'm Eric from Read the Docs and we have a lot of cool stuff that we're working on to make it easier to host documentation for your open source projects. So we're not so much working on our project, but helping you improve your documentation and get it hosted on our platform. Or if you have kind of Sphinx docs questions, we're going to be there to help you kind of basically make the documentation in the Python ecosystem better. So thank you.

217
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:29,280
Alright, thank you folks. Appreciate all the sprint leads. I'm going to walk over to room 151G, 151 Gamma and I'm going to teach an introduction to sprinting workshop. If you want to go, follow me there. Otherwise, I'll see you tomorrow when you get here. Look forward to all your shiny happy faces making lots of cool fixes.
