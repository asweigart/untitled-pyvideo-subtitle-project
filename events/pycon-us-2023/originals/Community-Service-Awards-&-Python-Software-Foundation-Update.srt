1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Our next speaker will be Deb Nicholson from the Python Software Foundation who will be

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:13,520
providing updates from the PSF and rewarding the Community Service Award.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,800
Thanks, Mariana.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,600
All right.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,600
All right.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,600
Get the clicker set up.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,720
I had better luck with my Linux than Spot did.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,720
Never suspend.

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,080
Just leave it running.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,860
So if you were here last year, I also was on this stage, but I didn't know what I was

11
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,700
or what was going on because I had been here for about three weeks.

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,980
So this is me coming back to you a year later to kind of tell you how the first year has

13
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,100
gone.

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,760
And it has really been quite a year.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,580
So the first thing that happens when you tell people you're the executive director at the

16
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,540
Python Software Foundation is that everybody tells you what they use Python for.

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,540
Like everyone.

18
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,540
Literally everyone.

19
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,220
So I live in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

20
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,100
It's a place with a lot of biotech.

21
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,260
There's people doing gene sequencing.

22
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,500
There's people doing all kinds of astrophysics.

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,860
We have lots and lots of people in the neighborhood who it turns out all use Python.

24
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:33,180
So when I tell you everyone tells me what they're using Python for, I mean like everyone.

25
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,920
Like everyone I meet.

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,460
So I'm going to give you a couple examples.

27
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,420
This one is maybe there's a lot of folks in the audience that already do this, but I thought

28
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,420
it was cool.

29
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,180
Oh, you use it to talk to your Nest thermostat.

30
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,900
Like you save a little money on your heating bill.

31
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,900
Cool.

32
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,620
Making electronic music.

33
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,620
I already knew a lot of people that made electronic music, but now they tell me they're using Python

34
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,620
for it.

35
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,260
So that's cool.

36
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,100
Manipulating space telescope data.

37
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,260
You probably knew this if you watched Sarah Isiyoun's keynote last year.

38
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,660
She did the James Webb telescope picture of the black hole.

39
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,900
I don't know if you saw it recently got sharpened up so it looks a little more like a bagel

40
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,420
than a donut.

41
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,340
But it turns out there are a lot of people that work on that Webb telescope data.

42
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,220
And then even in Cambridge there are people who are working on other space telescopes.

43
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:30,660
So the Chandra telescope also gets to talk to us on Earth via Python.

44
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,540
And then I also met someone who said I'm making our school's website display the information

45
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,540
it needs to.

46
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,500
We have a lot of schools in Cambridge like Harvard, MIT, some other less common ones

47
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,020
that you may not have heard of.

48
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,820
But a lot of them are using Python to talk to their websites.

49
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,700
Probably not surprising, right?

50
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,540
This one I thought was really cool.

51
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:58,880
Someone told me they're using Python to create reports to find out how workers in the field

52
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,060
they work in are being treated so that they can advocate for better conditions.

53
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:10,540
So the first kind of step to advocating for change is like describing what the problem

54
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,700
is and what's actually happening.

55
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,860
So I feel pretty good about this.

56
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,460
Someone's using Python to improve working conditions.

57
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,820
This one, though, is my favorite.

58
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:27,700
I met someone who said I'm organizing my experiment data to see how we're doing at curing pediatric

59
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,980
cancer with Python.

60
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,180
That to me is pretty amazing.

61
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,740
I want to take a minute.

62
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,260
We made a programming language that's accessible and easy to use.

63
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,760
So even when you're working on a really hard problem like this, we're helping them organize

64
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,540
that data and become more effective and efficient at curing pediatric cancer.

65
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,700
And you know, fuck cancer.

66
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,340
Like I said, it's been a year.

67
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:06,260
So what else have I learned this year?

68
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:14,900
The other thing that I learned is that almost nobody knows what the PSF is.

69
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,900
Maybe this room not included, but maybe, I don't know.

70
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,500
How many people do know what the PSF is?

71
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,340
This might be an easy one because Carol just talked this up really good, which was amazing.

72
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,780
Okay.

73
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,820
So someone said to me, you said you work in a nonprofit, but Python is a company.

74
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,340
And I was like, it is not.

75
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,300
You called me a liar, but also you're wrong.

76
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,940
This is a bunch of people, like I was at a nonprofit fundraiser, the YWCA in my town,

77
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,620
and everyone's like, oh, I work at a nonprofit.

78
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,400
It turns out everyone who works at nonprofits goes to other nonprofits' fundraisers.

79
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,960
So it's like this big circle where we all donate to each other's work.

80
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,840
And I had said I also work at a nonprofit.

81
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,400
And she was like, you do not.

82
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,600
So this one was really funny.

83
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,280
It was like the Python Software Foundation.

84
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,360
There's one organization in charge of the whole thing.

85
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,840
And I was like, where did you think it came from?

86
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
Like photosynthesis?

87
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,360
It just kind of like arrived.

88
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,360
And it magically works really well, even though there's no coordinating bodies or organizations.

89
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,840
That's what faith in humanity you have.

90
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,520
And then this one, I've worked at a couple small nonprofits and I've gotten this one

91
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
a lot.

92
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
There's only nine or ten of you.

93
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,640
I'm like, yeah.

94
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:40,600
To that one, I have to say we are a small but mighty staff with an amazing community

95
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
of volunteers.

96
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,040
So otherwise, we would not be able to get all that much done.

97
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,400
So just to kind of like what the PSF does.

98
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
That's my job.

99
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
I work here.

100
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,600
That's what the PSF does.

101
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,440
We're the vendor neutral community-driven home of the Python programming language.

102
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,600
So that means that we make sure that Python remains a place like an open source language

103
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,280
that anyone can participate in, it's accessible, and that it is always out in the open and

104
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,080
that all of the access remains there for anyone.

105
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,720
We also support and facilitate the growth of a diverse community of Python programmers.

106
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,360
So that means that we're always looking to grow the universe of people who are using

107
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,000
Python.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,880
We want to come find you all over the world and help you install Python, wherever you

109
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,440
are.

110
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,560
So in nuts and bolts, we also host massive infrastructure.

111
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,280
On average, a version of Python is downloaded over 300 million times per day.

112
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:49,320
And in 2022, PyPI saw 57% growth in download counts and bandwidth alike.

113
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,240
So remember I said there's like nine or ten of us.

114
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,120
We don't all work on this infrastructure.

115
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,400
Only two of us work on infrastructure, and the rest of all of that is done by volunteers.

116
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,680
So we also give out grants.

117
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,440
I love this part, too, because it's like the nonprofit that gives to other nonprofits.

118
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,080
Like I really like that recursion loop.

119
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:17,880
So we find other Python projects or user groups or workshops or smaller PyCons in other places,

120
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,760
and we give out grants to them.

121
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:27,500
So in 2022, we gave out 152 grants, over $200,000, and we gave grants to 42 different countries

122
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,400
on six different continents.

123
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,120
So if you know who's doing a PyCon in Antarctica, we want to hear from you, because we have

124
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,400
one continent left.

125
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,520
So we also act as a fiscal umbrella for other Python projects.

126
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,440
So that means like some of them are projects like Palettes or Flask, and then others are

127
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,320
meetups or other PyCons like PyCascades or the Boston Python Meetup.

128
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,440
And they work to grow Python and expand the community, and the global network of Palettes

129
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,520
chapters is also under our fiscal umbrella now, which is awesome.

130
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,440
And we help them with back office.

131
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,360
We help them with their banking and accounting.

132
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,040
We help them figure out how to do budgets and road mapping and how to do paperwork

133
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
and how to read contracts.

134
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,960
I don't know if you've ever read venue contracts, but if you have trouble sleeping, I highly

135
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,280
recommend them.

136
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,840
So we do that for our fiscal sponsories.

137
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,560
And we sleep great.

138
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,160
We also put PyCon US, this conference you're all at.

139
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,240
Are you having a good time at PyCon?

140
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,160
Yes.

141
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,320
So this year, we are 2200 people attending in person.

142
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,840
I can't see any of you out there, so I'm going to assume you're all out there.

143
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,200
And there are over 400 people attending online.

144
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,280
So last year when I came on this stage, someone had mentioned to me, it's kind of sad that

145
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,800
the hybrid experience is going to be a little less fun this year.

146
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,560
And I said, we should fix that.

147
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,640
So I wonder if we could kind of say hello to all the people watching via Hublot at home.

148
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,440
Hello, online friends.

149
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
We miss you.

150
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,640
We're thinking of you.

151
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,600
We also this year on the PyCon online, we added a Spanish language virtual chat room

152
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,320
so that we could moderate conversations in both English and Spanish.

153
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,480
So that is very exciting.

154
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,080
We owe all of that to Georgie Kerr, who is a powerhouse wherever she is.

155
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,560
She's probably busy doing five more things.

156
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,240
And then we brought back PyCon active.

157
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,120
So if you got to do any yoga this weekend, hooray.

158
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,960
A little bit of stretching after three days of sitting in these chairs, not bad.

159
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,520
All right.

160
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:59,240
So we've been putting on PyCon US for 20 years, which is a long time to be doing the same

161
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,640
thing.

162
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,360
I don't even think there are people doing graduate programs that long.

163
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,600
Or maybe someone in this room.

164
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
You can come tell me.

165
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,800
You don't have to out yourself.

166
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,320
But that means that this weekend has been really special.

167
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,000
People have been telling me stories about their first PyCon or stories about when they

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,920
met someone and they're like, I think I might stay here forever.

169
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
It's so nice.

170
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,000
Everyone's been so fantastic.

171
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,920
And we've been doing that pretty much for 20 years.

172
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,920
So yay, us.

173
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:42,480
So I have some news and growth about what's going on at the foundation itself.

174
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,160
This year, earlier this year, we said goodbye to Jackie Augustine.

175
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,940
She's sort of semi-retiring and not doing event work anymore.

176
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,000
We miss her a lot, but we still had a PyCon to run.

177
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,720
So we hired Sarah, our new community events manager, who started in February.

178
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
This event is in April.

179
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,360
She started in February.

180
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,560
And she's gotten up to speed on everything very quickly.

181
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,280
And she's probably going to take a two-week-long nap after this.

182
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,000
So welcome, Sarah.

183
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yay.

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Thank you.

185
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,160
That means that we also promoted Olivia to program director, which means she took the

186
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,400
lead on organizing PyCon US this year.

187
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,760
The whole thing.

188
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
Thank you, Olivia.

189
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,640
We're going to...

190
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,560
This is coming in the future.

191
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,800
We're going to be hiring our first-ever community communications manager.

192
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,400
So you should watch for that posting next month.

193
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,760
That means that we're going to be talking a lot more about what's going on in the community

194
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,960
on our blog.

195
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,760
We're going to be reaching out to you and asking you to tell us your stories, share

196
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,540
your events, share your CFPs, tell us everything that's going on.

197
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:59,620
We want to have a clearinghouse of all the information and stuff that's going on in the

198
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,420
Python community in one place so you can come and find out what's going on.

199
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,740
So if you move, we'll help you find your new Python community.

200
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,980
So that's going to be a post.

201
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,820
You may have seen Spot this morning.

202
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,220
We're going to be hiring our first-ever safety and security engineer for PyPI.

203
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,940
And that post is already up.

204
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:25,140
That means instead of 88% volunteer work on PyPI, we're going to have a staff person whose

205
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,100
job it is, which is really exciting.

206
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,580
So thank you, AWS, for that.

207
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:40,140
And we're welcoming Lukasz back for a third year as the C Python developer in residence.

208
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,140
Everyone loves Lukasz, so thank you, Meta, for funding him for another year.

209
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:56,100
And we're going to be hiring a deputy developer in residence to join him on C Python.

210
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,420
So that posting is also going to be up in the next month or so.

211
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,140
So thank you, Bloomberg, for making that possible.

212
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,780
We could probably use like four Lukasz's, but I think we'll just have to settle for two.

213
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:18,020
So we're also very close to choosing a security developer in residence who's going to be making

214
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,340
security recommendations and doing an audit for all of our workflows and infrastructure

215
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,620
on both sides, like on the C Python and the PyPI side.

216
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:31,740
And that is all thanks to Alpha Omega, which is an open SSF project that is just looking

217
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:37,500
to figure out how do we do open source security in massive public projects.

218
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,580
And so we're really excited that that person is going to be joining us soon, but I can't

219
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,700
tell you their name because we didn't pick them yet.

220
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,820
So we'll clap again when we get to say who it is.

221
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,340
But not today.

222
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,980
So I have a little PyCon US gratitude that I would like to share.

223
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,660
I'm just going to make you clap the whole time, just so you know.

224
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,820
Oh, yeah, yeah.

225
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,820
Don't worry.

226
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,900
There's going to be more chances.

227
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,660
So I want to say thank you to all of our speakers.

228
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,140
So if we didn't have speakers, well, I don't know what we'd be doing.

229
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,380
I used to be hallway track, but it really wouldn't be the same conference.

230
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,740
So thank you to all of our speakers.

231
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:25,220
I also want to say thank you to all of our program volunteers.

232
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:32,180
And these are sort of like, you know, like high level volunteers that help us run a CFP,

233
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,020
either for the poster track or one of the talk tracks.

234
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,260
And then they organize another whole cadre of volunteers to look at all the proposals,

235
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,200
sift through them, and then decide what gets to come and be here at PyCon.

236
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,900
And then they do all this communication with all the speakers, schedule them to make sure

237
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,400
all the rooms make sense and that people are going to be here on the days that they're

238
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
going to be speaking.

239
00:14:53,400 --> 00:15:02,600
So thank you to all of our program chairs and volunteers.

240
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,760
And thank you to all of our tutorial presenters.

241
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,680
Did anyone go to their tutorial and learn something cool earlier this week?

242
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
Yay!

243
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
Yay learning!

244
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:17,320
And thank you to all of our on-site volunteers.

245
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,920
You probably saw them at registration, at the PSF booth, in the green room as session

246
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,600
chairs, carting things from one room to another, helping us arrange beanbag chairs, like so

247
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
many things.

248
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,120
And those are the glamorous tasks.

249
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,680
There are so many other less glamorous tasks that we had on-site volunteers help us with.

250
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,120
So thank you to our on-site volunteers.

251
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,880
And then thank you to our online volunteers.

252
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:53,560
So I mentioned that we had Spanish language moderation and we also have English chat moderation.

253
00:15:53,560 --> 00:16:01,040
There are like I think 40 or 50 people moderating some part of PyCon online this weekend.

254
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,080
And so thank you online volunteers.

255
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:12,440
I don't know why I feel like they're out there behind us, but anyway.

256
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,200
And then thank you to Marietta.

257
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,200
She — yay!

258
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Yes.

259
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:31,080
Marietta brought like a really beautiful vision of what PyCon should be and she made it happen

260
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,340
and she had to show up for like probably 100 meetings along the way and she doesn't even

261
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,340
work here.

262
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:48,400
So thank you, Marietta, for everything that you've done this year.

263
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,120
And then this is the PSF staff who amazingly let me post these pictures of them that I

264
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,760
took this weekend while they're all sleep deprived.

265
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,740
But like I said, we have an amazing staff of people.

266
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:05,540
Some people were too busy for me to even catch, but you probably saw them working the auction,

267
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,260
at the booth, that's the back office, people at registration.

268
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:15,980
I like to joke that when you work at a small nonprofit, like everyone has five jobs.

269
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,980
But when you work at the PSF during PyCon, you have like 10.

270
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:25,220
So I want to say a hearty thank you to the PSF staff for this past week.

271
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:36,460
And oh, and then this one is for you.

272
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,540
You get to clap for yourselves because if we did all this work and no one showed up,

273
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,620
what fun would that be?

274
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:52,820
So thank you to all of you for coming to PyCon US and making an amazing event.

275
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,820
We hope you'll join us in Pittsburgh next year.

276
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,900
Pittsburgh is real different from Salt Lake in a couple of ways.

277
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,060
I wanted to share this picture so you know that it's humid there.

278
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,060
So that's nice.

279
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,140
Also, all of our trans friends are going to be able to come and join us and not feel weird

280
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,140
about it.

281
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,140
So that's even better.

282
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:22,980
I just hope Pittsburgh is ready for us.

283
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,240
All right.

284
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,720
So your homework until Pittsburgh, it's not too bad.

285
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,960
Keep telling us how we're doing.

286
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,160
We do this for you.

287
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,560
So like, you know, if you hate chocolate and we bake you a chocolate cake, you should tell

288
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,280
us you hate chocolate.

289
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,480
Like, we're doing this for the community.

290
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,160
So if we're not doing it right, we want to hear from you.

291
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,440
Or you can also tell us if we are doing it right.

292
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,000
That might soften the blow on the other comments.

293
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,040
So feel free to tell us the other way, too.

294
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,120
And then keep telling everyone you know how much you love Python and the Python community.

295
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,080
That's probably the easiest one.

296
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,560
And then this one is important.

297
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,480
That's why I put it in bold.

298
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,840
Keep telling your bosses to financially support our work.

299
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,560
Yes.

300
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,360
So like, when you get that, like, oh, this PSF thing, should we do it?

301
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,480
I want you to run in and be like, yes, let me count the ways.

302
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,120
You definitely should do it.

303
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,320
Or you can have them talk to me.

304
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,040
I'll do that.

305
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,200
The other thing I want to say, so this, we add someone approach and say, can I help you

306
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,000
get more individual members?

307
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,960
So this is Dan Furman.

308
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,760
Every PyCon I am amazed and humbled by how many cool things are being built by the community.

309
00:19:45,760 --> 00:20:00,080
So in this spirit, he is pledging a $25 match from right now to the first 20 PSF supporting

310
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,520
members sign up for renewals.

311
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,640
These are financial memberships.

312
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,840
So please become a supporting member today and help us take Dan's money.

313
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,360
So thank you, Dan, for letting us take your money.

314
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,680
We do have other memberships.

315
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,980
This is how you become a supporting member.

316
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,120
We do have also contributing and managing memberships that you can find information

317
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,400
on here.

318
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,880
And all of those memberships, whether financial or not, enable you to vote in our board elections,

319
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,800
which are going to be coming up in June.

320
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,280
This is a great time to start thinking about if you want to run for our board.

321
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,800
And in fact, this very room is a great place to ask, hey, do you think I should run for

322
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,080
the PSF board?

323
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,120
Because I think we have like 40 current and former board members in the audience.

324
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,640
So if you become a member, you get to vote in the board election or you could run for

325
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
the board.

326
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,440
You know, Carol is a former board member and she was amazing.

327
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:13,960
So finally, your last piece of homework, and this is my very obvious segue, which is a

328
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,660
very obvious segue to the three people who are getting a community service award in person

329
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,720
tonight to come up closer.

330
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,400
But I also want all of you to think about who we should honor with a community service

331
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
award.

332
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
We can't be everywhere.

333
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,600
We don't see all the amazing things that you see happening in the community.

334
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,400
So if you see someone doing something amazing and you would like to see them honored with

335
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,400
a community service award, you have to tell us.

336
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,120
So that completes your homework.

337
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,440
And now we're going to do a couple of community service awards.

338
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,360
The first few are for folks that were not able to join us in person.

339
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,080
And then the last three, you know who you are.

340
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,000
I hope it's I can't really see out there.

341
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Hopefully you're nearby.

342
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,400
Otherwise I'll call your name and we'll, I don't know, do jokes or dance or Macarena

343
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
or something.

344
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:13,400
So I'm going to make sure we get these read correctly because I have notes.

345
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,600
All right.

346
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:23,920
So the first award goes to John Holley, Matthew Lago, and James Loebman for many years of

347
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,720
volunteering on behalf of the PSF to support students and their mentors working on Python

348
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,760
projects via Google Summer of Code.

349
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:43,440
Thank you for your service to the community.

350
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,760
The next award goes to Philip James for all his contributions to the Python community,

351
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,980
most notably his stewardship of the PSF's Code of Conduct workgroup as the workgroup's

352
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,260
chair for its first four years.

353
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:07,580
So thank you, Philip, for your service to the community.

354
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:13,420
The next award goes to Patrick Ben Cotter for his many years serving as the postmaster

355
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:19,220
for mail.python.org and supporting the Python community mailing list and the PSF's email

356
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,220
traffic.

357
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,820
So thank you, Patrick, for your service.

358
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:33,140
And then the in-person awards.

359
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,900
I don't see if anyone is nearby.

360
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,900
I'm going to call your name, then we're going to wait for the longest time.

361
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,900
Okay.

362
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,900
I'll read.

363
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,180
How about we'll do it like the Price is Right where I talk as they come down the aisle.

364
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,580
Okay.

365
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:52,860
So the first in-person award goes to Ned Diley for his contributions.

366
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,860
We can clap for him twice.

367
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:11,380
Thank you so much, Ned.

368
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:16,220
This is for your contributions as the macOS release manager since Python 3.2 and the release

369
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:20,940
manager for Python 3.6 and 3.7.

370
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,940
Thank you, Ned.

371
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:33,140
The next one is going to be awfully familiar.

372
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,140
We're bringing Carol Willing back up to the stage.

373
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,940
We didn't let you get very far.

374
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:02,620
This is for your work as a Python core developer and for your years of service on the Python

375
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,620
Steering Council.

376
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:10,940
I suspect it's also just for being you and being amazing, but I didn't write up the nomination.

377
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,340
There are probably several.

378
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,340
Anyway, thank you so much, Carol.

379
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:31,700
And then we have a Distinguished Service Award.

380
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:37,140
The Distinguished Service Award is a little bit more of a lifetime achievement award.

381
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,820
You can come and hang out for a couple of years, but if you sort of put in decades and

382
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:47,900
decades, then we give you a different award, which is our Distinguished Service Award.

383
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,900
So this one is going to Naomi Cedar.

384
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,900
Oh.

385
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,900
Here, we'll come over here.

386
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,900
All right.

387
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,900
It's fine.

388
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,900
We'll do a little square dance first.

389
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:10,540
It is my great honor to give you this award for your many decades of service.

390
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:17,260
Naomi exemplifies the ethos of be like create the community that you want to see.

391
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:23,340
You consistently take on these hard things that don't exist yet, and then we keep doing

392
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:28,620
them because after they come into existence, we can't imagine the community without them.

393
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:33,100
So this award is for decades of service to the PSF and the Python community as a board

394
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:38,020
member, chair of the board, and advocate on behalf of underrepresented people all over

395
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,020
the world.

396
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,020
Thank you.

397
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,020
Thank you, Naomi.

398
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,260
Thank you.

399
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,260
All right.

400
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,260
Oh.

401
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:59,340
Actually on time this time, I think.

402
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,660
And there's no way to top that.

403
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,100
So thank you so much.

404
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,660
If you have questions about the PSF or you want to ever talk to me, you can reach out

405
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,660
to me on the interwebs.

406
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,860
You can email me, deb at python.org, and I would be happy to talk with you more about

407
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,860
the PSF.

408
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,540
So thank you, and enjoy the next talk.

409
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,260
Thank you.
