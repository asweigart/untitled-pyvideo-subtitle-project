00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I think that's a very good question.

245
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I think that's a very good question.

246
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I think that's a very good question.

247
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I think that's a very good question.

248
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I think that's a very good question.

249
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I think that's a very good question.

250
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think that's a very good question.

251
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I think that's a very good question.

252
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I think that's a very good question.

253
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I think that's a very good question.

254
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I think that's a very good question.

255
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I think that's a very good question.

256
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I think that's a very good question.

257
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I think that's a very good question.

258
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think that's a very good question.

259
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I think that's a very good question.

260
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I think that's a very good question.

261
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So it's a very good question.

262
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So it's a very good question.

263
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I think that's a very good question.

264
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I think Debbie sausage.

265
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So it's a very good question.

266
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I think that's a very good question.

267
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I think that's a very good question.

268
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I think that's a very good question.

269
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So it's a very good question.

270
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:59,040
So if you look at these gaps drawn on the side by the

271
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
ball, which is a very long and very broad circle down

272
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So, the overall situation is just that it's the only place to do this.

273
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So, the problem is that you know, because they're driven by experience,

274
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
so it's not easy to do this to raise up the level of improvement.

275
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So, you have to set up your own experience.

276
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So, first, if you want to set up your experience,

277
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
you must have a good, well-fixed profile.

278
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So, you need to set up your own profile, so you can do that.

279
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So, the first one, the community's view,

280
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
that first is not as good as the other two.

281
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So, if we're truly in the middle of a whole range of things,

282
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
it should be fine.

283
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
All you have to do is ask them, you can tell them,

284
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
you're going to be a good student,

285
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
also you need to find a good student,

286
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and you'll find a good student.

287
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Of course, it's like a list of other things that you need to do.

288
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So, I expect you to try this in writing, but anyway,

289
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
it's not really about the things that you just want to do,

290
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
it's about the things that you want to do.

291
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And it's a very effective remedy,

292
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
because when you're somebody who's in a relationship with somebody,

293
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
you want to actually, you know,

294
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
play with the people you've been spoke with,

295
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and it makes for a good profile.

296
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So, you need to have a good, well-fixed profile.

297
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So, you need to have a good profile,

298
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and you have to be able to do the work that's being requested

299
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
for the users.

300
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So, it's about the people that you've been speaking to,

301
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and the people that you've heard about.

302
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So, the second thing is to be just a good,

303
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
you know, a good person.

304
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You don't have to be a good person to be a good person.

305
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
There's some files, there are some things that you can switch on,

306
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
basically the files, some comments,

307
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and you have to change the streets,

308
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
what are the big relationships that you can set up with those files.

309
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So, I think one function of that is to be able to control it,

310
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
so that when you're in a social space,

311
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
you can be able to continue reading it,

312
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
change the streets, whatever.

313
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So, you push the stripper orders,

314
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
but then you've got to change the rules,

315
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
you've got to create a new way of doing things,

316
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and that's exactly what you need to do.

317
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So, the language code is really a little bit secretive,

318
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
because when you put the language code in the language,

319
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
it's just a little bit more simple.

320
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So, again, the concept of security files,

321
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
you know, streets, the signs, the footnotes,

322
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
the standards, the rules,

323
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
you know, the pretty big picture,

324
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
the human process, the human process.

325
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So, it's not only about the communities

326
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
that you're going to be able to do that,

327
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
so you're just going to have that stability

328
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
that remains in the same way that you do this.

329
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And that's basically what you're just going to do.

330
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So, it's very little bit complicated,

331
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
but it's not just about the communities,

332
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
it's the streets.

333
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So, it's not very complicated,

334
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
but it's really, really simple.

335
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And I think it's the most important thing,

336
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and I think this one is particularly important,

337
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
particularly when you're talking about the communities,

338
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
the people you're meeting with,

339
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
all these places.

340
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So, it's about the connection,

341
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
the needs, the company, the number of people,

342
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
it's going to be a little bit more complicated,

343
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
but it's really about the individual's lives,

344
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and the people,

345
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
the people you're meeting with,

346
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
sometimes, as individual groups.

347
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So, it's just a little bit of a different

348
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
kind of function, which allows you to have

349
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
a certain number of people in your space,

350
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and sometimes, sometimes you're just kind of

351
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
a family.

352
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So, in this case, it's a little bit different

353
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
than in the case of the community,

354
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
so it's really important

355
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
to have the people you're meeting with,

356
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and it's not because you're talking about

357
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the most popular included,

358
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,320
all the men that are in the

359
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,000
Plus 1 platform team.

360
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And every other experienced

361
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
one that has prepared an action,

362
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
work that has taken seven years to get ready,

363
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
so basically it's a combination of arenas,

364
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
the inte-시선s you see that

365
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
so that you have almost experienced

366
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
a net-to- 기대 never-before-seen

367
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
experience connected with a framework only found

368
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
in the worst countries

369
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
andotee English as a springboard for the organization.

370
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So, it's certainly an important component

371
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,320
of what this organization's performance

372
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,940
for

373
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,940
for youth sectors,

374
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,440
than probing extinction in robots,

375
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,220
stemming also from aandom encounters.

376
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,640
So, there is celebrations.

377
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,240
No, it's there now.

378
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,980
There's adventures.

379
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes, there is,

380
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,840
there's history now.

381
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,420
Endev wolf of the modern time.

382
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,440
Most especially people who are phenomena

383
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,340
have been sociologists.

384
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,940
They are corners for people often

385
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,000
who just worked heanti-benterists.

386
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,620
So it's just socialite Study disappears

387
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,920
these emerging forms ofppyochenschO.

388
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,080
So, to other forms of characters in order toia

389
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,780
that we find.

390
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,300
But essentially the computer skills

391
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,280
behind all these existing content

392
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,380
start truly and formally

393
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,440
thanks to ringspin writers.

394
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,460
We call that functions,

395
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,540
that's not literally what is needed,

396
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,240
we can use that to drill down.

397
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,760
All we think of for those who want to

398
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,420
read about this is

399
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,880
Rather, it's geven the public the opportunity

400
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:50,200
So we'd like to make sure that there are

401
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,640
concrete Oi's in op판

402
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,020
to 🤓

403
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,540
though.

404
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,240
We think there's some fights and the

405
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,400
whole of the fight is only in the

406
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,000
space you can't actually fight other

407
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,120
people.

408
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,780
Right. The

409
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,860
preheating is

410
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:37,860
of a theory, I can basically go back and melt protesters' wheels, whenever I can and I

411
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:48,860
can find anything at any time of the musical, or the violence underground in a state without

412
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,860
background.

413
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,860
So, we have to get them, that's where we have to go,

414
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,860
is through these social regions,

415
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,860
and to try to provide them with the necessary resources

416
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,860
so we can try to provide resources to the people

417
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,860
who are struggling with the medical services.

418
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,860
And so, that's the way it works, which is quite important.

419
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,860
So, we can try to get those companies,

420
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,860
the people who are struggling with the medical services,

421
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,860
to work with the medical services.

422
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,860
So, we've got, we've got the actual use,

423
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,860
we have the specialist companies,

424
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,860
who are just starting to build their classes,

425
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,860
and starting to fund these kind of companies.

426
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,860
So, we have general-purpose sites,

427
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,860
we have the contractors,

428
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,860
we just have the medical workers,

429
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,860
and we have the medical workers.

430
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,860
This factor, I think, is quite important,

431
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,860
in terms of, when we're considering the needs of these companies,

432
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,860
we want to reach the best teams,

433
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,860
which would work with the medical professionals,

434
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,860
and so on and so forth, just to,

435
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,860
you know, work with the medical professionals.

436
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,860
So, this is key for all of the investors,

437
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,860
to get them to work with all the companies,

438
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,860
to meet the needs, to get them to work with the medical professionals,

439
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,860
and to get them to work with the people

440
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,860
who are struggling with the medical services.

441
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,860
So, we're going to use that line,

442
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,860
and I'll give you a picture of the three points,

443
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,860
which are, of course, the basic,

444
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,860
the standard of the standard of the medical professionals,

445
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,860
and the standard of the medical professionals,

446
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,860
and three points, the spiritual,

447
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,860
because we're going to be considering the standard

448
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,860
of the medical professionals.

449
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,860
So, we're going to start there,

450
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,860
start that way, whatever,

451
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,860
to just create some kind of family,

452
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,860
family, family, family,

453
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,860
and just function as individuals.

454
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,860
So, this is just one of the problems,

455
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,860
and one of the problems,

456
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,860
and one of the most important issues,

457
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,860
and one of the most important problems,

458
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,860
is that we're just dessa suggestion

459
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,860
from doctors, from registered doctors

460
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,860
who are notkeys,

461
00:12:40,860 --> 00:13:02,860
so, sitting under awful headlich

462
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,580
I think that kind of institute is probably...

463
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,940
trance is the business opportunity.

464
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,240
So, we're making those tests in that window.

465
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,700
So, those are some examples.

466
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,860
We're committing to the study of these things

467
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,200
in some pipes, in which are the things It's going to take up situations

468
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,460
that are really quiteTM-like to strike.

469
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,620
They think of themselves as groups of entities.

470
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:51,280
And they are working together to build this

471
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,120
especially in terms of questioned judgements

472
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,880
To the rash does put the evidence in fact

473
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,480
in a very

474
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:13,480
And assuming США

475
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,360
This is the first of the three different things

476
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,280
that we've been working on recently.

477
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,120
I have to respect the issues that we have addressed.

478
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,720
Problems that we have addressed in the last few months.

479
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,000
And of course, the major problems

480
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,720
that we have addressed in the last four months

481
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,120
stand in the way of the current system.

482
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,960
And I think we need to address these issues.

483
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,840
And let's talk about the four things

484
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,400
that we need to address in the next few months.

485
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,080
So starting with two would be,

486
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,960
is there a fair cause for these issues?

487
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,280
So whether it's public or private,

488
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,960
the requests doesn't have to be there.

489
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,940
Public efforts are more easily noted

490
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,560
the more the more the request costs are.

491
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,160
The matters with respect to others

492
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,680
are more should be 환-re shedding

493
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,680
or being heard and gauge something somewhat ahtEMy.

494
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,080
I think our representatives have Abhinav

495
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,200
Abhinav, Shriver, Nijmog Bhattnaguru,

496
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:40,200
to the big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big and big

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
I'm sorry.

502
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
I'm sorry.

503
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
I'm sorry.

504
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
I'm sorry.

505
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
I'm sorry.

506
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
I'm sorry.

507
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
I'm sorry.

508
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
I'm sorry.

509
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
I'm sorry.

510
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
I'm sorry.

511
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
I'm sorry.

512
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
I'm sorry.

513
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
I'm sorry.

514
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,360
I'm sorry.

515
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
I'm sorry.

516
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
I'm sorry.

517
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
I'm sorry.

518
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
I'm sorry.

519
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
I'm sorry.

520
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
I'm sorry.

521
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
I'm sorry.

522
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
I'm sorry.

523
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
I'm sorry.

524
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
I'm sorry.

525
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
I'm sorry.

526
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,360
I'm sorry.

527
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,360
I'm sorry.

528
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
I'm sorry.

529
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
I'm sorry.

530
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
I'm sorry.

531
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
I'm sorry.

532
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,360
I'm sorry.

533
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,360
I'm sorry.

534
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,360
I'm sorry.

535
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,360
I'm sorry.

536
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
I'm sorry.

537
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
I'm sorry.

538
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,360
I'm sorry.

539
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
I'm sorry.

540
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
I'm sorry.

541
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
I'm sorry.

542
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
I'm sorry.

543
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
I'm sorry.

544
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
I'm sorry.

545
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
I'm sorry.

546
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:03,120
Again, except that I don't practice what I learn in

547
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,360
to look back and you could find that it is,

548
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,120
to give us experience through thisễ

549
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,100
effectively know mamma...

550
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,100
So what does it do, how to function,

551
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,680
changes, preserve,

552
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,840
everything that is a sacrifice,

553
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,820
which is actually being archived.

554
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,720
This is the place that he would engage himself.

555
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,200
That's the place to begin and continue on.

556
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,920
So, you are to go to walked along thexx

557
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,920
those simplify

558
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,340
in the new cultural service system.

559
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,560
So in the moment if you got the emotional

560
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,780
Twitter wallets

561
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,300
in the users со more than two to three channels

562
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,580
we need speed one

563
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,720
just one closing.

564
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,500
What we can dig in

565
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
is to other the other month.

566
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,020
But

567
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,940
we create speed

568
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,140
we canari

569
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:03,660
fixing aörnaut

570
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,820
and I, sent in behind there

571
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,980
resulting in an yıl

572
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,660
5 że praying so I

573
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,660
talk about prevent so

574
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,140
let's do the

575
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:33,140
So this is basically what is happening in the study,

576
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,140
the company and the industry, on the ground,

577
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,140
is changing the way this is processed.

578
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,140
And the first thing that we see is the overcrowding.

579
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,140
So this is the first thing that we see.

580
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,140
If you press 20 years, you might see the results

581
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,140
of 20 years in a row.

582
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,140
This is the process where the next year

583
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,140
is going to be the last year in the community.

584
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,140
So we are going to see the growth

585
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,140
of the new technology.

586
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,140
The next thing is the cost of the service.

587
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,140
The new technology is going to be

588
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,140
the cost of the new services that are going to be

589
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,140
put into practice to provide for every industry

590
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,140
in the country.

591
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,140
And we are just starting to see the growth.

592
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,140
Once the cost of the finance will be

593
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,140
at least?!?!

594
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,140
This thing is deciding to go out there.

595
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,140
Actually from the first elements,

596
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,140
removal of controls.

597
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,140
So what are the designs?

598
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,140
So sometimes these new impact systems

599
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,140
are only small when they first start.

600
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,140
So that makes it so that the business

601
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,140
is moving better.

602
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,140
What we are expecting as we are McConnell

603
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,140
is the new things.

604
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,640
I would say that the most important thing is to be able to

605
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,140
find the answers to the most difficult questions that you can

606
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,140
ask yourself.

607
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,140
It's really important.

608
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,140
It's the best way to do it.

609
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,140
It's the best way to do it.

610
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,140
And I think that's the most important thing.

611
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,140
It's the most important thing.

612
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,140
So, for that reason, I think that the most important thing is

613
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,140
to be able to find the answers.

614
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,140
One is that you have to cross over the boundaries of your

615
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,140
memories to the next point.

616
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,140
So, that's the most important thing.

617
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,400
So, work to find answers questions,

618
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,140
what are the answers?

619
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,440
I usually, in my work, in separately jargon,

620
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,940
find answers need to be start rookie stuff

621
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,580
with the deep key of the problems so they will

622
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,580
always start at the end of the session.

623
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,140
So, sometimesJI training go back to the very był Magnus

624
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:41,640
the government is very strong at his first presidential.

625
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:55,340
In this case the

626
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,540
It's something that is truly important for us to establish.

627
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,540
It's something that is special to us, something that is specific to us,

628
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,940
and that really is useful.

629
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,540
It's just one of the things that we're trying to do.

630
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,140
We're trying to construct a new system of policies.

631
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,540
So, for example, if you're in a job security system,

632
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,540
you're trying to build a new system.

633
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,340
It's something that is really useful and important.

634
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,540
It's important for us to have a record of issues

635
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,540
that are really important for us.

636
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,740
But it's important for us to have a record of issues

637
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,740
that are really useful.

638
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,140
It's important.

639
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,740
In other words,

640
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,340
I'm not saying that we're not going to build a new system of policies.

641
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,140
What we're going to do is we're going to build a system

642
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,340
that is truly useful.

643
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,540
It's going to be a system that is really useful.

644
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,740
We're going to build a system of policies.

645
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,740
After this, we're going to build a system

646
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,340
of policies that's responsive.

647
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,540
It's really useful.

648
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,240
It needs to be牂.

649
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,440
So, fortunately,

650
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,640
and that's the sacrifice we're wanting,

651
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,140
but it gets put into extreme Couple Motions

652
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,060
and it values again.

653
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,680
In other words, to99 and 1 have the突ドン

654
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,100
we've been watching for three years

655
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,100
this tremendous,πωςly needed to create a system

656
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,700
that is very useful that will make partnership wonderful.

657
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:32,340
Finally, we talked of combinatorial

658
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:40,700
intoxication with the substance

659
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:49,500
free OK certification exchanged

660
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,100
We should know we have to compounds,

661
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,520
no unknown food material.

662
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,680
So do we how much does it consume?

663
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:07,940
Should we learn about what can be

664
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,440
contained in food variables?

665
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,280
So important here to remember when to add

666
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,040
the biopsy.

667
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,380
4 eyes, ne webinar,

668
00:23:49,380 --> 00:24:06,500
a

669
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:13,800
3

670
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,040
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

671
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,040
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

672
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

673
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,040
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

674
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

675
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,040
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

676
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

677
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,040
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

678
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,040
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

679
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

680
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,040
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

681
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

682
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

683
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,040
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

684
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,300
My song is called

685
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,580
the

686
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,160
Behold Our Nations

687
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,040
Weстаточно of the

688
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,120
legs, back, and wings

689
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,480
it's as if it's a

690
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:08,020
quickly

691
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,140
Inevitably

692
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,640
We complacently

693
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,800
complete the

694
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
So, what do you think?

695
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:21,800
What are the things that you think are important to be done?

696
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,800
We have to be able to think about the things that are important to be done.

697
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
So, what do you think?

698
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,800
What are the things that are important to be done?

699
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Basically, guys, it's not gonna be just click.

700
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
It's gonna be click one at a time.

701
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
It's gonna be click two at a time.

702
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
I would say it's easy.

703
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
It's quite easy.

704
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,800
I think that's a great way to look at things.

705
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,800
And for most people, it's probably most of the things.

706
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,800
And in many cases, there are times when you're specifically playing those things,

707
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,800
and you're doing that specific thing that's really important to most people,

708
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,800
and most people's minds, and the most people's minds.

709
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
So, this is why I say that it's actually a lot of things,

710
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,800
because it's a lot of things that are very, very important,

711
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,800
and that are very important, either in terms of thinking,

712
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
or in terms of thinking,

713
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
is the problem, actually, with the economy.

714
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,800
We have a problem with the usability.

715
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,800
And it does have to do with the things that are supposed to be used.

716
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Here on the right, it's the things that are used.

717
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,800
The things that are used are the things that are used for the company.

718
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,800
The things that are used for the companies are the things that are used for the companies.

719
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,800
So, I think that's a good way to think about it.

720
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:34,800
I think that the systems are not so much for the businesses that are used for the companies.

721
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Ethics that are used spread well.

722
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:41,080
There's new topics that need jumping on top of

723
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,800
so many im Video teams that they're making this up

724
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
So they ramen down those levels.

725
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,920
But we can see the fall of a mould of things,

726
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,800
and it's the vision of these productions and to build them up.

727
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
It's important things I think to think about.

728
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:01,800
This is a question that has been that has made more interesting,

729
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,120
at Harvard Press now where they campaign for higher education,

730
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,120
OOMN in this virtual university instant meetings,

731
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,560
as a means of discussion on Yayon Ya crappy

732
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,120
university-based powdered water.

733
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:29,600
Yeah, Otamal, one of the next best- ws
