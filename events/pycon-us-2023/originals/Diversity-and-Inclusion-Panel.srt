1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
All right. Thank you so much. Thank you, the steering council, for your service. Thank you

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:15,040
so much for your service to the Python community. Next, we also have the next special guest we have

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,720
is our diversity and inclusion panel who are making their way to the stage right now.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,400
As you know, the diversity and inclusion is something that we put high priority in

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,600
in the Python community. I'm so glad to have the panel here today. Welcome.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:40,000
Hi, everyone. My name is Marlene and I'm the chair of the PSAF diversity and inclusion work group.

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,520
For anyone who isn't aware, Python is a very popular programming language and it's being

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,920
used on every single continent in the world. So if there's a continent out there, there is someone

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:02,080
programming in Python there. So one of the reasons that we have the TSAF DNI work group is to

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,480
try to represent and advocate for the needs of Python programmers in these different regions

11
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:16,000
of the world. And one of the ways that we do this is that the work group has representative

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,080
members from every single continent in the world with the exception of Antarctica. So if you are

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,560
here from Antarctica or if you know someone from Antarctica, please reach out to me or come and

14
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,920
speak to me right after. We would love to have you join our group. And, yeah, we just try our best

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,560
to have discussions about what Python programmers in these different regions need and what their

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:50,320
challenges are. And then we also try to support the PSAF board and the PSAF itself.

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,120
In their mission. And the mission of the PSAF is actually to promote and protect the Python

18
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:02,160
programming language and to advance the growth of a diverse and international group of Python

19
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,240
programmers. So so far, the PSAF has been really successful in doing that. We've really seen a lot

20
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,240
of growth over the years. And so in this sort of panel session, we're going to have a discussion

21
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,320
about some of the core issues that we think are important for the community around the world to be

22
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:25,760
aware of. And also sharing as well some of the challenges in other parts of the world in terms

23
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,760
of things that Python programmers have been going through. So I'm going to let everyone here is part

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,240
of the work group and I'm going to let them introduce themselves. Please could you tell us

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:44,160
your name, also where you came from and how long it took you to get here. And then we'll have a

26
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,120
Q&A session with you. It took me 28 hours to get here. So I don't know if you can start.

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:59,520
Hi, everyone. My name is Deborah. And I flew all the way from Brazil. And it took me around 30

28
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:09,040
hours to get here from where I live. Great. Yeah. I think that deserves a round of applause. I think

29
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,680
that's amazing. Hello, everyone. Good morning. My name is Sikbal. I'm flying in from Tokyo. This

30
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,960
is my second PyCon US. I took some notes down. It took me two airport transit, two airport transits,

31
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,720
two meals, one short nap, one immigration clearance, which took a total of 11 hours,

32
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,400
20 minutes to get to PyCon. But obviously before the physical presence of PyCon, it took me

33
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,320
since 2003 to learn Python to get here. Nice to meet you all.

34
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,760
Hi. My name is Georgie. I should have actually mentioned my previous country where I live in.

35
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,080
So it sounds more magnificent, the number of hours. So I was previously living in Thailand and now I'm

36
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:08,160
in Amsterdam. And it took me about 10 hours to fly here straight. I feel so bad.

37
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:23,040
Great. Lucky. So now that we talk about the, oh, what happened to the location page?

38
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:33,600
That's right. You can skip it. Okay. So now, Deborah, let's talk about you as

39
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:42,720
one of the members of board of directors. Let's skip the formal part, like how it ended up,

40
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,440
you ended up getting a seat and become a director. Yes, of course. So I've been

41
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,400
an active member in the Python community in Brazil for quite some time now. Almost

42
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,600
10 years. Oh, my God. It's been quite some time. So yeah, I've been very active in the community.

43
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,080
I'm one of the co-founders of Pylates Brazil, which is the largest Pylates chapter in the world.

44
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,880
It's like a network of chapters that we have all around Brazil. And yeah, so since the beginning

45
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:24,160
of Pylates in Brazil, I was very involved with everything. And I remember in 2016, Naomi Cedar

46
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,080
was a keynote speaker at Python Brazil, which is our national gathering. And she mentioned about

47
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,760
the PSF. And I really didn't know that there was this whole thing, like in the backstage doing

48
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:44,640
PyCon and protecting Python itself. So I was like, okay, this is really nice. And then I started to

49
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,760
spread the word. And I got to know that there is a board of directors, a group of volunteers that

50
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,440
are elected. Every year there are different seats, but every year there is an election.

51
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,520
And I got to know many people from different countries from the Python community. And I was

52
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,480
encouraged by my peers, my Pylate friends to run for the board. And then I decided, you know, I

53
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:15,200
kind of had something to contribute to it. So I decided to run. And then I didn't get in for the

54
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:25,360
first time. And like for a handful of votes. And I remember that I didn't make the cut. And before

55
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,040
me, there was a Mexican woman, Valerie, that didn't make it for like five votes or something like that.

56
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,720
And, you know, when we looked at the board at the time, I didn't literally see anyone that looked

57
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:46,480
like me. You know what I mean? So like being represented on the board. And then I decided that

58
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,680
I would try again. I would try one more time. Because I thought that many other people would

59
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,560
benefit to having, you know, something that looked like them and could bring, you know, the PSF and

60
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,440
everything that's been happening to their local communities. So yeah, I decided to run again. And

61
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,160
the time I made it. So right now I'm part of the board of directors. Which is really cool to be

62
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:19,200
there and to understand many things that are behind PyCon and Python itself. We have to make

63
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:27,840
many decisions. We're kind of a strategic, you know, board to help the PSF to promote its mission.

64
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:36,640
And it's been a hack of a journey. I'm learning so much. And I'm really glad to be here with you all

65
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:44,560
in that. Yeah. Awesome. Thanks, Tiff. So as you can see, the graph on the screen there shows just

66
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,720
how diverse the board has become over the years. So obviously over 20 years initially, the board

67
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,280
started very North American and European. And over time, it's gotten more colorful. And that's

68
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,040
something that is, you know, a testament to the work that PSF, the board of directors themselves

69
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,880
and the community has done as well. Just in terms of listening to voices from around the world. So

70
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:15,840
it's really fantastic. So the next question is for Georgie. Georgie, are there other ways that

71
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,200
people can participate if they don't want to run for the board of directors? How can they be involved

72
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:28,720
in the Python community? Well, now let me press the button. There you go. Okay. So the Python

73
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,360
community is a lot more than just core developers. It's similar to what Marietta has mentioned about

74
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:43,360
like this event where there's lots of different people behind the scene. So our common passion

75
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,120
does not limit us to just code. You can also contribute what you're good at or simply what

76
00:08:49,200 --> 00:09:00,640
you like to do. So you can take a look at this little picture. Yeah. So if you're really good in

77
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,760
writing, you're in have a flair in writing and all this, then you can actually contribute to

78
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:12,320
the documentation. I tried it once. I'm not very good at it. So I'll try again next time. But I did

79
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:23,520
manage to pass, get through one. In a C Python, yes. Then also if you are actually, you have a

80
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:30,080
teaching background, for example, like Deborah here, you can also help by providing some tutorials

81
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,360
or workshops which will be really, really, really useful for those beginners anywhere around the

82
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,600
world. It doesn't need to be in the U.S. So any parts of the world, the Python community is huge

83
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:52,480
and very, very large. Or if you're just like me who likes designing and drawing pictures and stuff

84
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,520
like that and you can help out in the design side to do the logos, the banners, or even the website.

85
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,680
And also things like if you're really, really good in getting things together and like

86
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,200
organizing friends, birthday parties and stuff like that, think about doing the organizing team.

87
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,000
That would be great for that skill that you have. So at the PSF, we not only have the steering

88
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,200
council, we also have, and the board of directors, but we also have other work groups. So you can see

89
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,240
here in the list we have the code of conduct, the grants, the infrastructure, even a Python job

90
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,520
board, the marketing, packaging, scientific, trademarks, and us, the diversity and inclusion

91
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:50,400
work group. So there's always, always ways you can contribute. Yeah, yeah, awesome. So

92
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,600
definitely if you would like to get involved, please reach out. There's also the PSF booth

93
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,560
that is there in the exhibition hall. And so if you would want to join one of the work groups,

94
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,920
please feel free to ask. And then finally, we're going to just discuss a little bit. Iqbal is from

95
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Asia, and I would love, we would love to know some of the issues that you think come up. What

96
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,840
does diversity and inclusion mean for you in the region? And what has the Python community looked

97
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:28,160
like in Asia? Thank you, Malin. That's a great question, actually. And before I start off,

98
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,840
explain to you folks what is diversity and inclusion within the region that I'm in,

99
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:41,360
which is Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia specifically. One disclaimer, I do not speak

100
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,960
for the community members which are with me today. They can speak for themselves. We are a diverse

101
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:53,120
group of many countries and many communities. But I do believe that since 2010, I've been working

102
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,720
with them and they do understand where I'm coming from and where I think we should head.

103
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,920
So please take that as a disclaimer. So I'm not speaking for anyone. This is my personal opinion.

104
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:14,480
Southeast Asia, East Asia is one, or if I may say, the most diverse region on the planet. We have

105
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,240
over 1,200 spoken languages, including dialects, and 300 ethnicities in terms of

106
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,200
people. You have all these cultures, all these languages. None of them consider English as their

107
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,760
native language. In terms of skin color, you can get from white to black in a very short span of

108
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,000
geography. Or even in a single country. In a single country, exactly. So it's very diverse.

109
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,240
And diverse is default. As a parameter, it's default. So when a new community member comes

110
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,360
to join the regional Asia Pacific or Asia group that we have, by default, they are different

111
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,960
than us. They do not look like myself. They do not look like the person next to me. They do not

112
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,520
speak the same language. They do not have the same values. So now, ironically, when we talk about

113
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,960
diversity and inclusion, what is important is how do we actually get them together to head into a

114
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:16,400
single direction and believe into a single cause so that we can work together. And that's where

115
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,880
the inclusion comes in. And this is important. So from my point of view, personally, after working

116
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,120
with all of my peers, there's two things that we try to drill down. And I hope perhaps maybe

117
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,880
you can go back home after the conference and look within your own communities if there's some

118
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:37,200
parallels that you can learn from us. So these two values, they are inclusion and they are also

119
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,000
the shared values. What kind of shared values that we want to pass on and share. Inclusion is

120
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:53,120
important to us because you need to be not represented. You need to be accounted for and

121
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,400
you need to be heard and you are present. So we try to get as many people involved,

122
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,040
mostly from different social classes that we have, people who's working in the city, working in

123
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,520
rural areas, and take advantage of, and this is a very important point, of the opportunities

124
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:19,840
that we can pass on and spread out across our community. After all, we are only the best of us

125
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:27,040
if we are with the rest of us. I think this is actually one of the main reasons why we started

126
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:35,520
this diversity and inclusion work group because we feel that the Python community is a lot more

127
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:41,840
than just Europe and U.S. And we can see here today that there's so many people around here,

128
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,440
especially this year celebrating the 20 years anniversary. We saw a lot of people from Ghana,

129
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:55,600
we saw people from Japan, Hong Kong, everywhere. And of course, South America too, there was like

130
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:04,240
amazing amount of people. And just a very simple result here is that all four of us

131
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:12,400
have actually tried the board of directors. And the first time when I just started, I have no idea

132
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,520
what it was because I don't even know what membership means. It's like there's three different

133
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:24,960
types. So you can actually check on the website and to see the three different types of...

134
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,480
Is that three or four? Yeah, there are different types of memberships. You have a basic membership

135
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,040
which is free of charge. You just need to agree to the PSF code of conduct and you become a basic

136
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,080
member. However, if you want to vote in our bylaws and also for the board of director elections,

137
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,880
which you should, there are other possibilities. So you can either be a supporting member

138
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:57,040
making an yearly donation of $9.89, but now we have a sliding scale that starts at $25.

139
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,000
You can choose, but then you have the same voting rights. You can also be a managing member

140
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:12,880
or a contributing member if you help to promote the PSF vision through writing code, contributing

141
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:20,000
to open source, organizing local, regional, national events, running tutorials, sprints. If you do that

142
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,400
at least five hours a month, you can self-register yourself as a voting member.

143
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,360
And yeah, you can vote for our bylaws. I think this is the part that a lot of them

144
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,880
don't know that they are already qualified. Yeah, exactly. We are not including them in there. We

145
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,680
need to actively remind them. And then I think the first time when I mentioned this to a lot of

146
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,720
the communities, and they were like, I've been helping out for like more than 10 years,

147
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:58,960
but they are not a member. So we are not some kind of clan to like ask you to just join and

148
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:06,320
no, nothing scary, but we just need to have your voice coming together. And we want to hear how

149
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:14,560
Python actually contributes to your part of the world. And we need that to understand how we can

150
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:22,640
actually work this ecosystem together. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, we would love for you all

151
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:30,400
to get involved more. The elections this year for the PSF board are usually around June. We'd love

152
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,920
for you when you are voting to not just think of the popular names that you know from North America

153
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:44,400
or Europe. If you see a name from Japan or Africa, please feel free to like read the statement and

154
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:51,360
and consider voting for them as well. So if you do have any questions about the PSF, what the PSF

155
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,280
does, what the DNI work group does as well, please feel free to chat to any of us or go to the PSF

156
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,680
booth. Like we said, that's in the extra hall. Thanks so much for listening to our session.

157
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,720
And yeah, have a great Python. Thank you. Thanks, everyone.

158
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:17,520
Thank you so much, the diversity inclusion panel. I am a little bit early, so I'm gonna go off script,

159
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:25,040
off schedule. I wanna clarify. Actually, when I set up my challenge, one of them is about

160
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:32,400
one of the one point you can earn that you become a new PSF member. And I'm so glad that you mentioned

161
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:39,040
that. I set up those challenge not for me, it's really for you to become part of the Python

162
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:46,080
community. Anyone can sign up to become a PSF member. Go to the website. I think there's a link

163
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:53,520
that shared earlier. I will clarify how to get the five points of becoming a voting member of the PSF.

164
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:06,080
So, how I know all of this in my head? The first way, if you are a contributing member, say if you

165
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:14,560
run local meetups, or you are an open source maintainer, basically the requirement is you spend

166
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:23,360
five hours a week to grow the Python community, either by hosting meetups, hosting conferences,

167
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,600
maintaining contributing to open source projects. You can become self-certify yourself. Nobody will

168
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:38,800
ask you for a time lock. You just certify that, yes, I run a local meetup. I contribute to open

169
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:45,840
source. The next thing that the next way to become a voting member is by

170
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:56,960
if you are a PSF fellow, basically if you see someone in your community who are doing a great

171
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:06,080
job, nominate them for the PSF fellow, someone who you trust, who have helped you, nominate them.

172
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:14,480
And usually they are, you can self-nominate, but people don't do that. You can help them

173
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:22,000
get that recognition. Nominate people you know to become PSF fellow member and the Python community

174
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,200
service award recipient. You can nominate people. It's not that something we or the PSF manually

175
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:38,320
select people. All of this comes from your input, your nomination. The third way to become a voting

176
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:45,920
member is by making donation, becoming a supporting member of a PSF. If you make an annual donation,

177
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:54,480
it used to be you need to be donating at least $99, US dollars a year. We recognize that for

178
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:02,080
people outside of North America that is not an affordable amount. There is a sliding scale and

179
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:12,080
you can read more details about it on the PSF website. With that, before going to the next

180
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,920
session, I also want to thank again our visionary sponsors. We actually have

181
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,560
Bloomberg who is one of our visionary sponsors who want to share a few messages.

182
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,560
Good morning, everyone. My name is Olga Matula and I'm an engineer at Bloomberg

183
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:46,880
and the co-chair of our internal Python guild. On behalf of Bloomberg, I'd like to extend a

184
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,600
warm welcome to everyone here at PyCon US today. We are very excited to be part of this incredible

185
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,360
event for another year among such a diverse and dedicated group of Python enthusiasts.

186
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:07,840
We come to PyCon US because our over 8,000 engineers and many of our data analysts

187
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,800
use Python daily to deliver news and financial information to our clients, to build our systems

188
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:22,240
and our infrastructure and to do financial analysis. Bloomberg is committed to supporting

189
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,080
the development of open source technology. As heavy consumers of Python and its ecosystems,

190
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,360
we want to show our support in multiple ways. We are a visionary sponsor of the PSF and we have

191
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:44,240
been sponsoring PyCon US since 2015. Our people are C-Python core developers. They have authored PEPs

192
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,720
and delivered multiple talks all over the world. They maintain and contribute to open source

193
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,040
projects and have developed open source tools like memory and PyStack, our most recent announcement.

194
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,120
You might have heard some of that during our talk on Thursday morning.

195
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,520
As a further step to demonstrate our commitment to open source technology and Python,

196
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:19,360
we have made a recent announcement. We will be sponsoring the PSF's hiring of another C-Python

197
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:31,120
core development in residence for a year. That deserves a clap. We've done something similar in

198
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:38,400
the past when we offered funding for two years for a person to be a project, a community maintainer

199
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,640
for the Python packaging ecosystem. This is a terrific opportunity. We are very happy to

200
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,320
be providing this to an experienced developer to work on the C-Python core for a full time for a

201
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:58,800
year. You will be, I think the PSF will be making a formal announcement this week. So, yeah, watch

202
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:06,240
over that. We have our booth in the tech expo hall and we will have engineers who will be happy to

203
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,480
chat to you about how we use Python at Bloomberg, our open source involvement and, of course, our

204
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:22,080
open positions. So, please do feel to drop on by. Thank you and have a great show.
