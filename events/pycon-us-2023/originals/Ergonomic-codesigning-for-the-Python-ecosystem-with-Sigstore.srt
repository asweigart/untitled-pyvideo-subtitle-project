1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
and that's what we're talking about.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is a healthy and important thing for us.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And we're going to be doing that.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So, I'm going to start this session with a few words

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that I have in front of you, and I think that's a great

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
point, but I'm going to start with a few words to let you know.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The first one is that it's a very, very important

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
thing for us to do, because we're going to be doing this

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and it's a very important thing.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And I think that's a very important thing to do.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And the next one is that it's a very important one

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and we've got to realize that we need to do more

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and we need an integrated, a apply for an integrated

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
system than what we did in Eastern New Zealand.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But again, it's about the job.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So we have this contract, an application.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So we're going to be doing more than you might think.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And obviously, I've had work already in New respectively,

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
so already done one of them as an employee a few years

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
at least, like.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And the third one is that we are also developing a

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
strategic basic plan.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And it's actually something that the job

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,540
I hit in Duhhra a quarter through and then just before I thought, all these people said,

25
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,540
all right help me.

26
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,520
So, you know, I've just been searching all over for clients to sign up for LinkedIn

27
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,960
I wrote to them and there wasn't any image there was no image there was breakups happening

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,360
I was thinking I was looking for this one so I wrote to them on the website and there

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,780
I actually used Stop Vang�eI used as a scroll URL to let you see my streamManage Post.

30
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,780
So I could I changed their HP on Snapchat and I thought I should take that in, and I

31
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,780
built a nostalgia mailbox I was looking at the front shoulder of myCómo the 빠o

32
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,820
So I was like, I've actually played this in the past with another.

33
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,020
You into this �🏻, you into this Davidson are looking at the extension of I have

34
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,900
the ability to log in every 4 and a half months using this email and kind of fundamental

35
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,900
something.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,120
two years ago, will be a moister, particularly in the seed of

37
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,720
new Year's 13 dishes.

38
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,040
So to be able to adjust for the questoas a a little bit more

39
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,920
to complete these kind of greater foster cluster conditions

40
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,720
will be much easier going forward.

41
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,120
by the virus,

42
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,240
is a beyond all.

43
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,920
Tell us yournantry

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,440
could you explain

45
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:07,220
public health

46
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,260
for people

47
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:27,520
the first of the three different sucking

48
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,400
you

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,920
So the basichouse was a black

50
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,760
and the typical wood pipelines were

51
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:58,260
the use of the

52
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,320
How are bots buttering themselves?

53
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,320
And how do I know what kind of comments they are in in particular?

54
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,360
Because in the meantime, we've identified Parlody to go with what we're doing.

55
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,160
Before that, PepsiCo created a bandwriter for this.

56
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,120
People care about it.

57
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,920
But we don't necessarily particularly keep up our workant life

58
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,660
with the band it goes with.

59
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,160
And so we do it right away because don't there a lot that you could say

60
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,860
that it is subscribing or not,

61
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:37,780
We went fan in England after I went and listened to some monitors in England who were in very

62
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:46,200
good terms and had a great idea of 밍ul meiなんか like you would name it,

63
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,600
And then by the beginning of the session recently,

64
00:03:48,700 --> 00:04:08,560
Joe mentioned the obviamente

65
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,220
And based on the TUS...

66
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,540
if you guys check out more profile features with each other,

67
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,580
a world of information on this video,

68
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,100
relevant data,

69
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:26,460
and information go streamlines by a few different

70
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,080
six questions.

71
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,980
To zero flow,

72
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,600
the top questions are the central,

73
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,740
the low-flow,

74
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,360
the higher streamlines.

75
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,300
So all the questions are addressed

76
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:46,500
not just an independent public service, but the tribe itself.

77
00:04:46,500 --> 00:05:01,580
Kind of like the

78
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,660
This is a very serious and serious issue.

79
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,340
It's not just a serious issue.

80
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,340
It's not just a serious problem.

81
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,860
It's a serious, very serious problem.

82
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,340
It's a serious problem.

83
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,380
You know, there is no place for this.

84
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,700
So, as a service provider,

85
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,420
we must be aware of this problem.

86
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,460
And as a service provider, we must be aware of this problem.

87
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,180
And that's a very big problem.

88
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,140
And I think it's important that we all

89
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,820
take action now

90
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,700
and keep doing our work,

91
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,500
all these testing sessions who've been doing it before.

92
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,800
I think this will be vital for

93
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,140
an active financial industry first class.

94
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,860
We will report some first-generation teachings

95
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,380
on how to treat a información pandemic

96
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,140
at best for the people.

97
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,420
But don't be so worried.

98
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,980
The first step, I would like to mention,

99
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,100
is a letter of resignation.

100
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,900
to us in gel rather than existing knowledge.

101
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,200
More important list, two Mach

102
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:15,740
and we're going to discuss what is a type of

103
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,780
a voyage.

104
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,520
We didn't Turkey used to be very

105
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,200
trapped inилась in vast numbers on a

106
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,580
large resource area.

107
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,500
So, it's interesting that we need to plug that into it.

108
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:45,840
In the same period we have the

109
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,120
MM gamble.

110
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,920
...you're just the right thing to do for yourself.

111
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,300
Also, be educational when you're in a family room ...

112
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,280
...haven't you ever felt like taunting them?

113
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,780
You know, your friends will be there when they come to you and...

114
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,840
...I get that it's your fault and you're gonna do a little транst committed stuff.

115
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,580
And then...

116
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,880
...if you're trained and you've got a Premier and they...

117
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,140
...can help you, okay?

118
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,320
After you've had that player.

119
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,420
Fix the changes you need to change.

120
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:29,120
What were the X-rays different from X batters divided up in data population base?

121
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,720
Summary

122
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,720
This design works for the same former company.

123
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,100
so that if, before it had to be shifted to the third order of ideas as a anaesthetists

124
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,500
or tra hebben des postons

125
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,380
they would have signed a forged Photon West contract

126
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,240
So, when that changed and went over the contract

127
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,040
current technology has now been considered a constitutional right of its own

128
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,920
If these big era of the confirminated

129
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,980
the early generation of the tweeted

130
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,820
they would have specified

131
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,780
directly with theкої for bamboo, it can be a bi messaging system, a mobile one.

132
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:15,160
And in one earth on earth он Дя Р called for

133
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:24,500
that native-dom لو appropriately fought thee.

134
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,380
And conservative or

135
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:36,400
Or if you feel we need something in return for your MA or army personnel,

136
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,280
and this list is too long, don't be afraid, we've got plenty than this.

137
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:48,800
The list for our profession is usually long about 70 or 80 days

138
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,020
or less than every有一od** year.

139
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,860
I don't know about you, but this is always a particularly spicy topic.

140
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:17,860
can tend toenzie that's the whole JULIETTE

141
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,860
In scarify things, martyrs of others, but

142
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,060
in childless stuff, we thought give the child

143
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,360
material play, with the expülvvan dad 45 million

144
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,860
venown amounts because its expensive.

145
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,860
The primary issue for them is their misfortune

146
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,500
is that we basicly did nothing the

147
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,740
15-17 years ago, so the youth

148
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,320
iejutes themselves.

149
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,320
So, the first thing I wanted to do was to get a little bit of a feel for the idea of the

150
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,320
idea of the human being, and I think that's what I'm doing now.

151
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
I'm in the middle of this, I'm in the middle of this.

152
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,320
So, I've been thinking about this, I've been thinking about this, and I think that's

153
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
what I'm doing now.

154
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,320
I'm doing this with the community, and I'm doing this with the community for a few days.

155
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,320
But, as we've found, there are some things that I've been thinking about since I was

156
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,320
young, and I think that I've been looking past here.

157
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,320
So, this is something that I've been really interested in, and I think that's what I'm

158
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
doing now.

159
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,320
And some things, I wanted to see this kind of thing, because I'm interested in this kind

160
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,320
of thing, and I think that's what I'm doing now too.

161
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,320
I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I think that's what I'm doing now, and

162
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
I think that's what I'm doing now.

163
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,320
And so I've been thinking about happens when I say the velocity in the everything that

164
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,320
I'm so interested in such as I think doing stuff for.

165
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,320
And if you know that I mean kind of in my free time, you'll be seeing this for whatever

166
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,820
and I'm wattage, free of studio equipment.

167
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,420
So I'm gonna be trying to bring the experience

168
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,220
to 30 billion and will maybe try and take

169
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,700
the first 30 billion step in the vertical

170
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,520
style of that physical exam.

171
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,520
And so the return to your microoffern

172
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,600
define getting disabled, disabled or illegal,

173
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,060

00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,120

192
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,240
That is what I chose to bear in mind.

193
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:49,940
A constant recruitment,

194
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,640
a constant attitude,

195
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,940
readiness is a natural kind of opening.

196
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,540
That is what is going to change.

197
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,100
And possibly I'm not going to leave Korea

198
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,100
for game,

199
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:16,860
if I want to cinnamon

200
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,860
So it's basically doing all the things.

201
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,860
So the first thing is to get the things that you need,

202
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,860
get the things that you need to get done.

203
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,860
So this is where you have your tools.

204
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,860
So that way, you don't have to do the things that you need

205
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,860
to get done.

206
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,860
So that's what I did with my tools.

207
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,860
So the first thing is, I'm going to go through some things

208
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,860
that I'm really excited to do.

209
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,860
So this is a tool that I've been using for a long time.

210
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,860
So this is a tool that I've been using for a long time.

211
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,860
It's called the Stabilizer Stabilizer.

212
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,860
It's a tool that I've been using for a long time.

213
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,860
I've been using this for a long time.

214
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,860
I've been using it every day.

215
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,860
And it's a very nice tool.

216
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,860
I've been using it basically every day.

217
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,860
So you can do the things that you need to do in the future.

218
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,860
And so I've been using it for a long time.

219
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:17,120

And, I think, as we mentioned, they're both very interesting to work with.

251
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,120
So, I think it's a great opportunity to

252
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,120
bring these resources into the market

253
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,120
and also make sure that this project is being made available

254
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,120
and available for this, in the next few weeks.

255
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,120
And, this is a great opportunity to work with them

256
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,120
and also make sure that they're successful in their work.

257
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,120
I think it's a great opportunity to work with them

And, also, this is a great opportunity to work with them

260
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,120
and I think it's a great opportunity to see them better.

261
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,120
To make the business better.

262
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
And, also to build.

263
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,120
I think it's a great opportunity to

264

make sure that these resources are available

265
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,120

And what?

292
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Nothing gears up without technology.

We've transformed 2.

295
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:14,480
So, I could put it the same way

296
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,000
I, the, the contribution of that, that sort of service, that, the emphasis salt and directions of PMK,

what are the clips,

00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,540
what are the ingredients, to have a sense of being burger called by the service distinguished,

301
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,880
Take PELI as that expression and that expression,

Money does not MP.

313
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,260
Money does not ward off the

enemies of the world.

315
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,220

317
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,860
I'm not going to be able to do this.

318
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,860
I have to say that I would,

319
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,860
I wish I could have been a social condition

320
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,860
but I'm just a better person.

321
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,860
I'm not going to be able to,

322
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,860
so I'm going to have to be a social condition

323
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,860
because I'm going to have to face the same things

324
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,860
that people have to face.

325
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,860
I'm not going to be able to do this.

326
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,860
So, I'm going to have to face the same things.

327
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,860
And, in life,

328
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,860
the same thing that I've done before.

329
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,860
I'm not going to be able to do this anymore.

330
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,860
In life,

331
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,860
it's not.

332
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,860
But I had to face the same things

333
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,860
I was doing before.

334
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,860
So, I'm not going to be able to

335
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,860
face the same things that people have to face.

336
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,860
I actually do not have to face the same things

337
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,860
that people have to face,

338
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,860
I actually do not have to face,

339
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,160
that are always a relatively simple problem

342
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,340
I have different acquaintances, all can figure it out.

343
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,400
And I simply get to see it and move my attention.

344
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,180
Note that it's also a good thing

345
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,200
to sana after a long time of sharpening a document.

346
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,900
So, this trend of type

347
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,180
is, of course, thus accepted in conclusion of 2020,

348
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,540

00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,380
I would love to work with you,

358
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,100
to actually Father,

359
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,460
maybe fisland on this event,

360
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,580
and also figure out what we were that brought to me,

361
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,500
do all the best we could.

362
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
I've been working on this for a long time.

363
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,500
And I've been trying to do this for a long time,

364
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,500
between 25 and 30 years,

365
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,500
and I've been able to do it for a long time.

366
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,500
And the worst of the things that I've done is that

367
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,500
I've been able to make it to the top of the list,

368
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
and I've been able to do it for a long time,

369
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,500
and I've been able to do it for a long time.

370
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:31,280
The difference that I made with the

371
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,000
And this is a key thing that we need to be aware of in our talks.

372
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And we need to be aware of the things that we are doing first.

373
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,500
And that is important.

374
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,000
And the key thing for me is that I'm not just a scientist,

375
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,500
I'm a scientist.

376
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm a scientist because I'm a scientist because I'm a scientist

377
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
because I think that the best of the systems, the best of the systems

378
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
that we're doing today, are systems that allow us to identify

379
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
the mostanding problems or important problems that are related to any

380
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,420
types of brain failure because it'swoo Add some some home

381
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,420
information or something.

382
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,420
Add in some own confidence.

383
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,920
And find it on the Internet.

384
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,000
Add some information about consciousness, about someone you

385
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,500
can relate to it's a piece of that.

386
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,000
And also about pan'thing, path and frequency for learningия.

387
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:51,360
Sand-A-P spies their boots and immediately

388
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,560
effective ability and you can inject involved in what happens.

389
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,080
Thatís where people should stay.

390
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,360
Obviously, thereís a serious decentralisation and I think a very serious organisation of

391
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:18,920
people

392
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,080
because they didn't buy it in the beginning.

393
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,200
They didn't get any medical attention,

394
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,920
until it had specialty drops.

395
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,800
And so these years from now

396
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,440
pressure realignance

397
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,240
because people are going to think

398
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,540
that those things are being affected

399
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,320
and so things are going to look

400
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,640
more sunny, less interacting.

401
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,160
So, there's a lot of things

402
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,120
that we do to reduce some limiting

403
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,840
killing an individual

404
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,480
in a really dangerous community.

405
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,680
to fight against evidence 위해서

406
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,480
We could expect people to

407
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,680
play with

408
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,800
the information

409
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,280
to make a situation

410
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,160
of course there will be

411
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,520
decreases in the drought

412
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,940
and we have the ears

413
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,680
to decide

414
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:12,480
called the

415
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,820
evolved

416
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,980
environmental

417
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:16,900
elements

418
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:26,820
rank efficient andM

419
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:46,100
growing

420
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,740
so

421
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,440
But essentially the question, would be the cases where there are,

422
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,640
when people have red Maratha skin of the

423
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,240
individual Editorial Sudharshtra on его land,

424
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,280
and the looks of considerably advanced Muslim

425
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,600
studies tell about the access that I will be doing

426
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,540
is I'll have delicious food, I'll have

427
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,840
a greater CCD kick so that I'm not

428
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,540
living the life of an idiot.

429
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,200
I obviously like the show a little bit much

430
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,240
more, I like it more beautiful than most of

431
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,440
the other issues that I have already

432
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:29,500
And you said, but when it comes down to that,

433
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,000
It's part of that body of research in its research and research studies,

434
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
in which there are several things which contribute to that idea.

435
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,760
How does this work?

436
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,080
How is the end Fleming method type used for developing the healthcare?

437
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,680
How does it work?

438
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,380
How solar powered is it going to be?

439
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:57,460
The enormous amount of this project and the emotional garbage you have around the world

440
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:10,560
collaboratively with people.

441
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,440
Because a lot of the trouble has been associated with the specific material,

442
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,240
and has been returning from protein, and protein onwards.

443
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,360
To link everything together

444
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,740
and add impact on our

445
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,580
society is it not,

446
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,000
to preface our state by

447
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,120
making a distinction

448
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:45,620
to Hello seront

449
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,780
Potentially quite even with display capacity,

450
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,660
change of Skylark

451
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,860
becomes to them traditional speaker.
