00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Thank you so much, Deb, and congratulations to all the award recipients.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:14,800
For this next section, it's our final special guest who probably needs no introduction.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,960
It's Guido van Rassen, the creator of Python, and who will be speaking about his retrospective

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,640
of Python, basically.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,760
So please welcome on stage Guido.

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
I need a dongle.

7
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,240
Let me play with a mic to see if this works.

8
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:20,980
OK.

9
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,120
Oh my gosh, they gave me way more time than I needed.

10
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,120
That's OK.

11
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
Slideshow.

12
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Yeah, I do this every day, as you see.

13
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
OK, I think.

14
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
Ha.

15
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
Sorry, folks.

16
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
Hello.

17
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,120
So there's been a slight change of topic.

18
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:04,320
At the very last moment, I decided that I'd much rather talk about what everybody would

19
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:12,640
much rather talk about, feeding CPython to chat GPT or large language models in general.

20
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,120
Can we actually use AI to make Python faster?

21
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Actually, that might have been a cool talk, but I have nothing on that.

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
I'm just trying to give Mariada a heart attack.

23
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
Really sorry, Mariada.

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,120
Or maybe really sorry to everyone who believed that for a moment.

25
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,120
This is a PyCon retrospective, not a Python retrospective that would take weeks.

26
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,120
Actually, the way I'm envisioning this is a talk in the style of,

27
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,120
Grandpa, please tell us some stories from when you were young.

28
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,120
I'm a lot older than Carol Welling, and you could have figured out how old she is.

29
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Usually, when confronted with a question like that, I tell stories like from the time before

30
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,120
Python had classes, or how we got along without decorators and descriptors, and things like

31
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
context managers.

32
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,120
But this is really about PyCon, because I was asked for memories about PyCon, and I

33
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,120
have a head full of memories that I want to share.

34
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,120
I did apply a little bit of scope creep, and I'll also talk about pre-PyCon conferences

35
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:52,120
and also about the PSF, its history, and sort of aspirational predecessors for the PSF.

36
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
This is all very personal.

37
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,120
The moral of the story is definitely going to be, if at first you don't succeed, try and try again,

38
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
because there were a few goof-ups.

39
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,120
So, earliest Python meetings, there were definitely Python meetings before we called them PyCon.

40
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,120
In particular, in 1994, we had the first Python workshop.

41
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:29,120
It was organized by Mike McLee in Maryland, and there were about 20 or 30 people.

42
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,120
It was a very small event, but it was a big success, at least we all had a little bit of a

43
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,120
big success, at least all 30 of us who attended thought it was a big success.

44
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,120
And we wanted to do more of that, and we quickly escalated from the Nth Python workshop to the Nth Plus First

45
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
International Python Conference.

46
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
I have more about that.

47
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,120
There were also early Python organizations long before the PSF.

48
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:06,120
Or at least, well, I don't know if there were actually Python organizations, there were attempts at organizing.

49
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,120
And this was separate from organizing events, because the event organization was in the end pretty successful

50
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
right from the start.

51
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:26,120
But the organization creation was a little bit challenging, and actually I have a story about how the PSF itself

52
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,120
almost suffocated in the cradle.

53
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,120
Oh, yeah.

54
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,120
This talk is not about the Python Secret Underground, because the Python Secret Underground does not exist.

55
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,120
Any rumors about its existence are false.

56
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,120
In fact, you never saw this slide, or I would have to kill you all.

57
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
Be warned.

58
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,120
So, yeah, the first Python workshop.

59
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:02,120
That was also the advent of, as far as I'm aware, the first Python T-shirt, and that is a long and venerable tradition.

60
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,120
The very first Python T-shirt, that's the logo on the front, there was something else on the back.

61
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Made by Steve Majewski, who stayed with the community a really long time.

62
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,120
It's really cool that we still have those T-shirts.

63
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,120
So here is actually the program of that first Python workshop.

64
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,120
You don't have to read all that, look at the things highlighted in yellow, and notice the Monty Python references,

65
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,120
which we also decided to work into the documentation.

66
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,120
But if you Google this, you can just ask Bing for first Python workshop 1994.

67
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,120
It's very important to put the year in, otherwise you get lots of other Python workshops that were held last week.

68
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:54,120
But really count how many current language features were proposed during that workshop or discussed.

69
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,120
And that's quite a few.

70
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,120
I don't want to go into them because it would become a Python retrospective again.

71
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:08,120
But based on the success of that workshop, we wanted to do more workshops.

72
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:17,120
And in fact, we did, six months later we did another one, organized by Jim Fulton of the United Geological Survey.

73
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,120
And we did a very interesting workshop, which was a very interesting one.

74
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,120
And six months after that, he ran another one.

75
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,120
And then we realized every six months, what are we thinking? How can we keep up with this?

76
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,120
People can't get travel budget every six months to travel to a Python workshop because their managers have never even heard of Python.

77
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:52,120
So we came to our census and we went annual. And it turns out annual is stressful enough.

78
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,120
So these events were organized initially by single individuals.

79
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,120
And these were individuals who had some clout with their organization to host small events.

80
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,120
And really all you needed was a meeting room for maybe 50 people at most.

81
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,120
Because small events are easy to organize.

82
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,120
We went to the cafeteria or to a nearby restaurant for lunch.

83
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,120
And the only visible expense was to make coffee appear during the breaks.

84
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,120
And then we transitioned to international Python conferences.

85
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:42,120
So this was really the fourth Python workshop organized by Paul Dubois at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in Livermore, California.

86
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:56,120
Now imagine the security implications of by then maybe 100 computer programmers swarming around on the facilities that were also used for the United States government's most secret nuclear research.

87
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,120
I don't know that we would be welcome there in today's climate.

88
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:16,120
But somehow in 97 or so we were, 96, they did ask for a copy of my passport several months in advance because I'm not even a U.S. citizen.

89
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,120
And Paul actually introduced a bunch of innovations that are still with us.

90
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:32,120
Not only did he rename it from workshop to conference, he invented, well introduced pre-conference tutorials.

91
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
Which we still have.

92
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,120
He was the first to announce that there was a dedicated hotel for the conference.

93
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
Although it was not exactly on the premises.

94
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,120
And so we changed the name to International Python Conference.

95
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:54,120
But we kept the numbering because we thought it would be more impressive if it was the fourth international Python conference.

96
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,120
And there had probably been one or two international guests to previous Python workshops.

97
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
Oh, like me.

98
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:12,120
So anyway, I actually, I have very personal memory from that conference that I can't really explain.

99
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
I'll just name the title.

100
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
The memory is titled, can you sproing the bunny?

101
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,120
And you've got to sort of track me down in the hallways to explain that one.

102
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:31,120
So after that, now I'm going to take a brief sip for my drink.

103
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:42,120
After the fourth international Python workshop, we realized that organizing these conferences was really a lot of work.

104
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,120
And even very high caliber volunteer like Paul Dubois couldn't quite cut it.

105
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:56,120
So in 97, the organization moved to a small for-profit company, Fortek Seminars.

106
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,120
And they were actually a subsidiary of CNRI, which was a nonprofit research lab that was my employer at the time.

107
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Fortek had some considerable experience organizing conferences because they organized the IETF meetings,

108
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:21,120
which are like gigantic meetings of the size of current PyCon, three times a year, I believe.

109
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,120
And they also ran the first few worldwide web conferences.

110
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,120
So we thought they knew what they were doing.

111
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,120
As a result, the prices for registration went up a bit.

112
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,120
The quality of the facilities also went up.

113
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,120
And sadly, as far as I know, Fortek never actually made a profit.

114
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,120
They were really hard to pin down on that, though.

115
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,120
So I'm not sure, but I don't think that they ever actually were successful.

116
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,120
So yay, PSF for being successful at making a little bit of money on these conferences.

117
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,120
The hotels did all right, of course.

118
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:09,120
So one of my best memories of any of the Fortek conferences was being snowed in in Washington, D.C.

119
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,120
We were at a hotel that no longer exists.

120
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
I think it was literally torn down.

121
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
It was the Key Bridge Marriott.

122
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
It had quite a bit of fame at the time.

123
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
And I lived pretty nearby.

124
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:29,120
So I actually tried to drive to the conference in the Marriott, and I was there.

125
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:36,120
I tried to drive to the conference in the morning, but the weather was kind of snowy and my car got stuck.

126
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,120
So it turns out I ran into a neighbor who said, oh, I'll give you a ride.

127
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,120
I work right next to the Key Bridge Marriott.

128
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
So he gave me a ride.

129
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,120
I arrived at the conference thinking that in the evening I'd catch a bus home or something.

130
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
Nah.

131
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
There was no way I could get back home.

132
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
And I was not prepared.

133
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,120
I had literally just sort of planned to drive there and drive back home.

134
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
I was offered this ride.

135
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,120
I had grabbed my bag and got on my neighbor's car.

136
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,120
So here I was snowed in for the next three days with no underwear.

137
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,120
Well, no fresh underwear.

138
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Fortunately, it turns out hotel gift shops do sell a small amount of that stuff.

139
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,120
And of course, it was a Python conference, so there was not a shortage of T-shirts.

140
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:41,120
So anyway, going back a little bit, there were also attempts at creating a Python organization.

141
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,120
But while meetings flourished, the organizations mostly fumbled.

142
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,120
In 95, there was a group of people in Washington, D.C.,

143
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,120
quite a bit of overlap with the people attending or being involved in the organization of the first workshop,

144
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,120
who said, we want to create an official Python nonprofit.

145
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,120
And they had a name ready for it, the Python Software Association.

146
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
It's a pretty good name.

147
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,120
But that's as far as they got.

148
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:22,120
But the next thing they did was start a mailing list discussion about what exactly should be in the bylaws of the Python Software Association.

149
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,120
And that kind of topic just doesn't converge.

150
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:38,120
Fortunately, to help us out, my employer, which was itself a nonprofit, offered a way out.

151
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,120
They would sort of host whatever that means.

152
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:48,120
The Python Software activity was not an association because association implies independence,

153
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,120
and activity apparently implies nothing in particular, but it was still the PSA.

154
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,120
It would not be an independent organization.

155
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,120
And in the end, it was just a mailing list that charged $50 for membership.

156
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,120
And you'd think, who would pay $50 for membership of a mailing list?

157
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Well, somehow a lot of people were looking for Python friends, and it was not as easy to find Python friends at the time.

158
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,120
So we had a lot of people.

159
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,120
I think we had 300 members or so at the high point of the Python Software activity.

160
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:32,120
And actually, when I was doing research for this talk, I even found that there were actually membership benefits besides being on the mailing list.

161
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,120
You got a registration discount to the fourth Python International Python Workshop.

162
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,120
That was the one at L&L.

163
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:48,120
So maybe that's why we got so many members, because they basically got their membership back in discount to the conference.

164
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:57,120
So another thing that we tried, somewhat more ambitiously, was a Python consortium.

165
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:09,120
And CNRI was familiar with the people who had started the World Wide Web Consortium and the X Windows Consortium, both of which, as far as I know, were run by MIT at the time.

166
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:19,120
And the idea was there would be members, which would be large corporations, who would pay a hefty sponsorship fine for a seat at the table.

167
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:27,120
And exactly what was being discussed at that table, or whether it was a dinner table or a dining philosopher's table, I don't know.

168
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,120
Presumably, the idea was that they would have a say in language design.

169
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,120
And that had worked for the X Windows Consortium and again for the World Wide Web.

170
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,120
So why would it not work for Python?

171
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Who wouldn't want to pay for a say in Python's design?

172
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Well, at the time, in around 1997 or so, Python was apparently unimportant enough that we couldn't get anyone to sign up as the first member of this consortium.

173
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
We got some nibbles from Hewlett-Packard.

174
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,120
They were trying to launch a big Python-based product, which was actually pretty amazing at the time.

175
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,120
But in the end, even that was not really enough to get the Python Consortium started.

176
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,120
And none of the other big names in software were at all interested.

177
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,120
So scratch that.

178
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,120
Now, I have a blank slide because I want to sort of protect the innocence.

179
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,120
But around 2000, I left CNRI and I did something unforgivable.

180
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:40,120
And I didn't realize at the time how unforgivable it was because I convinced like four coworkers to leave with me.

181
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
And we went in a startup adventure.

182
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,120
And the idea was that we wanted to do something that was a little bit more interesting.

183
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:00,120
We went in a startup adventure and the adventure was a terrible disaster and we had to be rescued by another startup.

184
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:17,120
But anyway, because of the way we left, it was kind of awkward to have CNRI in charge of any Python-related things like the Python software activity or the international Python conferences.

185
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:31,120
If you want to understand more about why we decided to left apart from dot com fever, look at the license file for CPython in our GitHub repo.

186
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,120
Anyway, what were we to do organization wise?

187
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:48,120
Fortunately, one of the active core devs at the time was Greg Stein, who came up with a brilliant tactic to avoid getting stuck in the bylaws quagmire again.

188
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:56,120
He happened to be a board member of the Apache Software Foundation and Apache had already solved all these problems.

189
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,120
They had working bylaws for an open source software organization foundation.

190
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:14,120
And so Greg's proposal was that we take the Apache Software Foundation's fish license, I mean bylaws, cross out Apache and write in Python in Crayon.

191
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,120
So that's what we decided to do and there really wasn't much more to it.

192
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:33,120
We did have a false start in 2000, but in 2001 we did actually get incorporated and by 2003 Python was, the PSF was feeling quite real.

193
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:39,120
We did have a bank account, we had a post office box, we even had a part-time admin I believe.

194
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Oh, let me say a bit more about that false start.

195
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:56,120
We were all gung-ho about getting the PSF started in 2000 and yet if you look up the official paperwork on python.org, if you know how to do your Bing searches, you'll see that it was incorporated in 2001.

196
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Well, the way I remember the story was there was like somewhere in 2000 was a conference, it must have been still one of the IPCs, and about 20 people got together who were the founding members of the PSF.

197
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,120
It was mostly early days core devs and there were a few small companies with big plans and big hearts.

198
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:26,120
But of course, a number of practical things had to be done like getting the legal paperwork filed, opening a bank account, setting up a PO box maybe even hiring a part-time admin and such.

199
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,120
But we were a bunch of computer pilots and we had to do everything in our power to make it work.

200
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,120
So fortunately, one of us was already a successful businessman.

201
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,120
He was not a core dev, he was one of these small companies with a big heart.

202
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,120
But he was already successful and he knew how to do stuff.

203
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,120
And so he volunteered to be a part-time admin and he was a part-time engineer.

204
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,120
And he was a part-time engineer at the time.

205
00:20:53,120 --> 00:21:03,120
And then a year passed and at the next and final international Python conference in 2001, I think it was the last one, nothing had happened.

206
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,120
It turns out that if you're a really successful business person, you're not going to be able to do anything.

207
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,120
And so we had to do something.

208
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
And so we had to do something.

209
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,120
And so we had to do something.

210
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:27,720
But it was so, so nice to be dedicated,

211
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:35,120
or so kind, to get a job in the back of a bank account.

212
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:42,480
Fortunately, my new employers, Paul Everett, he is here, and Rob Pike of Zoab Corporation

213
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,040
offered the help of their corporate attorney to get it done, and it was done.

214
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:54,560
And we did do it using Apache bylaws with Python written in in Crayon.

215
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:01,140
So at last, okay, according to my notes, the last IPC was actually in 2002, so the chronology

216
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:07,740
is a bit murky, I think, because conferences are planned so far in advance, it was difficult

217
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:16,180
for Fortek to stop organizing Python conferences without losing even more money on commitments.

218
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,860
But what we were going to do for 2003, now O'Reilly, bless their hearts, offered us a

219
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:28,180
track at the open source conference, OSCON, but informally we still mostly thought of

220
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,740
that as the Pearl Conference.

221
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:39,460
So even though the Python community accepted a track at OSCON as sort of a consolation

222
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:46,380
prize for losing our own international Python conference, we weren't all that much into

223
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,380
it.

224
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,520
Also, I think OSCON is even more expensive than IPC ever was.

225
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:59,640
So the PSF having been freshly incorporated and by 2003 actually having been set up completely

226
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:06,340
and even having a little bit of money in that bank account, and this is an important part,

227
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,200
we got a stroke of luck.

228
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,640
I got a phone call.

229
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:16,400
Late 2002, I got a phone call from, guess what, a Pearl community organizer who had

230
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:23,640
a venue where he had planned to hold a Pearl community conference which for some reason

231
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,760
had to be canceled.

232
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,800
Maybe there was a glut of Pearl community conferences that year.

233
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,680
And so he asked if I was interested in using that venue and that particular week that he

234
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,040
had reserved it for a Python community conference.

235
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,280
And I said, sure.

236
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:47,400
I don't know where we came up with the name PyCon, but that was not an entirely sort of

237
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,280
random name.

238
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:55,000
I think many people probably could have come up with that name for the Python conference.

239
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,920
And really the rest is history and I don't even have that many more stories to tell except,

240
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,680
oh yeah.

241
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:10,240
One thing because the venue came through me and I was I think the president of the PSF

242
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,720
at the time and I sort of was an important connection point and so I ended up being the

243
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,520
main organizer.

244
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:27,840
So I had to negotiate with the venue over money and catering and so here's the refrain.

245
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,300
Being a computer programmer, I had no skills in this area.

246
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:39,900
And so for one example, I ended up ordering exactly the same menu of sandwiches for three

247
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,220
days in a row.

248
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:49,660
And I'm sure it was the cheapest option three days in a row because I was terrified finally

249
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,740
seeing the prices they charge for sandwiches.

250
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,140
And I think the larger the conference, the larger the higher the price per sandwich.

251
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:04,500
Anyway, there were complaints and I turned that into my advantage.

252
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:11,100
I decided to delegate and the next year someone else was handling the catering and the negotiations.

253
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:17,300
And we had a total of three fantastic conferences at George Washington University.

254
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:24,580
After that I think we grew too much and we sort of wouldn't fit and we looked for different venues.

255
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:30,740
So conference registration is also incredibly stressful.

256
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,420
So this was our first conference.

257
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:40,220
So for that first Python workshop, I personally sent emails to everyone I wanted to show up

258
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,420
there and they all said yes, I'll be there.

259
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,940
So that was easy.

260
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:51,900
For PyCon 1, we advertised on Python.org and on the mailing list and we had a little bit

261
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:57,180
of registration automation and then we were looking at registrations trickle in.

262
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,980
And you said like a month before the conference or so there's an early birth registration

263
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:07,620
deadline and a few days before the deadline we had a few dozen registrations.

264
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,340
And this caused considerable stress because we already had pretty much committed to paying

265
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,180
for all those sandwiches.

266
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:24,380
So then fortunately it turns out that procrastination is universal human nature and on the afternoon

267
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:30,860
of the final day that you could register at the early birth rate, hundreds, well at least

268
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:35,260
a hundred registrations came in and everything was fine.

269
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:42,140
And then again like one or two days before the final deadline of the conference, like

270
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:48,060
one or two days before the actual conference, we got a lot more registrations from people

271
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:54,100
who didn't care about the early birth discount but who also were procrastinating on whether

272
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,260
they would actually come or not.

273
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:00,740
Anyway, this seems to be universal.

274
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,020
But we were saved and it was a big success.

275
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,380
So fast forward to what happened in 2008.

276
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:16,740
You might remember that in 2008 the world and PyCon were hit by the financial crisis.

277
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,100
This was pretty stressful.

278
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,820
People were worried about their jobs.

279
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,380
People lost their jobs.

280
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:27,580
Big name software conferences were being canceled left and right.

281
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,580
We didn't know what to do.

282
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:36,500
Shall we still have the conference and hope that enough people show up or shall we cancel

283
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,300
it and forfeit a huge deposit to the hotels.

284
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:49,620
In the end we decided to do it because otherwise we'd be definitely in the hole for a huge

285
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:55,300
amount of money, probably several times the cost of the first PyCon by then.

286
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,980
So we stuck with it.

287
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:03,140
We did run at a loss but the PSF had been prudently saving up for bad times and so this

288
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,340
was one of the bad times.

289
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,340
And we made it.

290
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:14,220
The PSF did not go bankrupt as a result and years after that the world and PyCon recovered

291
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,300
from the crisis.

292
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:23,860
And I was very happy that the PSF by then had financial staff who were careful with

293
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,940
money management.

294
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,260
I see that I'm out of time.

295
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,080
I have one more stressful memory.

296
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:38,640
There was a year that I procrastinated on my keynote so badly that I was almost in tears.

297
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,880
It was like I was at the conference and of course when I'm at the conference I have no

298
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,040
time for anything.

299
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
I had no slides.

300
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,600
I had no story I wanted to tell.

301
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,960
I didn't know what to do and I confess that to one of the conference organizers who alerted

302
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,960
Steve Holden.

303
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,440
I don't recall if Steve was at the time conference chair or if he had he definitely had been

304
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,120
conference chair in years past.

305
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,760
I knew him well.

306
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,360
He said let's go to dinner.

307
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,280
He fed me dinner, calmed me down and proposed a super simple solution.

308
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,200
He said let's have a fireside chat.

309
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,940
That means we put two comfy chairs on stage and Steve interviews me.

310
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,400
No preparation required.

311
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:33,560
I'm sure Steve had to prepare a bit because he had to come up with some questions.

312
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:38,640
Knowing me he probably knew that all he needed to do was prepare the first question and the

313
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,600
rest would happen without his intervention.

314
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,720
Anyway it worked fantastically.

315
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,440
We repeated that format later.

316
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,880
I very much still procrastinate.

317
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,540
That's why I'm talking last today.

318
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:03,140
Speaking of conference chairs, that is genuinely one of the most stressful jobs I know of.

319
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:09,780
I know several past PyCon chairs personally who burned out as a direct result of being

320
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,060
conference chair.

321
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:18,400
Fortunately nowadays the PyCon staff and the PS staff are providing a tremendous amount

322
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
of support.

323
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,600
In the beginning we all had to figure it out by ourselves.

324
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:32,600
Nevertheless, boy am I glad I was not Emily in 2020 when she had to decide to cancel PyCon

325
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,480
because of the pandemic.

326
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,600
Anyway thanks to all the conference chairs past.

327
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,900
And let me hand it back to the conference chair current Mariada and her team.

328
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,400
Thank you all.
