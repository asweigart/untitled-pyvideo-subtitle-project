My name is Janicebi, and this is my last talk today.

28
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
My first show is Go Davin and Welcome to Blay zooms.

29
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:58,360
This is my first duration show FOR crap and cảmию private about the favorite artists,

30
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,020
it didn't even turn on the winning family's

31
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,520
mobile.

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,960
We were going to get someone

33
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,700
to look at

34
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,460
the

35
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:02,920
final design

36
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,720
for

37
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,520
Nobody else

38
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,420
to

39
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,140
figure

40
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,700

41
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,380
who

42
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:07,880
they

43
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,580
have

44
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,600
to

45
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,540
look

46
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,680
at

47
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,180
So

48
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,160
we

49
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,600
got

50
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,020

Annabelle

53
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,080
Wow

54
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,040
小心

55
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,200
careful

56
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,600
I

57
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,420
didn't

58
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,980
carry

59
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,480
the

60
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:26,820
cats

61
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,320
I

62
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,820
couldn't

63
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,020
One of these challenges is that you can go to

64
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:45,280
other clients and

65
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,960
they can be quite busy and as an example you can

66
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,260
make them really cakes and get along with them.

67
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,360
It's interacting with friends and it немножко

68
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,480
As we work it out for us, we have to do something.

69
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,800
I was a customer and I wasn't lying.

70
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,760
Claeser's wife, Acceptor to Goodbye,

71
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,460
was breaking me in and practicing at High Street.

72
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,420
In the stands Sunday,

73
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:11,840
he thought he'd beaten out a big failure

74
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,620
to be able to get into the line-up.

75
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,340
That's right.

76
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,640
Oh, and immediately,

77
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,340
you're working your dog,

78
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,260
that's even better,

79
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,720
that doesn't mean what you did famous,

80
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,400
but not really because you can't learn from TN.

81
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,380
It was clear that that,

82
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,160
yes, I'm here in Chicago.

83
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,960
I can talk in high speed.

84
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,040
I think, after I arrived in the stadium,

85
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Let us었던 icEp.

86
00:02:46,040 --> 00:03:16,040
I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this

87
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:23,180
because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because I'm not just saying this because a way of

88
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:37,920
a majority heart or whatever in federation

89
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,100
we're doing actually third group

90
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,100
It sounds as though I'm actually surfing on the field...

91
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,100
But I can actually show off to other people on the stage,

92
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,100
對不起, to anyone else and everyone else on the stage,

93
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,100
It's embarrassed in anyhow.

94
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,100
I'ts a bit embarrassing to carry that word around in this period...

95
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,100
but I guess you get to be allowed to go out and party if you like again.

96
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,100
This year Lionel Buquell is one of the champions.

97
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,100
It's the best name in history,

98
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,700
Good Plus, you'll really get to be there if you go to one of my shows.

99
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,100
And it can be the best,

100
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,100
if you keep coming out and keep doing the hard stuff...

101
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,100
With the finish line은 15-17m...

102
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,260
Because you can also see the difference.

103
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,640
So if the initial aim was to achieve the same goal

104
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,880
where we're getting rejuvenated,

105
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,640
then I believe that production can be extremely challenging.

106
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,900
So I believe when the flesh is the most important quiero

107
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,020
It should not be athletics, if it's not technical ability to that

108
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,360
I can remember from that decade –

109
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,000
Do not구 Чм empiezaắng это не blond könnte

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:52,700

For most of our customers the stock price to budget is зад monitor with on the cylinder

147
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:28,280
The number of customers who come in with the stock price, is generally extremely high

148
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,760
We need a competitive middle class customer and other neutral hundreds for velocity

153
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,520
I don't know, a real translator

154
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,920

158
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,160
I mean she does makers for arts

159
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,420
so they thunder

160
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,520

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,060
and the rest is just a blend of the two.

185
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,060
And the other reason why I'm saying this is because

186
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,060
I think that the fact that the

187
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,060
people who are interested in this project

188
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,060
is because they are interested in this project

189
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,060
and they are interested in this project.

190
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,060
And I think that the other reason why I think that

191
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,060
the other reason why I think that

192
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,060
the other reason why I think that

193
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,060
the other reason why I think that

194
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,060
the other reason why I think that

195
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,060
the other reason why I think that

196
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,060
a weakness in this community

197
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:47,800
is because of our

198
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,220
to the

199
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,160
first

200
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,960
.

201
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,800
All in all, meaning anything of the most creative can be seen?...

202
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,840
Now the teacher then merywates some medicinal 팀s or

203
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:37,540
texts prior the

204
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,740
the

205
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,940
meaning of remedy

206
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,940
Obviously, most of them are being restricted,

207
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,860
with the needs of not only them,

208
00:10:46,860 --> 00:11:07,760
withanging and

209
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,760
We are just trying to make different efforts

210
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,880
with the best of our own and the best of our own

211
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,040
to make this work.

212
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,600
We can't just keep going on and on.

213
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,320
We can't just go on and on.

214
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,760
We can't just make it.

215
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,160
We can't just make it.

216
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,840
So, you have to have a big family.

217
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,040
They're all in a room.

218
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,920
They're all in a room.

219
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,680
They're all in a room.

220
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,120
If you're in a room, you're not going to make it.

221
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,840
You're not going to make it.

222
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,240
So, what's going to make a difference

223
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
in the way we make it?

224
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,440
What's the meaning?

225
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,040
We just tried doing different ways

226
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,640
to make different things, really, get it together.

227
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,320
And thinking about the emperor in their head.

228
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,200
The emperor thought that in the mortal world,

229
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,680
there are too many

230
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,000
and the people of the world

231
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,520
had to be destroyed.

232
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,800
If we nation was over,

233
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,200
what guided us had our own

234
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,660
They often put sound Livestrrip sound on a

235
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,980
l Love her a Love him up

236
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,740
A little bit on the distance

237
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,320
He objected though his

238
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,120
fans of complexity

239
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,680
They Fairy

240
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,140
Andiga

241
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,720
China

242
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,700
To

243
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,120
The

244
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,520
But definitely more important than we had already discovered.

245
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,840
Also, previous on different

246
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,800
numbers Batteries and Looks

247
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,420
and we could that we already thrill

248
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,700
at other edges of��-yay

249
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,860
Yes indeed,

250
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,020
is very often Chaaaaorg私持私身

251
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:56,740
And we could network,

252
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,020
But proved that 당wers do this before.

253
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,140
In entropy has been an interesting

254
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,440
perception placed at the English roulette Taipei

255
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,580
So that this has our leadership

256
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,960
And the Japanese weight class

257
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,300
should be performing well,

258
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,680
all by a time the darkness is gone

259
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,020
so that dessert and such

260
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,200
are that they are the strength

261
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,140
of all people,

262
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,900
but if you believe that

263
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,120
there really is someone

264
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
who put too much focus

265
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,560
Bossing in a Node

266
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,180
So, it's possible that use onex

267
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,700
will fridge into the tonic

268
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,060
You spend a nap around

269
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,000
Every week, right?

270
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,800
In the morning

271
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,200
Youngass

272
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,300
And their company

273
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,600
Why this

274
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,560
Is a bit tricky

275
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,760
To collect

276
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,800
With the

277
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
Being all dressed up

278
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,500
With white dismissal

279
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,000
And fresh

280
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,500
Two days

281
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,400
is a王 serv 감사합니다 !

282
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,400
use your knowledge !

283
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,500
to launch the mission of armed assistance

284
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
we must provide the mission

285
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,280
not to install the transportation

286
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,300
and if it's necessary

287
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,000
it can be expanded

288
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,500
and and

289
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,420
it will remain

290
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,460
more вд soon

291
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,520
since civil society

292
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,060
that improves

293
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,260
and does it

294
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,280
visit to Blue LITHI.

295
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,320
As I said I don't think we could Turkey can record...

296
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,440
because the term video zero means the average quality of the penis so it's good

297
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,500
만든 sen taximani can record like an average of six wonsoft pred suitable toas

298
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,620
so imagine this is not Id algorithm and we are not going to commit to SA unfortunately

299
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,920
partner video zero basically

300
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,000
we don't want a device video at all

301
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,940
but I think it's better to have video zero

302
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,560
because then you can't use any data

303
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,660
likeamazX

304
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:41,640
who

305
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,640
And this is the most interesting one of them.

306
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,640
It's about two minutes, two minutes,

307
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
and then you're ready.

308
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,640
You can have a few more seconds to listen to the sound

309
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,640
and then you can speak.

310
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,640
And then you can also take a short break.

311
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,640
And then you can listen to the sound

312
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,640
and then you can listen to the sound again.

313
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,640
And then you can have a few more seconds

314
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,640
to go back.

315
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,640
And if you like some better.

316
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,640
Um,

317
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,640
own by a

318
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:49,600
Who, the

319
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,140
It's smelly and dirty and dark

320
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,780
It's also dangerous, dangerous and scary

321
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:09,240
Which means if we collect this

322
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,640
Then we become very sick

323
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,100
The next step

324
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,200
Is to protect ourselves

325
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,460
And furthermore, this planet

326
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:17,700
Now we can taste the

327
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,180
I think that, in the definition of complication,

328
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,700
the difference between expressed andBra�

329
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,180
In the sub......

330
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,580
So what's growing during this trick,

331
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,200
and what we're

332
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,200
talking about by now,

333
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,440
losses have almost been settlements

334
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,860
because the currency is smaller.

335
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,740
For some very manufacturers,

336
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,140
for the ones that are far ahead,

337
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,940
the real chance of DR.

338
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,180
And in the sub......

339
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:54,060
because if people think that can both vorne be a grade it can be criteria to get through

340
00:17:54,060 --> 00:18:11,960
the

341
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,460
He escaped in askry Damnai

342
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,160
Why do we have to do this for you

343
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:34,860
our

344
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:49,000
I believe we could not understand the

345
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,940
whole purpose that mum'm not saying but

346
00:18:51,940 --> 00:19:00,240
that they are slices of a diagram.

347
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,860
You just didn't know how to expand the

348
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,160
diversity and expertise of the

349
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,240
people who are here today.

350
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,080
Life is through departed cabbage,

351
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,520
You seek a safe haven for an unOne.

352
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,840
Early birdies all the time,

353
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,960
tearing up the

354
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,100
rough cover on theasted

355
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,580
side and insert it early

356
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,380
that the well worn

357
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,640
and pretentious

358
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,780
statues have a

359
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,740
pork back

360
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,800
jugful body.

361
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,880
Why am I

362
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,180
just in a good way

363
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,440
she thought?

364
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,540
When after the

365
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,100
little

366
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,500
cradle

367
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,960
it first

368
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,100
filled with

369
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,020
corn Hyun- dancing

370
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,440
and the

371
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,440
I think this is a great opportunity to reflect that in our world today.

372
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,440
I think we all have to do both.

373
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,440
I think we all have to do both.

374
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
I think we all have to do both.

375
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
I think we all have to do both.

376
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
I think we all have to do both.

377
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
I think we all have to do both.

378
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
I think we all have to do both.

379
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
I think we all have to do both.

380
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
I think we all have to do both.

381
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
I think we all have to do both.

382
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
I think we all have to do both.

383
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
I think we all have to do both.

384
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
I think we all have to do both.

385
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
I think we all have to do both.

386
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
I think we all have to do both.

387
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,440
I think weall wling to the same goal ofushi

388
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,440
tion...

389
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,440
...to movements that will sees conduct

390
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
We shouldoxide ourselves to that goal.

391
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,340
there is no doubt that it has very strong influence and potential.

392
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,780
There is no doubt that this is a truly Kimchi,

393
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,680
such a korean korean dish.

394
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,900
Many, many years ago

395
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,760
when we were kimchi,

396
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,000
there was a

397
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,900
anyways this is kimchi,

398
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,640
food, and infusing tablecloth.

399
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,420
It's something that through our society

400
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:30,300
Enter

401
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:44,860
the

402
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,860
by the benefit of technology that dissolved and our defense system was set up

403
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,940
as they destroyed and we started

404
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,020
leading our policy of

405
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,820
...

406
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,780
staking their efforts

407
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,820
i.e.

408
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,680
enhancing the titled

409
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:05,240
Jungle

410

jack

412
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,240
you are secretly traveling together with a Wherever It Is Party.

413
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,500
Then after an hour using a A floppy,

414
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,280
just a four- maths book

415
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,340
just a shoplift

416
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:33,560
or a

417
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,200
department store

418
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,160
and прям

419
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,840
So if you have imilaqu shootings,

420
00:22:37,840 --> 00:23:06,060

Turks

423
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:44,320
to a woman who then got into a European Academy and established was appointed byание

424
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,480
that we had to provide entire student's services.

425
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,980
And via bow了 nod to the girl they would leave out for a business,

426
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,400
we had to run out them up in every one of them.

427
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
We hadn't enough money at home.

428
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,820
We had to raise money to spend on things that were ringing in the remove system.

429
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,740
about it.

430
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:08,560
Thanks very much, movies and swimming,

431
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,980
you.

432
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,360
Cheers!

433
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,300
Cheers again andportal 반 aboard.

434
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
The process.

435
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,020
I'm going through one of these images within 7 seconds.

436
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,880
So-called

437
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,460
example I use this to represent a French warrior or a mentalata.

438
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:45,360
This is all about then you can whom you like with the

439
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,340
Internet is like�

440
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,580
send

441
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,060
and slots provided to robot

442
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:00,300
by the use of county automobiles or agricultural robotic systems.

443
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,620
what they found?

444
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,180
there was a kind of fusion of 641 agreeence

445
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,020
and in some cases, heavenly

446
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,300
but in other cases, the version worker

447
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,160
and one of the weakest

448
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,400
traditional paths

449
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,080
I feel, we're going to have a good time, but there's bigger room

450
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,320
in our collective to navigate that overall.

451
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,560
And that's what I, I refer to in my research and education

452
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,640
in New York Program is social media supporters,

453
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,660
who're concluding a symmetric research effort

454
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,660
and then coming back in rising angel church.

455
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,120
So we're cualifying people who have access to the screen

456
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,720
to sort of make phones do this modeling

457
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,880
to figure out what one does,

458
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,700
and then finally,agoGirl events

459
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,720
and what does anyone else do

460
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,280
considering transparent police efficiency.

461
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,800
Meaning the shares that we are in and around

462
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,500
Bployage change criticism,

463
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,280
Bailout,

464
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,260
Take on government,

465
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:25,960
legalization,

466
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:42,000
Bailout of

467
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,780
Thank you very much.

468
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,760
I just want to say one other thing that

469
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,760
Anela And Friday, electrons.

470
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,880
It's

471
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,840
all

472
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,660
it's

473
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,660
stupid

474
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,620
And that's sort of why, with the helmets for the health care system,

475
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,700
the patients who will use the helmets,

476
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,420
we're always giving them coats.

477
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,860
It's a good question.

478
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,120
Ouch it hurts.

479
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,980
Well, they can be demographics.

480
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,300
That weapon isn't scary at all.

481
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,560
Make it go away.

482
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,460
But, and that's also the kind of

483
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,820
coding thing we can do because

484
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,820
and I'm still going with it.

485
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,820
And I'm not a different person.

486
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,820
And this is a very interesting project

487
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,820
that I'm doing, and I'm pretty much

488
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,820
in every phase.

489
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,820
And this is a project that I've done

490
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,820
with each of the different communities

491
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,820
in the world.

492
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,820
And I'm not sure

493
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,820
if it's a success or not.

494
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,820
But I think that we

495
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,820
have to be aware of

496
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,820
the value of the community

497
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,820
and the value of the community

498
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,920
of respect

499
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,220
when it comes to working at Pioneers Economics.

500
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,220
And this project is

501
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,000
something that I'm happy to help

502
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,260
with together with the School of

503
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,920
Business, but also with the

504
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,920
Department of Finance.

505
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
And if not, then why should we

506
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,920
be doing this together?

507
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,920
The Pay height district

508
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,920
is Vaseline Creek,

509
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,920
it's really close by

510
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,920
and you usually

511
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:50,600
and you know, you're going to happen to face a risk-based kind of

512
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,880
prone должноostAdam has a raised family,

513
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,400
because he has diagnosed somebody

514
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,120
that he couldn't sign,

515
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,280
and it's really only after he's fully diagnosed

516
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,540
and immunised French is having floor Sawyer's

517
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,400
But if you don't know how this works,

518
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,800
in upcoming years it's going to be difficult

519
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,960
He then handed this to an old friend, the first man named Wend!!!!

520
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,800
He Egyptian triumphs and the king canceled his role as a

521
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,960
guardian wrapped iniscovered...

522
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:44,580
there will be a mission to defend Radiomir Lad う GB

523
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,120
This facility, or to be more specific,會在층 done to donate,

524
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,940
we hoped that it seeks to assista greater service and experience not only in a weeded vegetable garden,

525
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,020
this would be the practice they would follow into theорgy for every product.

526
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:10,800
To the right of the desk we would RGB the

527
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,160
in that I did not want to be basically the prey

528
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,860
to describe to others

529
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:21,480
the

530
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,020
various

531
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:26,940
manners

532
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,220
that are

533
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,000
the fastest

534
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,280
than the

535
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,180
velvet

536
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,080
and the

537
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,080
streika

538
00:30:38,080 --> 00:31:01,500
which I have experienced dubbed such практически motorized

539
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,280
is a social relation between theeler denial and the

540
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,760
distribution ridership and the

541
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,980
across discussion tunnel of steam

542
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,180
th estimation that is about

543
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,780
20 years the public traffic

544
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,300
suffers a significant reduction

545
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,800
80% of the cleaners and

546
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,220
container interestingly for the

547
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,820
international service release

guide midnight

549
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,460
More on that from a philosophical

550
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,440
story from the

551
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,180
description of se was

552
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,920
which question

553
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,520
A variety of places you can upload something in and ask for help.

554
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,520
A very small project has yet to be completed.

555
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,220
I think meeting generally helps usρώ sell ourselves själv aingo,

556
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:46,720
and that communities can get really good at working together.

557
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,120
objectives of this project are to recent element

558
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,000
society, we should all identify the arrows that are

559
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,560
ε いつかど prisatá naلام,

560
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,160
and, travelling around the world.

561
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,260
I'd say є obviously easier if you

562
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:53,680
if

563
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,820
your

564
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:01,800
as a psychological simulation and this poisonous body is walking on the ground

565
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,720
in aykidan Then Leaders speak about them

566
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:25,640
It all went as if the lens became sure this system, the additionalめ

567
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:35,600
behind the Kyiv

568
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,680
players

569
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:45,640
until

570
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,920
At this trickery

571
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,360
I want it to be

572
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:18,960
Uh,

573
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,820
as easy as it can be

574
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,240
Sadly, but

575
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,320
the next 3D thing was

576
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,940
participating

577
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:39,380
of this program

578
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:46,560
more decentralized and more economic and Go х3 will be easier to see in the Danny

579
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,600
Housing District and in most input areas.

580
00:34:50,600 --> 00:35:06,440
There are about 200 beds that O будут swoje

581
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,340
And I think people are going images,

582
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,640
because how you can just Moai is just셔

583
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:46,500
Like is just, is the border of event space like,

584
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,860
I have a computer that I take,

585
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,020
And I just put it on and click.

586
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,520
And I'm like,

587
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,720
I have a computer.

588
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,460
You know combined with the memory pho,

589
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,860
I mean we are not too far off,

590
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,640
Because it provides for the我们

591
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,640
and so many of us have been working on it for a long time.

592
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
So we've done it. It's also been a good start.

593
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
So it's a strong one.

594
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,640
So it's a good one.

595
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,640
It's a good one. It's just a good one.

596
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,640
But I think for a year, we need to get started on it.

597
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,640
And I've seen it going. It's a good show.

598
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,640
We've had a good production. It's a good show.

599
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,640
It's a good player. It's a good show.

600
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
But I think it's a good show.

601
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,640
And I think it's a good show.

602
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
It's a good show.

603
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,640
It's a good show.

604
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,640
It's a very good show.

605
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,640
It was a good one.

606
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,640
Very good show.

607
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,640
It's a very good show.

608
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,640
And I think the performance to this one a little bit.

609
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,640
I said we need to be strong in the LHV Tree harmony for it.

610
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:27,020
as look at the

611
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
Hot, hot, hot

612
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:37,700
Wait guys, H

613
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,700
what the heck

614
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,140
you scared me

615
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,240
I'm sorry

616
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,040
This channel has been playing for a long time

617
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,980
it is quite test

618
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,000
but

619
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,440
It don't look like it

620
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,780
I know that

621
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,020
I was really surprised at the fact that Asian ended up being the level five.

622
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:13,940
But for years today, it's widely that it's very much

623
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:20,580
challenging, but it's important for us to get through.

624
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:24,440
These are just four of them which are still under 맛이 though-

625
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,300
the real interesting thing is not that I'm pleased with,

626
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,520
I'm fortunate is that, in the course of a discussion I'm happy to say

627
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,620
that waves ofck is surface as a relationship,

628
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,200
that is the responsibility of every person that's veya edante to

629
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:39,280
an entire Sadhguru in the

630
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,740
world the paddy and Peter Colon.

631
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,100
And L, it has sort of been outdated in that

632
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,100
and I'm sure you know that if you want to

633
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,100
be a part of this project,

634
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,100
you can just go for it.

635
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,100
The process can just be so much easier

636
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,100
and it's so much easier

637
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,100
and you can really just do it

638
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,100
and it's so much easier when it's a piece of

639
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,100
much easier stuff that you can just

640
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,100
do it so much easier.

641
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,100
Thank you.

642
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,100
And I'm going to ask you a question

643
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,100
that I've been thinking about

644
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,100
and it's like, you know,

645
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
for that project, what are the things that

646
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,100
that you've definitely been12ing at

647
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,100
you've been really losing that

648
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:27,100
flexibility from

649
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,100
moving ahead

650
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,100
and get the different objects

651
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,100
to work on

652
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,100
now for a new year.

653
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,100
Things get much more Norwegian

654
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,100
of Please Let It Go

655
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,100
and the people

656
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,280
of the

657
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,060
community.

658
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:45,560
Frieden

659
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,560
�BS

660
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,060
development

661
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:50,580
everyone

662
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,420
shift

663
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,460
from

664
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:57,940
our

665
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:00,820
draw

666
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:06,860
that

667
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,180
that

668
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,300
in

669
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:11,780
good

670
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,940
I believe more shelter in treas Jimin in the community

671
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,800
Because here has to be first adapter

672
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,380
to the state of earth

673
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,880
Can I ask about this kind of thing at all...

674
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,520
a civilization has to protect them

675
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,140
for they to have a place to live

676
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,640
in the relative rejuvenation, the life for the people

677
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,900
Why do you think this happened?

678
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,320
I mean now

679
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,000
It just cóse to happen

680
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,660
in this last time

681
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,040
segregation is a new problem

682
00:40:41,040 --> 00:41:03,260
the

683
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,760
focus

684
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,720
I invited some colleagues that were not appropriate.

685
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,420
We go very close.

686
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,460
You go, you set the date on the house and I know,

687
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,360
there's no doubt that it's currently rough,

688
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,360
but the US herself, is afraid it's going to do

689
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,060
shelter from head on INTER%.

690
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,840
So she took me elsewhere.

691
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,280
I don't think you have that kind of mercy to this.

692
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,700
It's extremely tough for a movement like this

693
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,260
when we have sick youths like you,

694
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,340
to actually allocate a funding for your studies in constituents Gimmea.

695
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,360
And you can discuss a chicken breed that will make specific performed

696
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,380
papers, pizza iron or potato pie for the follow River flavouring options,

697
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:50,420
and agree that your balance sheet is correct.

698
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:56,460
If you find a birdsYear equation in a data сказuty and

699
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:00,460
it's made for that requirement, you can also direct it to Smored

700
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,180
Because of why I get so manyанилоes from children about

701
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,980
how to get anything out.

702
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,300
I can't seem to think any right.

703
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,420
In some ways I don't know why.

704
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,080
But it kinda seems to me he's expensive food like

705
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,460
or is it cruise is expensive.

706
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,380
It's expensive!

707
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,620
For example it does not make sense that

708
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,220
children read Watching Stars all the time.

709
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,020
That's amazing.

710
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,460
So I want to answer about this case.

711
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:33,300
and it's who elaps3, most important was Raph San certainly.

712
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,480
Will that feature upload make that siempre?

713
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,520
Bridge that place will continue to be bounds

714
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,980
but we're going to throw forward this to get you to that

715
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,740
tool that will hype for us on how we should now

716
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,820
together we'll find a plan between a three hours

717
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,700
or a whole four times a long break to have

718
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,860
a wants-up withdrived multitrack

719
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,860
So, it's very timely.

720
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,860
I like the way it's going.

721
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:04,860
But, it's already the

722
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,860
key step in this is

723
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,860
the first row, the first row, the first row.

724
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,860
And it's very easy to see the key step in it.

725
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,860
And I think that will just be

726
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,860
the most important thing I know.

727
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,860
Let's go.

728
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,860
This is the first row.

729
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,860
This is the first row.

730
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,860
And this is the first row.

731
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:52,860
So, he had this

732
00:43:52,860 --> 00:44:01,640
UCGP,FBE,we don't have a letter like that,you only have calendar or something like that

733
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:07,180
So I wanted to speak to you guys be rangenar european civilization,how it works

734
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:13,140
As you know this사가 IST green and black sea creation

735
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:18,400
If you wanted to conference without ways of Intel Meltdown

736
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,080
Ohh.

737
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,080
Ah okay.

738
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:44,200
That's actually my

739
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,200
I think it's kind of funny that the government has turned its attention to the

740
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,200
industry because it's been really difficult for us to see what we're doing.

741
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,200
We're not really looking at the industry in a very specific way.

742
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:58,200
So, I think that the government has turned its attention to the industry in a very specific way.

743
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,200
I think that the government has turned its attention to the industry in a very specific way.

744
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,200
And I think that the government has turned its attention to the industry in a very specific way.

745
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,200
So, I think that the government has turned its attention to the industry in a very specific way.

746
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,200
We look at cars in zeros.

747
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,940
Some people actually have three cars with a

748
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,940
benchmark of Ama Pronunciation on a C.

749
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:24,200
There's always a buy- put.

750
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,200
Not those few people get a try.

751
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,200
There's the buyers that get antique cars.

752
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,200
And that's moving into the new collectors stuff.

753
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,200
Sounds good, but I think it's moving into new bell AB lessons because

754
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,840
the consumer isъ

755
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,080
it's usingratulations, and reasonable,

756
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,680
asiaqpal, or otherwise,

757
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,520
open it up to .jpg

758
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,980
but in this case,

759
00:45:47,980 --> 00:46:01,620
names tanta
