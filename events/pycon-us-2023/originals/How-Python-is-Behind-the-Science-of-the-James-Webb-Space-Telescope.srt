1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
and through intercommunicable activities

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:25,260
the

3
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,880
And that's the way we're going to do it.

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,740
So thank you.

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,240
Thank you.

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:28,740
Thank you.

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,240
Thank you.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:29,740
Thank you.

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,240
Thank you.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,740
Thank you.

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,240
Thank you.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,620
Yeah, thanks for all of you for what you've done.

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,620
And I'm just taking this time to give you a little bit

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,340
of a chance to highlight some of the other jobs

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:41,940
that we've done.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,860
And I'll do that later.

17
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,060
That's the end of the video.

18
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,660
Still one more thing.

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,100
So I'll leave this collection at the end.

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,940
So let me start with some introductions here.

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,400
So I'm a colleague of yours, and just

22
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,520
I'm a colleague of yours.

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,960
Roger's done this for the first time.

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,800
So he's done a couple of things.

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,760
He's done a couple of things.

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,240
So he won the best award.

27
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,360
I'm a colleague of yours.

28
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,440
And I'm going to give you a little bit of a brief report.

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,160
But I'm going to give you a quote that is a little bit

30
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,640
more specific.

31
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,720
One is that those funds that are used

32
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,720
as fund-based funds for the state of New York City

33
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,440
are used to pay for the state of New York City.

34
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,720
But that may not look like something to me.

35
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,880
Don't tell all the friends of this guy

36
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,160
with Tony, I always say something

37
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,720
that works for an institution.

38
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,960
These people are places that can be used

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,920
because it does the intellectual work.

40
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,160
It's a place that's very much like a space,

41
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,800
a great place to be.

42
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,440
And I know it's not a place that's

43
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,080
been used for many years now.

44
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,920
But that's part of the reason why we're

45
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,960
one of the few organizations that has

46
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,080
the financial support of this state.

47
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,800
And it's actually very, very significant to the state

48
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,320
of New York City.

49
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,680
And it's very, very strong in New York.

50
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,720
So to start, if you'd like to hear anything,

51
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,840
I'm going to talk a little bit about the USP,

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,320
or the USP as well as the USP.

53
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,000
So there's no version of it in the public of photo

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,640
videos.

55
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,560
That's not the version of it.

56
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,600
There's no such thing in the media.

57
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,800
But there's no version of it as one of these two cities

58
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,680
that have not been used for a long time.

59
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,000
That's not what we're doing.

60
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,440
That's good to know that one of the things that's

61
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,920
going to be interesting is that it's a video.

62
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,440
But for that, I'm going to be looking

63
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,320
at the films that I'm going to be taking.

64
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,080
So what does it look like to be in the video?

65
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,520
And it's going to be the one that's going to be in the video.

66
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,320
So it is building in the sense that it

67
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,320
is important to keep it ready for the society.

68
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,000
And it's going to be a huge project

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,800
that's going to be physically and mentally relevant.

70
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,160
But it's also going to be a big one in the sense that it's

71
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,880
going to be more of this collaborative work

72
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,240
of moving many people from all walks of life

73
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,840
in a different way.

74
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,240
It's going to be led by things like video games,

75
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,040
video games based in Germany, the games

76
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,680
that are based in Germany.

77
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,480
So it's different in the sense that it's

78
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,080
different in the sense that it's for many different purposes.

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,640
A lot of people don't know this.

80
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,640
The pride of film editing is one of the six tracks.

81
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,800
It's a small part of the thousands

82
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,840
of people that work this way.

83
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,440
So all that remains for the film is it's a work to do.

84
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,560
It's a commitment to what is going to be a big project

85
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,720
that people are going to be able to do in a long time.

86
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,880
There's somebody that's in the sense

87
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,360
that somebody's going to be in this project.

88
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,240
It's also important to be in the sense

89
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,640
that it's not just for the film.

90
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,200
It's not just for the film industry.

91
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,840
It's just for the law firm.

92
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,120
When you say the best thing, the most important concept

93
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,080
for the studio is people are going to be in it.

94
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,680
And that's really the definition of the buildings.

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,000
In some level, it's the buildings that take them.

96
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,280
Not the buildings that take them.

97
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,560
So what we see is this whole image of the structure

98
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,360
is that something's going to be in the work.

99
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,720
This isn't just a building.

100
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,840
This is not the point where it's going to be exactly the way

101
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,000
that we would like it to be.

102
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,200
So I'm not going to spend the whole time talking

103
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,360
about large buildings.

104
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,520
There are different buildings.

105
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,280
But the thing is, there are different ways

106
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,760
that we are going to be building these buildings.

107
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,760
It's not only the size of the building.

108
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,960
This is the way it was like to see the training images.

109
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,800
So first, you have just the general design, which exists.

110
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,400
But it was not just for the film.

111
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,280
And it was really a few very long days for the film

112
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,480
to get to the point where I'm sure there was a ton of things

113
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,240
that were clear.

114
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,360
I'm sure there was a ton of things that were not clear.

115
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,760
And the way it went down was the first thing

116
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,280
that took place was the building itself.

117
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,160
And the reason for this was the building itself.

118
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,760
There was a lot of overlap in the way

119
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,160
that this was going to be supposed to happen.

120
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,240
And actually, it wasn't happening.

121
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,640
And then we were all watching it at that time.

122
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,080
And it was this weird way.

123
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,800
And then there were plenty of film scenes.

124
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,000
And it was clear that the way that it was going to be built

125
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,040
was going to be the film itself.

126
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,680
And how was this issue of it being glorified?

127
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,960
And it was a bit interesting.

128
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,280
This week, we had a very interesting film shoot.

129
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,760
It was very similar to Schum butt experience.

130
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,600
And I had touched pretty much every inch

131
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,080
of the subjects, as I told you earlier,

132
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,000
but it was trying to be more free and different,

133
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,320
and free more towards the end of those violence

134
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,760
forsuper hopefully mite ing.

135
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,120
And it was easily the first thing that of the next director.

136
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,480
It was very free from intersecting

137
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,040
even better with those voice picks and stuff.

138
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,000
And I don't think a power before experience

139
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,480
was one of those things.

140
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,320
that this is one of the most powerful policies in the world,

141
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,240
also in the United States, in the world.

142
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,540
And that's what we're doing.

143
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,240
That's what it was like to have the opportunity to do this.

144
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,360
And I'm sure it is difficult to help begin the time

145
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,400
to make decisions for a certain number of people

146
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,280
in the world who are going to be affected.

147
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,800
Now, let me talk a little bit more about what such a big,

148
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,720
big problem is in the United States.

149
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,440
And it's very important to start with the things

150
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,400
is to be really open to the people that this is really

151
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,080
going to do.

152
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,160
So if you look at the area that we first mentioned,

153
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,640
it's a cluster of galaxies.

154
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,840
So there are some things like, if you wake up,

155
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,120
it's only going to be one.

156
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,680
But it's a fusion of these galaxies in the sun.

157
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,720
So by the way, the first thing is that the star of these things

158
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,000
are a cluster of galaxies.

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,640
And it's the same thing that's happening within the sun.

160
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,920
So that's a good thing.

161
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,320
So there's a lot of other shapes that we can think of right now.

162
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,200
And one of the five other things is

163
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
the probability that the sun is going to be

164
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,560
a big part of the galaxy.

165
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,040
And that's what we're going to see in the problem.

166
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,400
To make sense of what it looks like,

167
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,880
it depends on the problem we can think of.

168
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,320
So I'm going to set this up in a couple of minutes.

169
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,200
So immediately by moving this into the years

170
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,040
to look at the space, we're going to recognize this is

171
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,200
a real sign that things are going to be a bit better

172
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,360
for us.

173
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,160
And it's going to be a bit more scrappy than the one

174
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,560
that we've been avoiding in the United States.

175
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,320
And it's going to be a bit more difficult.

176
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,920
And we probably won't be able to solve it in time.

177
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,000
This is really the first punch that's like, yes,

178
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,200
it's the thing.

179
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,000
And the rain doesn't even know if it's going to be

180
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,160
a possible solution.

181
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,800
So that was one of the things that we

182
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,440
thought was worth it, which is quite the thing.

183
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,160
One thing that we thought was worth it,

184
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
there's the interesting thing is that what you're hearing

185
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,320
really really really gets to us.

186
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,600
To be fair, it really gets to us far away.

187
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
We've got these red things in the face.

188
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,000
And when it's too dark, they don't

189
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,560
get to us because it's just like the earth.

190
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,680
Now, again, progress is going to be quite far away.

191
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,640
The rain is going to be far away.

192
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,680
The point is, we can't even realize

193
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,000
that we're in the front of the storm.

194
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,280
We're doing this because it was going

195
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,360
to be a bit of a surprise to me.

196
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,880
Because those are just the answers to those questions

197
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,960
that we're going to have to think about.

198
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,520
And all that we need to think about is,

199
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,680
is it really just going to be a fast one?

200
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,800
It wasn't so clear to us that it was going to just be

201
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,360
a bad thing.

202
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,120
All right.

203
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,560
To the third line, we're going to talk about the rain.

204
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,040
And they talk a little bit about the predicted rain.

205
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,840
And we'll talk about the trip it's going to be.

206
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,520
And this has to be one of the worst things.

207
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,780
So despite the fact that this thing's great,

208
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,760
what's in the rain is bad.

209
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,360
It's not going to be bad.

210
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,680
It's going to be as bad as we thought it was going to be.

211
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,600
But it's actually going to be good.

212
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,360
But once we know what's going to be just the worst,

213
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,260
then that's what we're going to have to think about.

214
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,080
That's when it turns out.

215
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,400
Those are really the worst things we're going to have to think

216
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:54,880
about.

217
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,880
So I'm going to talk about three different pieces of things.

218
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,040
First, the bad weather.

219
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,120
The bad weather.

220
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,240
The bad weather.

221
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,320
The bad weather.

222
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,360
The bad weather.

223
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,160
The bad weather.

224
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,600
So places where it's going to be worse

225
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,760
than what we're going to have to think about.

226
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,800
And I'm going to talk a bit about the bad weather.

227
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,200
I think a few things are going to be fine.

228
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,360
But we can't do a lot of things for us

229
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,760
from individuals and communities,

230
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,200
specifically when it's going to be worse

231
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,400
than we thought it would be.

232
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,000
Because bad weather is a community-based thing.

233
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,880
So we're going to study this for some of this bad weather.

234
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,760
As it goes on, we're going to consider it as a community.

235
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,120
And the last thing I'll talk a little bit about

236
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,800
is the bad weather.

237
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,760
It's bad, but it's going to be something that's going to be

238
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,520
really bad.

239
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,000
And it's going to be something that's going to be

240
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,720
really bad.

241
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,300
So on a daily, we spend a lot of time

242
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,360
orous time studying this.

243
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,500
But these worst weather.

244
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,880
You don't want to run into this.

245
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,860
That's not a good thing.

246
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,760
We spend a lot of time studying this.

247
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,580
You can't do it.

248
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,860
This case encounter, it's not going

249
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,420
to be a bad weather situation.

250
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,580
It may just be, for example, an accident.

251
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,640
There's a lot of fun different things for it.

252
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,880
So let me start by talking to hurt the heat,

253
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,640
and come up with this whole thing to start with.

254
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,080
So here we're going to be talking about bad weather.

255
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,180
the

256
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,680
mo

257
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,560
the

258
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,760
lo

259
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,460
the

260
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,600
course

261
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:21,120
the

262
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:30,000
on

263
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,540
the

264
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,020
is a very similar thing.

265
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,980
But still, as I've stated this in my translation before,

266
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,060
it's a lot closer to the space of my description

267
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,780
of the use of space than the use of space.

268
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,180
So that's a personal point.

269
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,740
And let me clarify, in those questions,

270
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,580
I'm actually just eventually going

271
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,460
to say that what we do in the field is clear.

272
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,020
And I'm going to answer, because I care about space.

273
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,100
If you reduce space, that's a very simple question.

274
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,500
But what if it's true that space is something that we

275
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,260
totally don't understand?

276
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,660
So that's easy to answer.

277
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,380
So it's not that it all is going to be simple.

278
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,500
It's just that it's not something that we're supposed

279
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,000
to do.

280
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,940
So let me talk a little bit about the reality

281
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,620
of the decisions that we make when we're talking about

282
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,700
what we actually do in space.

283
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,380
So it was a pretty complicated process.

284
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,500
And it was a bit of a spin.

285
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,060
But it came into being in the work

286
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,620
of about the idea of doing this, which is what we tried to do.

287
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,980
And this is because we used the words of knowledge,

288
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,140
and we said that we had the ability to do all things

289
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,380
without having to work with a few different scientific

290
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,540
instruments, other than the four different systems

291
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,820
that were working on the space.

292
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,400
And so a lot of working together, organizing

293
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,900
examples of what we were saying, what we were doing,

294
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,820
and we were doing, to some extent,

295
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,420
was different proportion of the things that we were doing.

296
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,660
And like I said, it was a top level process.

297
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,540
It was a bit like what we were doing in space.

298
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,020
I mean, it was a top-scale task.

299
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,140
Go to the top.

300
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,700
Go to the big three directions.

301
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,380
And this was the only time we did some of the product changes.

302
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,580
The point is that, as I said, when

303
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,340
I was thinking of the things that we were doing,

304
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,720
I was thinking of the things that we were

305
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,580
trying to do in the past.

306
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,180
But in what ways have these systems of analysis

307
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,140
changed, and whether they were actually

308
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,260
spread across the scientific community,

309
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,980
and then what we were doing.

310
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,740
And once we?

311
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,660
So we did a few of the inter-biome vaccines,

312
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,780
also as a type of reference, and we did a few of these.

313
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,020
It's all the different subsets of the inter-biome

314
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,660
that we did in the past.

315
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,860
So this is the end of the quantum research.

316
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,820
It's huge price for just four billion years

317
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,700
of the whole of the universe.

318
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,660
And I don't know if that's what she's talking about,

319
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,820
because it's just a very limited number of factors.

320
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,860
Very well, it is a very limited number of things

321
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,780
that we moved from the data that we spent in the 40s

322
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:47,220
to the data that we have in the 70s and the 40s.

323
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,020
And so let's say that the client is a team of providers

324
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,220
that are going to do this.

325
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,280
We had

326
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,920
to think around where the guy is going to go.

327
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,820
You don't get a test, you look at your bound,

328
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,220
and that's what we were flourishing off

329
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,380
in that time there was this one

330
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,100
where people were actually twice at this point.

331
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,260
You get this guy you're like We're going to rob her

332
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,160
once this guy's gone.

333
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:20,760
Look for NACU official Israel

334
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,060
the medical inspection.

335
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:30,060
small disappointments!

336
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:50,100
So what's you telling me about my

337
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,600
in Europe.

338
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,160
But in propaganda,

339
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,520
from the Communist point of view,

340
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,680
spot00 was that

341
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,140
it was a political logic

342
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,880
that would see any conflict in Europe.

343
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,240
빨āh ahb parts of it

344
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,380
would say that

345
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,060
this new war was going toietnam

346
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,180
still he was in

347
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,800
that they were certain

348
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,080
the second i ran website

349
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
even then

350
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,600
that the political physics

351
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,780
has nuclei

352
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,120
people who have confused

353
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,920
the society

354
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,620
can produce

355
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,140
that 달� Bentley

356
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,740
I think

357
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,940
But the other thing is that the government is this blockbuster that just jumped into the

358
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,320
bridge in front of it, but you know it, there's a lot of risk that the bridge is going to

359
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
collapse.

360
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,220
And that's because some of these people are going to be thinking that this is going to

361
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,580
be a very specific, you know, the whole bunch of them, the whole thing, indeed, that's going

362
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:39,580
to be a very, very common bridge, often, for many people working in the city.

363
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,220
So this helps to expand, you know, the idea of a block, you all can't take any of this

364
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,220
stuff, you know.

365
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:51,220
As we move on to like a more of a pre-point effect, it's clear across all of the individuals

366
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,220
that we've featured in this talk, as the use of the state-owned GFB, we've all tried to

367
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,220
work out this thing.

368
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,220
But it's not just the police officers or the officers of the country that are working

369
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,220
on the bridge.

370
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:11,220
So because the charging industry is effecting all of that core design, so if you use some

371
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:29,200
kind of cy

372
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,960
No, for one, immediately,

373
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,660
we can get faster comments down below

374
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,040
about mainly slaughtered,

375
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,760
but part of the analysis is done

376
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,320
three times a day over and over again.

377
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,540
With light GRP,

378
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,420
similarly, I said before now

379
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,780
that boundless amount of people

380
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,760
didn't have self nectar at the time.

381
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,380
That's kinda of器

382
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,760
you really think all of these 10 principles

383
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,560
And one of the great things is that we have a product

384
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,440
that's more effective.

385
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,400
So that's the idea of the production model.

386
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,800
So that's the main idea of the practice

387
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,320
of producing a production model.

388
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,040
And the other thing is this.

389
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,640
So this puts the idea of the use of this in the production

390
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,720
model.

391
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,000
This is the idea of the galaxy.

392
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,880
So it's a concept of a planet.

393
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,440
A planet.

394
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,600
So you've got a wide galaxy.

395
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,440
You've got this planet.

396
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,000
It's actually known as a digital planet.

397
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And you can actually see this planet,

398
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,120
which, I'll go ahead and say, first would

399
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,960
like to talk a little bit more about its genesis.

400
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
It's supposed to be a planet.

401
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,760
But rather than makingWhoa.

402
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,360
It's supposed to be a planet that invades humanity

403
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,960
and stores human recognition and parameters

404
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,520
each other, but it really becomes a planet

405
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,280
esa which one could think of.

406
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,560
So just wanted to tell you what this is.

407
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,120
Because it actually is a picturesquepmthis

408
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,200
The answer to that last question is questionable numbers

409
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,380
in the between?

410
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,080
But, you could actually figure this out,

411
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,080
and the other.

412
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,480
But each of those works is understood

413
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,040
in the most important way.

414
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,040
So if you look at what I'm going to talk about,

415
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,440
what I'm going to talk about, I'm

416
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,720
going to talk about the way in which all this works.

417
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,800
But there's also, in the past, this

418
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,640
is the way in which things come together.

419
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,840
There's the fact that you can use these things to achieve

420
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,040
something that you don't do.

421
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,080
The fact that you can use all of it just to do something

422
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,440
that you don't do.

423
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,320
And it was now that it became a thing.

424
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,560
And I think it's a real discovery, too.

425
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,480
So there's two or four works, nearly four,

426
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,800
in which I think they are both relatively easy to do.

427
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,160
And the other, who do I think is even better than that?

428
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,100
So there are ways that you can assume

429
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,960
that one that seems like an ability

430
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,960
right now to use the other, fine.

431
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,200
This one just shows me that there's

432
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,960
really one way that for the only possible sort

433
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,500
of interface that you can use and find for the branch.

434
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,440
Because when it comes to small groups next to it,

435
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,760
it's not just five or four, right?

436
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,520
So this is not really one that I would

437
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,840
think is today's most simple simulation.

438
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,240
I mean, besides theודה designs on that?

439
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,740
It's very fast.

440
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,740
It's a very speedy process.

441
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,740
It's very fast.

442
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,740
It's very fast.

443
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,740
It's the awkwardness of new features

444
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,240
that are not available in the current data.

445
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,740
I'm just going to say that for me,

446
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,740
it's not easy to actually win a computer.

447
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,740
I'm not going to do it.

448
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,740
It's hard. What's happening is the collision

449
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,740
between the devices and the software

450
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,740
is just too much for the user

451
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,740
to control and then do that.

452
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,740
Other parts of the database are just much more important.

453
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Probably not easy to get too much of the data

454
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,240
into the computer.

455
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,240
It's too complicated.

456
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,240
This is really the new way that we could do scouting

457
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,240
since we started in 2004.

458
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,240
Now, the problem with the database

459
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
is that it's very easy to get

460
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
problems with the user's ability

461
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
to control the software.

462
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,240
But you can see the other

463
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
is not possible.

464
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,240
In the sense that

465
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
it shows that the only balance

466
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,240
in the software is the way it works.

467
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
So it turns out that it's quite complicated

468
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,740
in this sense.

469
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,740
And one of them is the phased-out

470
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,740
system, which is quite similar to scouting

471
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,740
and it's just a little bit different

472
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,740
to the way it works.

473
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,740
And that's why

474
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,740
you can see all of those three points

475
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,740
are balanced.

476
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,740
Those are all actual stars

477
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,740
and the stars are a small hole

478
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,740
in the way.

479
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,740
And you have to see how the

480
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,740
software is most used in the case

481
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,740
of the database.

482
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,740
It's not possible for them

483
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,740
to resolve the applications of the code

484
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,740
and to resolve the applications of the code.

485
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,740
And so, in this case,

486
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,740
the applications of the code are

487
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,740
all the same.

488
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,740
But the problem is that

489
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,740
the database is not the only one

490
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,740
that's being resolved.

491
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,740
So, if you look at the database,

492
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,740
that's the only one that's being resolved.

493
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,740
It's a very small one.

494
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,740
And that's why it's so difficult

495
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,740
to resolve the applications of the code.

496
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,740
So, we're not able to do that in this case.

497
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,740
So, one way of looking at the database

498
00:18:44,740 --> 00:19:08,240
is really to

499
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
find applications

500
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
where your professional leaders

501
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,280
have to do the supposed

502
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,520
what you're doing with the efficient analysis.

503
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,740
I was told that we could work together to power

504
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,240
the things we felt were too expensive for CocaCola.

505
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,520
And I'll try to convince them why.

506
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,320
And the true analysis was, how basically will

507
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,180
Kota Divine be a zaczyn agora, when it's all

508
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,140
made into the equipment to compete people?

509
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,040
And the reason is old.

510
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,740
It evidence our box and the mores,

511
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,840
but basically all that's left are disandyrellers.

512
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,380
So we're trying to build in a problem and sets

513
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,460
that because only time will grip it.

514
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,460
foaming up through the abducting configure

515
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,380
of the

516
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,620
had found his escape.

517
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,620
alluded to as a

518
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,220
feature in the

519
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,980
jumps 추가

520
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,460
the first of his firsts, and so it's a very difficult

521
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,460
instance to use, because of the fact that the manager

522
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,460
is not the person who's going to take this to the public.

523
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,460
One of the things that this kind of makes is for us

524
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,460
to find solutions to the problem.

525
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,460
There are a lot of things that can be done.

526
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,460
And so it's not just the dogma that's been taught us,

527
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,460
because there's like 47 notebooks, but there's a trial

528
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,460
and trial and attempt to find, and so there's a few

529
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,460
different methods of finding the right way to do that

530
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,460
and so there's a few different methods of finding the right way.

531
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,460
But also, it just comes from the analysis of the case.

532
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,460
So I understand that there's a lot of this sort of

533
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,460
this is a bit of a mix of the five and the six.

534
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,460
It's just because there's a special sense of the

535
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,460
the basic problem that we want, but that's really

536
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,460
a pretty close to the real problem that we're trying to solve.

537
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,460
And the materials that the questioner is going to be

538
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,460
looking at today are the stuff that was used in the

539
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,460
analysis of the case, the problems that we've got,

540
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,460
the things that we've been having to solve,

541
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,460
the things that we've been working on.

542
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,460
And these are the things that we have to focus on,

543
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,460
because it's not a real case, I think, of the

544
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,460
photographic code that we use in the case of the

545
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,460
system, but it's not a real case, and it's a pretty

546
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,460
close case to the real thing, so I think it's a very

547
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,460
close case. It's a very close case, so I think it's a very

548
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,460
close case. It's a very close case. It's a very close case.

549
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,460
It's interesting, but it's close too.

550
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,460
And it's possible. And it depends on just the

551
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,460
exact right tool, so that if you can stick with your

552
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,460
better understanding of the code, and you can

553
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,460
use that to the code, and you can use that to the

554
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:42,460
code, then the results for any event.

555
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,460
So this is a whole front end of an intervention

556
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,580
będzie result. So this is talking about an

557
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,460
interactivity of thisamo, but that's much more

558
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,460
interesting. So this is a whole front end of an

559
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,460
じゃあ some foster of an act for a real case, so

560
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,460
that's pretty close, actually look at this for this

561
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,460
image. And we would very much like, again, I think

562
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,460
훈 fascinating way of thinking about this.

563
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,460
You can use all of this any time you want.

564
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,460
I mean, come back with, let's say, the round

565
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:09,400
other how different a UFO exists compared to us being

566
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,500
頭 sculpture for cars in its way,

567
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
which means more than one thousand times in the United

568
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
States.

569
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,320
Again, literally people then take abait image by

570
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,420
following things other than how decisive they were in

571
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,420
drawing this work and are not known and how it harmonized

572
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,400
with the image they produced, which also Explorders a

573
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,200
reach for us, so let's start by discussing complex

574
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
monitoring.

575
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,500
I'd also like to all keep�for you the time we do

576
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,680
and we're going to be able to do that in the next few weeks.

577
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,260
And so this is a thing where we start to kind of

578
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,980
re-enroll the interstate and support it.

579
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,420
Every time you start to see the interstate,

580
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,840
you see the interstate.

581
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,420
In the context of that, they don't see where that's going.

582
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,780
It's not the future or either.

583
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,820
It's the future or the future.

584
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,660
We're not there.

585
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,500
We're not there yet.

586
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,500
We're not there yet.

587
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,060
And I would like to direct you now

588
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,060
to the point that I was talking about

589
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,540
as part of the first meeting.

590
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,740
In fact, all kinds of new,

591
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,340
certainly specific things that's going on,

592
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,380
but most notable is that the media is just not there,

593
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,500
but we've got to look back and take a look.

594
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,940
I want to direct you to the point that you're processing,

595
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,780
in the words of Frank,

596
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,020
what things are coming up in the media.

597
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,940
And this new is definitely not something

598
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,980
that you've just heard from anybody else.

599
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,200
It's not something that's been discussed or

600
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,980
that we can all go to.

601
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,660
And it's not something that's been worked on,

602
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,100
but we're creating.

603
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,700
You can also start calling it type-based.

604
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,280
Maybe we'll see it sometimes in two designs this year.

605
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,980
I wanted to make a changes and up on February

606
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,980
three, down to three two weeks later,

607
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,580
when I was talking about,

608
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,780
opa happened just last year,

609
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,680
and then this was away,

610
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,740
and when we walked this third week enough,

611
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,100
and then I was talking to Frank this time about,

612
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,820
that one week ago.

613
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,260
So yes, you can keep it going,

614
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,020
until we reach the two weeks lots of things,

615
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,160
is something more practical.

616
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,280
So the first thing that I wrote was

617
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,720
quickly Resolving came to mind.

618
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,540
A couple of success stories that I told,

619
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,040
I won't analyze those, at least not

620
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,060
because in the other pieces, but I

621
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:16,640
interviewed authors, limiting myself to just not

622
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,560
any competition, but I was able to take

623
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,680
on for the first with my sad Austocalypse, which

624
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,520
is about less than 35.

625
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,400
And if you thought that they stolen 50 years ago,

626
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,840
then not with the competions of chore requirement.

627
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,240
but as we move to the special needs,

628
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,080
how do we move from this to that?

629
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,280
How do we do something like this?

630
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,480
Like, is there a problem with the teamwork?

631
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,080
So just keep your eye properly hidden here

632
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,000
in which the actors in the middle of James's room

633
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,960
are just sort of in this way and sort of,

634
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,040
the judges usually like to sit in front of the front row.

635
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,440
And I'm just showing you this hope here

636
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,640
for one of the things that we're doing.

637
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,960
I think there's plenty of things that we're doing

638
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,640
that's on the outside of our service system

639
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,880
and all of the things that we have to do.

640
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,520
And the key point to take away from this

641
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,960
is that we're not that far,

642
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,800
is that right away,

643
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,040
because some of the things that we're doing

644
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,400
is just keeping the front row

645
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,040
as the front row,

646
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,360
and I think it's really great

647
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,200
that we're doing this now

648
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,560
because we're already in the first section of the service.

649
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,640
Now, the two of us,

650
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,880
one is Alex, and the rest of us are in the front row.

651
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,960
The two of us are in the middle of the row.

652
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,560
I'm going to give you a quick tour

653
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,400
of how this is going to be done in this room.

654
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,240
It is so basically,

655
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,080
actually, I'm not going to say that we're going to do it in the back,

656
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,040
because we're going to be doing this in the front row,

657
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,240
but I want somebody to sit in the middle,

658
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,680
and that is responsible.

659
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,400
And that's the key point that we're doing.

660
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,180
So it's basically the truth.

661
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,280
You will see again when we六 of us这样当我们六人都在那边做点什么。

662
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,520
In reality, this is how things go.

663
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,480
That's what we're going to see in the service.

664
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,560
So we're drugs artists with drugs

665
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,140
and we've noticed further

666
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,600
that the kind of inhalation is quite Waar

667
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,560
It's quite light

668
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,800
and wearing Board slippers

669
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,900
is kind of like how

670
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,540
not just the decorative football

671
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,300
but space Like we're going to be giving weight

672
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,440
for probably 40 minutes.

673
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,360
So the joint you hear

674
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,640
is sort of this kind of ayst Gew��

675
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,960
wick, which it looks like

676
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:11,480
which might very well have been tied to the

677
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,320
and become a major part of the private sector,

678
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,920
and the other two major areas of political development

679
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,480
is the effects that are going to affect

680
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,120
a lot of private firms in the US context.

681
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,560
So that's the first thing that we need to consider.

682
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,800
And on top of that, as you see from the right,

683
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,400
even if using the famous price on the border

684
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,480
in the UK, the price on the people

685
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,400
who use the government, which is another thing

686
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,600
that we need to consider, aside from specifically

687
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,360
which is particularly important,

688
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,960
even then it's the question of what

689
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,920
the people think of the government,

690
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,840
even though it's a private sector company,

691
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,840
and how they're going to benefit from it.

692
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,360
So part of why that's important is the place

693
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,280
that we need some of the effects that this community

694
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,200
has created, has been brought in, and has been brought in.

695
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,280
In the significant questions we have to look at

696
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,480
to understand what the problems are in this country.

697
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,160
I believe we do a lot of work, because we're

698
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,720
the first few years to include cultural and political things

699
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,600
in the white and white-white world, as we look at the US

700
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,040
as a whole system for the development model,

701
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,720
which I thought I would just use as a title,

702
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,440
and really write this particular question for you,

703
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,680
because it is the largest of five people

704
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,160
in the US, and it's the first time

705
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,320
that we've heard that the last five years,

706
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,120
some form of a trend of this thing,

707
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,800
is the fundamental general definition

708
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,760
of what is a social movement.

709
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,240
And really, we're also developing these ideas.

710
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,600
So we actually have a very active and innovative

711
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,280
kind of raising hand in the important parts of the trend,

712
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,280
such as the use of these kinds of structures

713
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,120
in the South African country.

714
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,600
But I think that's something we have got

715
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,000
that we can take on the basis of,

716
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,360
and I think it's a key component of the development of the country.

717
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,600
And I think that it's also more like

718
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,720
as much of a state of the art,

719
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,880
but we know this kind of thing,

720
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,600
and it's very striking, the obvious in the project,

721
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,000
and it's not just that, you know,

722
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,280
the lots of the reasons for the thousands of these

723
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,400
acceptable publications that we've set the next year

724
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,840
are for some reason more.

725
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,120
So those people who are active,

726
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,000
those who are quite frequently treated

727
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,480
as a crucial reason for the development.

728
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,320
And on the top of that,

729
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,760
the national 25% of those that are still in the community

730
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,000
are the actual contributors who are involved

731
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,240
in the development of the project.

732
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,240
And on the top of that, I think,

733
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,520
there's a bunch of institutions

734
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,920
that are very important for the development of the project.

735
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,080
In that way, so the idea is that

736
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,400
it is a community of community who are here right now

737
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,280
and are trying to take the government's responsibility

738
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,440
into these common community.

739
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
Which is just good to keep in mind

740
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,640
if there's a bunch of people who are coming from that place

741
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,040
that are not in the communities of community

742
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,760
just to help the communities of community.

743
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,600
So, the liberal community needs to go,

744
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,160
and the original industry has to be checked out.

745
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,400
So, it's the thing we always doubt

746
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,000
to get the 7% of those individuals in the community.

747
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,560
And it's not about the team that we're processing.

748
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,160
So, if I were to leave, if you like,

749
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,200
this process would be different.

750
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,640
But, we need to start to talk about coming together.

751
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,560
Because really, it just takes a lot of different things.

752
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,560
Like, you create the link to this network

753
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,440
where you've fallen out of the system.

754
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,520
And if you look, it's really not the same

755
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,080
towards what it's been like for years.

756
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,520
But this question of who is in the field

757
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,960
is probably more important.

758
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,840
It's not the neighborhood that we have in the community.

759
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,480
It's the community.

760
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,320
And that's not open-sided, it's far-rated,

761
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,840
in the principles of the public community

762
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,000
that you can't get in the way of what it is.

763
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,520
But it's also a function of the public community.

764
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,760
And we're back to that.

765
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,840
We're going to talk about that.

766
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,640
So, I'm going to talk about a few things.

767
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,520
So, we've got the big idea of the JVC.

768
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,080
It's a huge PR force of travel.

769
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,040
It's where all the people who are in the community

770
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,880
are going to be.

771
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,800
And so, it's always very useful.

772
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,800
And it's very useful.

773
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,960
There is another huge thing called the JVC.

774
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,240
And that is the biggest one.

775
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,960
It's called the TAS.

776
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,920
Much, much, much, much more than what it's been

777
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,920
since the beginning of the pandemic.

778
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,360
And we're going to talk about that.

779
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,520
But it seems like it's also a huge and reasonable network.

780
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,040
As is the case for the teachers and the teachers

781
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,000
of the public service network, that it

782
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,040
continues to grow.

783
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,160
But the last point that I want to make is that it's

784
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,920
probably not the most effective network system

785
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,520
that we're talking about.

786
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,120
But we're going to try to use it to transport

787
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,480
all of this data.

788
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,520
And I'm going to show you a couple of examples.

789
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm going to show you a couple of examples.

790
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,840
And I'm going to show you a few slides.

791
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,720
I'm going to show you a couple of slides.

792
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,000
This is a slide, please, with Jim.

793
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,560
This is a slide with questions, and I'm going to show you.

794
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,440
Questions coming through.

795
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,600
Let's get that from Jim.

796
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,100
Go ahead.

797
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,600
Thank you.

798
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,080
Thank you.

799
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,580
Thank you.

800
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,080
Thank you.

801
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,580
Thank you.

802
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,080
Thank you.

803
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,580
Thank you.

804
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,120
Thank you.
