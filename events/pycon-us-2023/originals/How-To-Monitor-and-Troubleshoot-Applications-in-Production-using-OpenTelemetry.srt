1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
How's everything for you?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's good.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's good.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So, I'm going to try to talk about

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
very good experiences with the

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
social media.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
First of all, I think I've been in

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
a lot of social media. And I've tried

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to put into these things the benefits of social media.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Before I do that, I just want to say

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that we are the first five times we've

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
gone through this kind of thing. And it's

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
nice to be able to get a little closer to people

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and put this together and build on our people's

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
experiences.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So, I'm going to start by saying

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
thank you.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Thank you.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So, it's been a very special experience

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that I've been through in this fantastic

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
period of time. And at this moment,

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I've got five different social media

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
experiences that I've been able to put together.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
These are the first numbers. And it's another

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
very special experience. Five years

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
after I came here. And also,

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I was just really, really surprised

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to see my dad and brother, my father,

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and my sisters, well, as the social

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
society as a whole, we've been through

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
that. And for the first time, I've been to

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
this kind of thing. And we just want to be

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
able to do that. And one of the things

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
we do is when I was teaching my son to

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
teach at the school of science

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
in open source, we see

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
his near-fathers.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So, today, we've got a total of six children.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
One of them is a

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
country boy.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And also, a boy who's had a few challenges

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and also, a few difficulties.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And so, I've seen that in the last few years.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And I've been able to teach him

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and I've been able to do it.

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And it's just

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
very good for the kids

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
to spend the time with them.

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
One reason to believe

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
is that if one person

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
is really turning out to stick

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
against the abuse of tradition,

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
it would be such a crime.

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And then, a boy who's had a few

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
challenges, and it is that, it's a good

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
thing. And so, I've been able to

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
do a lot of the same thing about the

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
insular system,

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
insular and sphincter.

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So, when I teach my son to teach

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the outside, he always says,

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
this is the most difficult thing I've ever

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
seen in what's really happening in the

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
sphincter system. So, I've done a few

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
things. If you see this, a person

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
has a sphincter. First, we've got a

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
child who's had a few challenges and

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
a sphincter.

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So, this is the same thing as this, but

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
it's not a sphincter. It's a child who's

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
been abused by the insular system, and

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
the child is free to say it.

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's not just that a child has a sphincter.

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But I think that's what it's always

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
happening to say, you can see the answers,

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and it's always happening to say,

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
the answer is that you can say, you can

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
take us to the inside.

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So, this is the first step, the

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
important question. Can we be

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
used, can that be used in the

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
sphincter system?

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You have 10 seconds left on your

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
screen. What is the next step?

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You need

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
a final first,

87
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
a practice list.

88
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We've got a trial, a testing,

89
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
there's a discrimination strategy, and

90
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I hope we're aware of this. This is the

91
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
final step.

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Try the notes.

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I think that the next step is to

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
avoid this problem, and call me if

95
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
you need something. After I've talked to

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
five of them, I think that we are

97
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
at least two minutes away from the

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
end of the test.

99
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We need to support that

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
break-in unit, which is a rise of

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
5,000 people who have

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
been tested.

103
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And that's not a huge number, it's

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
a huge number of people who have

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
been tested.

106
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And that's not a great

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
number, because

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
the test is close to the end of the

109
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
test.

110
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So, here's a good example of

111
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
what we've been doing so far.

112
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
We've been testing the

113
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
test. It's not very difficult.

114
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's not long, it's not much longer,

115
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and it's easy to get the right answers.

116
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And this is what we're trying to do.

117
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's not a test, it's a test.

118
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
For one, it's basically a

119
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
smaller test that we've been doing.

120
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And two, it's much more serious.

121
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And three, it's basically a smaller

122
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
test that we've been doing. And that's pretty

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
nice. But,

124
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
unfortunately, there are some challenges.

125
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
For one, there are really

126
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
challenges. It's not really

127
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
long, but it's seriously serious.

128
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And it's seriously not something that you can just

129
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
question. And this is a

130
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
little bit of a challenge. So,

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
seriously, this one, you have to have

132
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
a good answer. It could be five minutes, or

133
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
a big question.

134
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So, this test is obviously

135
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
a test that takes five pages

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
in your computer,

137
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and goes to the logs of the previous

138
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
three pages, the individual comments,

139
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and you can find these questions.

140
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So, it's not really a test.

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's not really a test that you can just

142
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
ask, that's a software for

143
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
software systems. So, you

144
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
can ignore the fact that it's a software system.

145
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's a big sweat.

146
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So,

147
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
what is the next step to make this

148
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
business?

149
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What is the next step?

150
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So, what is the next step?

151
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What is the next step?

152
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What is the next step?

153
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What is the next step?

154
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Now, I think the main

155
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
question is three things.

156
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay, we don't have a test.

157
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We don't

158
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
do what is

159
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
expected. I do not

160
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
think that's the answer.

161
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So, we're going to each one

162
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and we're going to focus on the first two questions

163
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
because they are pretty good for this test.

164
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
First, they say

165
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
that this is a test

166
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
that you can answer, i.e. what questions.

167
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And the last also is four questions.

168
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We can ask, I think

169
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
this is a test that you can answer, what items

170
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
are being added in this test?

171
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If you have this particular thing,

172
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
what is the next step to make this test

173
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
a good answer this test?

174
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I think that's the answer to the first questions.

175
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What is the next question?

176
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
A lot. You don't know

177
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
what the second question is, so you don't know

178
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
what the second question is. And then I'll

179
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
answer some more questions.

180
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Why does this test

181
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
have this test?

182
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
First, we

183
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
have to answer a question from the

184
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
questioner. The questioner

185
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
asks, what

186
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
is the next question?

187
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And then I'll answer some more questions.

188
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So, together

189
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
we have to answer

190
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
a questioner's question.

191
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The questioner asks,

192
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
what is the next question?

193
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The questioner says,

194
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I think the questioner is

195
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
the first question.

196
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So, the questioner is the first question.

197
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The next question is, what's happening

198
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
in the second question?

199
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So,

200
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
basically, the next question

201
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
is the second question.

202
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And so far, I think this question

203
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
is the next question.

204
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So, I'll answer

205
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
a questioner's question.

206
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is a very difficult question. It's not

207
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
that it's a difficult question. It's

208
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
that I find it difficult to answer

209
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
because

210
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
sometimes when you answer things

211
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
like computer, нач turning,

212
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
programming operations

213
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
tend to agitate

214
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
those functions

215
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
right in front of you.

216
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And this fifth thing, it's aます spoken

217
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
us finish, is that

218
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
memory vernacular

219
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
is missing in spelling out

220
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
some�.

221
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So,

222
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
you might

223
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
what you might think is

224
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And I think this is interesting.

225
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And I think this is a strong litigation.

226
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm not just a suspect.

227
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm also a vigilante.

228
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And I just want to show that the police,

229
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and you say, your research is in beautiful business,

230
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
you know those things are in the business.

231
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
How will it listen to you?

232
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So I think it's a good question.

233
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I think I'm a good person.

234
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I feel that's what I'd like to ask you.

235
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So let's do this fast and interesting.

236
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So if we look at the world in the business,

237
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
so first of all, an extremely interesting thing.

238
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's the fact that if you have to raise the standard of the business,

239
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
it's this whole effect.

240
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And if I can give a little bit of advice,

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
this is why the function of any way to interact with anything that I say sometimes is true.

242
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So it's a very great question.

243
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So the question is, how do you get to the future of open-source litigation?

244
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So open-source litigation is to use APIs,

245
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and SDKs, to use the actual method of using the product to export litigation.

246
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And it's not an excellent fit to answer one problem.

247
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So we can understand that very differently.

248
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And so we need to also get to the future.

249
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm not going to get to the end of what I said, but please remember that there's no other solution.

250
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Open-source litigation is to use specifically the libraries,

251
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
apps, your applications, and custom-to-use custom-to-use applications.

252
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Why do open-source litigation?

253
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Because it's an open-source litigation.

254
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's a work-based legal application.

255
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's a library of information.

256
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's a work-based legal application, such as the first,

257
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and even the first, to look at the document.

258
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Open-source litigation is a work-based legal application.

259
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So you get to spend some money,

260
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
you get to look at the SDS-95,

261
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you get to look at the Flavius files,

262
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and you get to look at the original files, and that's the thing.

263
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The files are saved in here, and I would like to invite you to use them.

264
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I thought there was this one actually,

265
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and that's where there is a special,

266
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
for safety, space, and you want to end up out to the internet.

267
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It is in the country where you live, which is quite a sight.

268
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm going to give you some leads next,

269
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
so I'm going to be focusing on the data,

270
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and I'm going to be focusing on the data files,

271
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
which is very specific.

272
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
There are two views, two opinions,

273
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and five different things,

274
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and it's one of the two questions.

275
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The first is, is there a difference between the two or something along

276
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
the specific situations?

277
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So, there's four different cases that,

278
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and so there's four different cases that

279
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
that's the reason for the difference.

280
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And I'm going to focus this time on the five different cases

281
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
that I'm going to be thinking of.

282
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The first is the core issue,

283
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
which is the same as the other,

284
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
which is the core issue.

285
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And it's a question that you have to work on to find a solution,

286
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and see what the concepts are,

287
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and see what the method is like,

288
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and then the first question,

289
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
the reason for this, is the district difference.

290
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And this is for our bank,

291
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
these three issues, and the sense of

292
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
throughout the four different libraries, the district difference.

293
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So, we're going to focus on the district difference,

294
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
and this is going to be really interesting to look at.

295
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Now, I want to introduce you to this first thing,

296
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and I'm going to just

297
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
introduce you to the first three responses

298
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
that we have here before we get into the case.

299
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And it's for the one-and-a-half-day

300
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
three-year-old students, three-year-old students,

301
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
who say that they didn't know the problem.

302
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Some are putting it the right way,

303
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
some are putting it the right way,

304
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and it's for the four-year-old students,

305
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and it's for the four-year-old students,

306
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
so this is why I'm using the concept with them.

307
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's that we are going to be doing our research

308
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and creating these three cases for us,

309
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and for others.

310
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So, this is the two-part

311
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
that I'm thinking from the beginning of this.

312
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This book is not about the science

313
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
of the four-year-old students, it's about the district difference.

314
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
As long as it's about the

315
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
science of the education, I don't

316
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
say that the APMS is going to create

317
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the science, but as an item of

318
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
research that we've been sitting in

319
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
very few states together, what's the

320
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
reason for the system failure?

321
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Because the scientific research and the data

322
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
study have the exact same five-second

323
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
information.

324
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So, the APMS is neither a

325
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
distribution of information, it's actually

326
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
a cross-section, a little bit,

327
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
but we get it through.

328
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I hope you understand the sense of what is the data

329
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
that's going to be spread.

330
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So that's the first question I've come up with.

331
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It was the next one, it was the

332
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
next three. So why do we need

333
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
this one in the connective?

334
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So that's what this is, the sort of

335
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
the thing that's going to be sent directly to the

336
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
class.

337
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So, yes, we could do the

338
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
same thing, but we still don't have the

339
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
idea of why we would use the

340
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
same thing, which is not the question.

341
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So, also,

342
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
the important thing today is that we

343
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
must remember what is the important role

344
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
in the acquisition of the research that

345
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
we have to focus on the data

346
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
in order to control the certain

347
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
data sets that we're doing in the news.

348
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So we'll also discuss the acquisition of the

349
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
data, put it on the front page of the

350
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
research discussion, and then we'll go

351
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
back to the front page of the research.

352
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So, the question is,

353
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
how can that be done?

354
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It is a tough question.

355
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It was a very safe use of the

356
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
data to be done.

357
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It was not so easy to

358
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
start thinking that, oh, this is not the

359
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
thing that's going to be sent to the class.

360
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Plus, it is, it is something

361
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
that's very difficult to do. It is not

362
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
the thing that's going to be sent to the class.

363
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It is not the thing that's going to be sent to the class.

364
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So, we need to find out

365
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
what we're doing in the next

366
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
couple of years. We have to do this.

367
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We're not talking to much about

368
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
the data, we're not talking to much about sending

369
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
it to the doctors. If the data

370
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
is not the truth, we need to

371
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
look at the research.

372
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So, what do we have to do to

373
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
do this?

374
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We have to look at

375
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
the data. We have to

376
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
look at the data.

377
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
We have to look at the

378
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
data.

379
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's a classic

380
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,040
philosophy, there is a

381
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,920
tags of whoever 직접

382
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,080
sent data to

383
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,680
the doctor, the clinical

384
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,320
flashlight, they have data on

385
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,340
the suit and they know a lot more

386
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,340
about it.

387
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,340
They know much more about it.

388
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,640
So,

389
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,540
what else?

390
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,540
So attention,

391
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,340
is very important for a

392
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,340
balanced state.

393
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,340
Let's let

394
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,340
ourselves

395
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,340
be aware of

396
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,340
But as I said before, this is a very specific issue of the social advice.

397
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:06,340
So, we need to know that we can step as a team, this is our duty as a group, step by step,

398
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,340
and that we step as a larger company, in a inclusive and effective way.

399
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:16,340
And I want to say that, in the time we've been in, and I'm sorry to say this is a first for me,

400
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,340
and I'm sorry to say this is a first for me, but I'm sorry for saying this is a first for me,

401
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,340
and I'm sorry for saying this is a first for me, but I'm sorry for saying this is a first for me,

402
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:27,340
but I'm sorry for saying this is a first for me.

403
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,340
So, it's a huge process.

404
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,340
So, it's a huge process.

405
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,340
But, you know, that's not the only thing that we need to do,

406
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,340
is to step as a business, as a group step by step.

407
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,340
But in this moment, at our present, it will be a surmise,

408
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,340
and we're not alone, to step at this moment.

409
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,340
and self-administration.

410
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,340
And here, in my last video,

411
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,340
I said that this is a tool

412
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,340
to support food and the food industry.

413
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,340
So, actually, we asked

414
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,340
the experts to think for a while

415
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,340
that there is a risk of a fast

416
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,340
and low-cost food industry in Pakistan.

417
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,340
And they said, I would like to

418
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,340
consider trying to open a food factory

419
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,340
among our advances in food and food industry.

420
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,340
How do you decide?

421
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,340
So, the idea is for Japan

422
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,340
to be a good opportunity

423
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,340
to invest in service in Pakistan.

424
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,340
There are so many other issues

425
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,340
that need to be resolved

426
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,340
in order to get the needed financial assistance.

427
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,340
And the problem is that it has to be different.

428
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,340
But the real reason is that

429
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,340
it's very difficult to

430
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,340
want to be a coach

431
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,340
and it's not easy to get the right

432
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,340
support for the service in Pakistan.

433
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,340
It's not easy.

434
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,340
It's very difficult.

435
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,340
It's not easy to get the right support

436
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,340
for the service in Pakistan.

437
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,340
And the future is

438
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,340
in the course of the food industry,

439
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,340
there's less to feed

440
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,340
and it's far less likely to fail.

441
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,340
But that's true

442
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,340
because if you have less money,

443
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,340
the reason for the just-in-service

444
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,340
in the country is that you're not able to get

445
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,340
enough to less than five

446
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,340
months to feed.

447
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,340
So, we're doing this in Germany,

448
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,340
but the benefit is that in Germany

449
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,340
there's less than five months to feed.

450
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,340
So, it's really a problem.

451
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,340
Not really.

452
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,340
But you're the leader of the

453
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,340
industry, so that's a very good

454
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,340
problem. And the most important

455
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,340
thing is that it's not so much

456
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,340
for them to do, but it's for people

457
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,340
to get the needed support.

458
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,340
So, it's not a problem.

459
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,340
It's not a way of bringing up the picture

460
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,340
that's not so much a need for the people to get the support.

461
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,340
So, that's the problem.

462
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,340
What I can do is that I want to

463
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,340
make a difference in the future. So, if I make

464
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,340
a changed측ent deserved access to

465
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,340
feedback, it's not because

466
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,340
a policy was made in prices.

467
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,340
Don't ask yourself,

468
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,340
firemen, what do I really want to do?

469
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,760
Well what I really want is to

470
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,340
then find that, well, part of the

471
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,340
obvious problem that's never been learned

472
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,340
has been that people told themselves

473
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,340
the third way of driving

474
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,340
is to go out of the way of even

475
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,340
showing their products and the

476
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,340
service that we represent,

477
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,340
which is no point

478
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,340
What is it? It's a mission.

479
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,340
What is that mission?

480
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,340
We don't follow missions.

481
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,340
We don't follow the issues to the social.

482
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,340
The issues for trees, the issues for a tree,

483
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,340
it's a fact that this is cyber-deficit.

484
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,340
So we just have to answer that question.

485
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,340
Our ambassador, and he's ready for this question,

486
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,340
he's ready for this question,

487
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,340
because I can take this question,

488
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,340
and say, you're right, it's a social issue.

489
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,340
Now there are many ways in which

490
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,340
we can address this problem.

491
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,340
And that is, we have to do the mission.

492
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,340
And I'm going to show you three other problems.

493
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,340
Here there is the first one,

494
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,340
and that's the one that should be seen in the presentation.

495
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,340
And so, there is the second one,

496
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,340
and that's the one that should be realized,

497
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,340
and that's very useful for everyone.

498
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,340
And the third one is the one that should be

499
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,340
for the class of the government.

500
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,340
And it should be a good thing

501
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,340
for the absolute public policy.

502
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,340
It helps consumers.

503
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,340
And so, that is the real solution.

504
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,340
Full of that, the solution,

505
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,340
all of our capabilities are really

506
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,340
like the service that I've been able to

507
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,340
design and apply to the other things

508
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,340
that we use, and it's not much more.

509
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,340
So I'm going to show you three tools

510
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,340
that are useful for this solution.

511
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,340
This is a small event, just for the very simple.

512
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,340
So this one is about the climate and the emissions.

513
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,340
Here's our resonance, and this is what we've got left.

514
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,340
I want to thank you for all the solutions

515
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,340
to this issue, which we've been able to do,

516
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,340
to our amazing team, and thank you very much.

517
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,340
Thank you.

518
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,340
I think this was a really good conversation.

519
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,340
Thank you.

520
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,340
Awesome. Thank you.

521
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,340
Thank you.

522
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,340
Thank you.

523
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,340
Thank you.

524
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,340
Thank you.

525
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,340
Thank you.

526
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,340
Thank you.

527
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,340
Thank you for that super question.

528
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,340
I'm going to ask you something very interesting.

529
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,340
And it's really very close.

530
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,340
First of all, before this, the very first

531
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,340
thing that you do when you have a question,

532
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,340
I think that, I suggest you guys do a question.

533
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,340
But when you guys have a question,

534
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,340
you need to change your bifurcate,

535
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,340
the soil that you're using.

536
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,340
It's a bifurcate, and it's the only solution

537
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,340
that you use.

538
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,340
It's a service that's self-sufficient

539
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,340
and it's not just a service that's self-sufficient.

540
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,340
It's all those things that you find that

541
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,340
are state-of-the-art, and so that it's a service

542
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,340
that doesn't include any kind of a replication.

543
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,340
That's a good point.

544
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,340
Thank you.

545
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,340
Thank you.

546
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,340
This is a close question.

547
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,340
Have you used the answers?

548
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,340
No.

549
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,340
I'm not going to answer this, but I'm going to say

550
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,340
both of you say something else.

551
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,340
So, the first question is,

552
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,340
so, you were doing a bit of a speedy

553
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,340
sort of thing, and you're going to do that,

554
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,340
so I'll just go through that.

555
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,340
So, the first question is,

556
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,340
so, you are using a different sort of

557
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,340
a bit of a self-sufficient service

558
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,340
that you're using, and I'm going to say

559
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,340
that's a service that you're using,

560
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,340
and you're going to use a different sort of

561
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,540
service that you're using.

562
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:01,340
So this means that actually señ ol

563
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,340
and so forth, and you can actually do that

564
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,340
specifically before and after

565
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,340
your tallEh螢 get a good support.

566
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:15,560
?

567
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,660
this

568
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:51,680
I think the changing of this Maharajasana, this country you have looked to defy like

569
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,680
and what's happening is that's the brain that's producing this information.

570
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,680
And if you find a solution, you will see that you can find that.

571
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,680
This is a quick one.

572
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,680
So there's a difference in the answer to this question.

573
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,680
This is a very specific question.

574
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,680
There's a positive and a negative answer.

575
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,680
So basically, the fact that you have two or three of the subsystems related,

576
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:24,680
the other two reasons set those spaces so different from the both of the systems that we know that we're using.

577
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,680
But because the entire divisor system,

578
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,680
they feel that it's less possible to detect, you want to have this one control of the system.

579
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,680
In effect, it wants to be done in a sub-key of sub-way.

580
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:42,680
And so you want to add in some matrices, so it doesn't write down something that's not there in the system.

581
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,680
So basically, the words that are selected in the both of the matrices look like the same truth.

582
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,680
Next question.

583
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,680
So what are the subsystems?

584
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,680
So, is this a specific case or is that a specific answer?

585
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,680
That is the answer to that question.

586
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,680
Yes, you don't have to answer the question.

587
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,680
This is a very easy question.

588
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,680
It's a very simple question.

589
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
It's a simple question.

590
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,680
And that's the answer.

591
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
Yes, sir.

592
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,680
So, it depends on the first position of the question.

593
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,680
The first position of the system.

594
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,680
It depends on the first position.

595
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,680
And the question, the first one is,

596
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,680
is that the answer can be interpreted as this very simple answer.

597
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
And the answer for those examples.

598
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,680
And the answer for that simple question is,

599
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,680
actually, the first answer for the first one is that the answer does not have a different answer.

600
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,680
And if it's a specific answer,

601
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,680
then the answer has to be this very simple answer.

602
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,680
Yes, sir.

603
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,680
Very nice.

604
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
Okay.

605
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,680
One more answer.

606
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,680
So, that's the answer.

607
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
Thank you very much.
