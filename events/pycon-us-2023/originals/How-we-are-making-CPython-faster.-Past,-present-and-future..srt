1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,060
communication session, from semantics to quantum functions,

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:25,860
the

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,500
So we want to use what we web beaten,

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,860
which means we can work to target

5
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:45,900
at least 15% less of the Interviewer registration

6
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,540
than we have as a country.

7
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,300
OK, we got to do it.

8
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,980
So this is something I've been thinking

9
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,520
about for a quite awhile.

10
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,800
So yes, it's a funny example of how I started to research the

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,400
financial tools that I use, but I'm actually faster than

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,280
any of you, so I'm not going to skip this part.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,320
So you know why?

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,360
I don't know.

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,600
Before I go into making things faster, I actually want you

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,960
to stop thinking that fast and put it in a particular

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,440
terms that's far from right.

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,920
So I'm actually going to do this by case by case.

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,960
So just to tell you how you can find a good job at banks with

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,360
the best paper types on these products.

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,920
So, how fast are they?

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,080
How fast?

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,640
As you know, the harder to make a good market market

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,520
is five times as fast.

25
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,000
So you might think that's a bit too much to just see.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,040
Isn't it too much to find that you need a better

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,960
and faster response?

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,440
Because after the effort, you're going to have to be able

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,800
to do something with it.

30
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,960
Or it's like a bit of a pain.

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,160
So actually, that leads to something that's really hard.

32
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,720
How do you achieve more product times?

33
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,640
Just as you can see, to bring back to the basics,

34
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,720
is a more expensive product.

35
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,680
This, for example, you have to come up with a better

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,840
response, which is why you can see that you might

37
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,520
need to make a product that's not even that much

38
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,600
expensive.

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,480
But you might need to make a product that's not even that

40
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,680
much expensive.

41
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,160
But that's a different, it's actually a better,

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,440
exactly the same product.

43
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,160
You see that they've set the price tag, the product

44
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,640
tag, as well.

45
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,720
But the terms are the same product.

46
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,640
So you have to be able to find a faster response.

47
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,000
How to find a faster response?

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,360
So we need to get the best product that's

49
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,480
going to be the best product.

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,200
So you might need to look at it in a different way.

51
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,080
V8 is for the box of JavaScript, which is just

52
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,000
the 20% of the box.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
V8 is for the box of JavaScript, which is the 20%.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,040
And that's a pretty good product.

55
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,600
So this is a good product.

56
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,320
You can actually get a good product that's

57
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,680
about a 30% more speed than the V8.

58
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,520
It's a good product.

59
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,880
You can actually get a good product.

60
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,440
And that's the best product.

61
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,480
And then you could do a place where you can get a product

62
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,160
that's not even that much faster.

63
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,720
So you could get a faster response.

64
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,520
So you can actually get a faster response.

65
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,080
And that's the two other things that you can get.

66
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,200
So you can get a faster response.

67
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
You can get a faster response.

68
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,640
You can get a faster response.

69
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,320
So where is the time to spend?

70
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,400
The other thing is something that you can do in a different

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,080
way.

72
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,640
You know, maybe that's a great experience.

73
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,840
In fact, in the 20s, there's the concept

74
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,600
of a 20-minute time limit.

75
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
But we start with a good-bye picture.

76
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,280
And then we start to think about what is the right time.

77
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,240
And you start to think about what is the right time.

78
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,680
And that's actually something that's

79
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,440
very interesting, which I've never

80
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,280
heard of in the extreme context.

81
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,080
But it's not actually impossible.

82
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,240
You're definitely going to start to think about what

83
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,880
job it is.

84
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,840
And you need to know that the right time limit

85
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,320
is to spend a 30-minute time limit.

86
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,520
So many times, some of the things

87
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,480
that you can talk about in a larger context,

88
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,640
some of them could be about how to get this point

89
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,560
to a very fine point in your experience.

90
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,400
So we can talk about how to get into the right time.

91
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,560
It's kind of like a time limit.

92
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,320
It's one of those four things that I just

93
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,680
assume that's going to be a good one.

94
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,400
Or maybe it's going to be a good one.

95
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,920
Maybe it's going to be a good one.

96
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,280
But you're going to start to think about what

97
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,120
is the chance of getting this point.

98
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,680
So it's like a garbage work time.

99
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,920
You've got this reference time.

100
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,880
So that's not like the time you've got this time.

101
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,200
But it's one door to the door.

102
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,360
And this part is the end.

103
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,720
That's the end.

104
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,200
It's the end that you can use.

105
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,800
The next thing you can do is find a time

106
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,320
to use for where the first thing you

107
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,680
want to do is to base it on what's

108
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,600
going on in the next day.

109
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,280
So you discuss what time you want to use.

110
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,400
How long?

111
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,920
And then you think about what time you want to use.

112
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,320
And you think about where you want to use it.

113
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,720
So what the right way is to take your way straight.

114
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,320
So you can take your way to the house.

115
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,920
You can take your way to the house.

116
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,960
So that's a bunch of things.

117
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,280
So what is the problem with using a box

118
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,880
for when you're covering this type of thing?

119
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
Because it's just the same thing.

120
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,120
And when it's going, it's like this is

121
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,400
going more than 12 days a week.

122
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,360
It's a great idea to have a break.

123
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,920
Maybe you haven't been there in a month.

124
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,960
It's not a problem.

125
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,520
So you're going to go out to get your break.

126
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,960
You're going to use 20 minutes of this program.

127
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,720
So I would say that this is a nice way

128
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,040
to really get your break done.

129
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,240
So that's the difference.

130
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,880
This is a huge challenge for us.

131
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,160
We're going to use it for years.

132
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,680
This is going to be an economy because it

133
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,600
is going to be a big problem.

134
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,880
The problem with using a box for a break

135
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,400
is that that's where you're going to have some

136
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,880
of the problems that you're going to have to deal with.

137
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,680
And that's probably something that we're going to have to fix.

138
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,320
So I would think that if you're going to have to do something

139
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,480
else in your life, you're going to have one side of the problem

140
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,400
to fix something that you're going to have to deal with.

141
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,640
So it's a rewarding thing to do something like that.

142
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,600
Make money in speculations.

143
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,080
Speculation is one of the many things you're expected to do.

144
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,280
But you can get this about the future.

145
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,760
And I think that's a fast way to do it.

146
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,720
The hardware, for instance, is a bit harder to garage

147
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,880
and you're going to have to use a speculatory, which

148
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,400
will take a lot of time to do.

149
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,960
So you can make a fast move.

150
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,760
And that's by some fast ideas.

151
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,600
We can do some nice things.

152
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,200
But what we have to do is we have to think about

153
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,680
three things that we can do.

154
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,400
At one piece of content, we can work on the same things.

155
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,800
So you can do a lot of things at the same time.

156
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,440
You can do a lot of things at the same time.

157
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,240
It's a pretty hard thing that we have to do.

158
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,240
The last thing is to do a lot of stuff quickly.

159
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,400
But how do we do that?

160
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,040
So the idea is, the last is probably

161
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,160
a couple of weeks, maybe a few weeks,

162
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,200
and then three weeks, maybe four weeks.

163
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,080
Then we have to start with something that we do.

164
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,520
I'm just telling you this because it's so fast.

165
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,680
So we're going to start doing this in a few weeks.

166
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,880
We're going to start to try to get a bunch of things.

167
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,440
So we have to do a lot of things quickly.

168
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,480
And then we have to get the content faster.

169
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,040
Maybe we can do a little bit of everything

170
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,600
and then we can work on these things in a few weeks.

171
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,680
So we're going to start to think about

172
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,880
how we're going to set the pace for the two weeks.

173
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,080
So we're going to start with the main things.

174
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,600
We start with the main things.

175
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,200
So this is probably one of the tasks

176
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,280
that presents the future.

177
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,000
This is going to be one of the things

178
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,840
that we did last week, and we're going to do this

179
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,400
for the next week.

180
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,200
There's a very simple task that we're actually

181
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,160
going to do is we're going to do three weeks,

182
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,520
which is what we're going to do today.

183
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,120
And that's going to be the last thing that we're going to do.

184
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,160
And we're going to start at which point

185
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,600
the package sing is supposed to be working.

186
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,800
And then we follow that package through the same freeze

187
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,060
and how it's working.

188
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,440
So that is how we finish our two to three weeks of Friday.

189
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,080
So that's our fives and quarters week ultra-long Rangeincoln

190
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,760
Maybe it's first two weeks away from us.

191
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,200
So it's not free, too, the first two or three weeks

192
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,720
in a year means yeah, there's быть a pretty small

193
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,840
that's not really like the.]

194
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,040
So I think we all know these two big fan categories.

195
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,640
os estadio, diu x tiresис eh вижу antes and I get edgy.

196

198
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:49,940
And now you should watch returning

199
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:58,040
to your ja 해요

200
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,460
At the secure

201
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,780
all departments to make irreversible changes.

202
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,100
Now, I think it's well worth saying

203
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,600
that, compared with the rest of it,

204
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,100
perhaps the main приг shaped into one's

205
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,060
because that is cast by New Showers.

206
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,580
So we allow that class as a family exists,

207
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,900
and the class takes two years to apply to the students

208
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,180
at 21 queues.

209
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,500
So eventually, it was bricknoticed

210
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,860
to all of course the way to the class,

211
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,720
so this new life that is tasted, is dedicated

212
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,260
in principle to you all from the heart of that event.

213
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,460
It is about to be left in the process of being able to develop

214
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,460
a path with the components of this project.

215
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,460
The next step is that we use the other stuff that we have adapted.

216
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,460
So, in the end, we need to actually ask the guys,

217
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,460
if we can expand the project,

218
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,460
and if we can actually see the improvements that we've made,

219
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,460
there are no other options.

220
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,460
So, it might be a good idea to do a little bit of research.

221
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,460
So, we're not going to do too much research,

222
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,460
but it's going to be a great opportunity to actually do a little bit of research.

223
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,460
So, if you notice there, there's no way for us to adopt this type of project,

224
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,460
because the next type of project will be a construction project,

225
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,460
which is a very interesting statement.

226
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,460
So, if we want to stick it to that concept of construction,

227
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,460
then the contact is going to be very small.

228
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,460
So, it's just one presentation,

229
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,460
but I think it's going to be able to do a lot of research.

230
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,460
So, it's going to be a space that we're going to be able to do research.

231
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:31,460
So, when you click right, it's going to be a project that's going to be able to do the first phase.

232
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,460
And that's because, in the final stage,

233
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,460
we're going to be able to do a lot of research.

234
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,460
So, if you've got something and you look up,

235
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,460
then it's just a project that you're going to be able to do.

236
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,460
So, that's the end of our presentation.

237
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,460
There's a couple of slides that I want to show you guys.

238
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,460
The first one is the initials.

239
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,460
So, first of all, we're going to be able to do a little bit of research.

240
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,460
So, you get one of the things that's going to be on the next slide.

241
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,460
Annual went into apple bureaucraties.

242
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,460
They did this in 2000, and some of the things go back to their generations.

243
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,460
So, people are just going to be some gesch dove,

244
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,460
so..

245
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,460
And don't worry.

246
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,060
Go ahead and don't worry today,

247
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,460
or during the update.

248
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,460
Because what we're going to do compared to when 2,000 were first published,

249
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,460
is we're going to talk about the future of slurs and slurs�ials.

250
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,460
And what the忠 humanists need to do today is to go and do some research,

251
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,460
some fundamental research.

252
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,100
So most of you out there, you're supposed to go from beef to beef or meat better to safe food.

253
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,420
As I mentioned, safety IN vaisse from the country that you're supposed to go from in to meat.

254
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,780
That's just what screws me up!

255
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:40,980
A year ago, for example, when I was a top student inuuuuuu When I was a top student at St bio I went from beef to safe food.

256
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,500
So we are excited, if we can catch the phenomenal onu smart.

257
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,060
Wewear the stacumph boots for the coolest students.

258
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,300
The sc facilit is how to wear the recent shiny coat.

259
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,300
So, we're like, we're trapped in a place that's empty.

260
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,300
So, if the first step is to look at the environment,

261
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,300
the two worlds is the experiment that's happening.

262
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,300
So, once we've set the limits, we're trying to see if everything's okay.

263
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,300
So, instead of looking at the environment, we're trying to see if it's okay.

264
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,300
So, what we can do is we can evaluate the nature of the factors that are going to be used to

265
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,300
determine whether something is going to be used in the next few years,

266
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,300
and if it's going to be used in the next few years, we can look at the results.

267
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,300
So, what we have to do is we have to make things right.

268
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,300
We're going to be doing this through the actions that we've worked with

269
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,300
to decide whether we're going to use them in the next few years.

270
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,300
So, this thing is being done through the ways that we're going to be doing it in the next few years,

271
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,300
so it starts getting more and more consistent with the results,

272
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,300
and it will correct any technical errors that we've made in the first place,

273
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,300
but it's also going to be more complicated.

274
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,300
So, we're going to be doing the next step, which is to make certain that we're doing the next step,

275
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,300
because that is actually a step that we've made in the past few years,

276
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,300
and that's going to be the way we're going to be doing it in the future,

277
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,300
but we're also going to be doing it in the next few years.

278
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,300
And that way, it's going to be more and more consistent with the results.

279
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:57,300
So, we're going to be doing the next step, which is to make things right.

280
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,300
So, just to recap, some time ago,

281
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,300
we were talking about the things that we're going to be doing in the next few years.

282
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,300
The things that we're going to be doing in the next few years.

283
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,300
We have a gist of what that looks like in five to seven years.

284
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,300
So, it was actually can pauver, pursuing these things around,

285
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,300
the five to seven to five, but we tend to move them to that,

286
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:20,320
that's the

287
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,300
So first, I talk about axis 7.

288
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,300
鬥is landed in 50, pictures 5.

289
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:35,300
And partially the sloping policies regardless of our policy lead,

290
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,300
So I think it's a really nice question.

291
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,300
I talked in my work in Japan,

292
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,300
she crossed the line, she was talking about it,

293
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,300
but she's right.

294
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,300
I think it's a really nice question.

295
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,300
And it's nice that I think that's the thing.

296
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,300
So I think it's a really nice question.

297
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
I think it's a really nice question.

298
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,300
It's a really nice question.

299
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,300
Thank you.

300
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,300
So that's the idea of the memory.

301
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,300
So we're going to have a question,

302
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,300
so we're going to have a question.

303
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,300
Now, the other thing I want to go through

304
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,760
is the psychology side very.

305
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,300
Neutron Graz is the way you know

306
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,300
is the three contains 이거는 to see partly

307
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,300
the letter Mercedes from earlier in time.

308
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
Seriously, it's a backwards spectrum bathroom.

309
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
And then the first time I think

310
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
is about how it's supposed to be going��

311
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,300
in the future.

312
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:31,180
There are high

313
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,460
So this line comes out to work with what

314
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,660
can be the most problematic, which is the display.

315
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,780
And then we can't solve this problem just by using the screen.

316
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,180
It's a chemical effect.

317
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,540
So it's a reasonable work and it's not a problem.

318
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,380
But unfortunately, we need something

319
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,380
that is more difficult to do than that thing.

320
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,900
And that's what we're going to use this for.

321
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,540
So the problem is we're not going to be able to do much

322
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,460
to keep this in the equation.

323
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,780
And we're going to use what's called

324
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,340
a chemical effect of the distribution.

325
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,580
So chemical effects are the things

326
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,900
we want to get rid of.

327
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,540
And frictional effects are the effects of the distribution.

328
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,780
So you can call that the best of the world of change.

329
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,300
In the parts of the vector, you can

330
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,260
have a vector of strength that's going to be reduced

331
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,340
and that's going to exist in the same way.

332
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,740
And you can have some other things that are used.

333
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,940
You can have some other things that are used.

334
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,460
And that's going to be a very, very good vector.

335
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,420
And you can have that quality of the vector that's

336
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,020
going to be reduced.

337
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,620
And that's the play.

338
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,140
So frictional effects are the things

339
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,060
that we're going to use this for today.

340
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,660
So we mentioned that not all warfers

341
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,100
are made up of nuclear reparations that we

342
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,420
would see in the recruitment system.

343
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,500
In fact, we known that the focus from the front end

344
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,060
is combлатization on chemical effects.

345
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,380
That is actually not deserves to be there.

346
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,460
It's to react to the effect 20 times

347
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,340
of the impact of the test.

348
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,500
So if you take a look at it, for example,

349
00:14:50,500 --> 00:15:02,880
and concur the Court's decision to adopt the Madame Collis

350
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:16,420
which is that sort of thing—

351
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,420
which states that they are changing the way we work.

352
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,420
That's what we're going to see here in this video.

353
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,420
And so we're going to see how those are

354
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,420
the questions that I was talking about today.

355
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,420
So let's take a look at them.

356
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,420
So I first, this is what the film was.

357
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,420
There's a bunch of people in this film

358
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,420
that are actually getting into the movie.

359
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,420
So it's basically what I said in the beginning.

360
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,420
So that's the second story for the movie,

361
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,420
which is the film that I think I mentioned

362
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,420
in the last video.

363
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,420
So we must come back to the American case

364
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,420
and look at the questions that I mentioned in the beginning.

365
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,420
So you'll be watching this on the right.

366
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,420
I'm just going to speak for those that are in the video.

367
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,420
I'm going to speak for those that are in the video.

368
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,420
So you can see that.

369
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,420
And as you watch the next one,

370
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,420
you'll see that it's the same way.

371
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,420
But I'm going to talk about the other movies

372
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,420
that I've mentioned in the first part of this video.

373
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,420
But I'm going to talk about the movie that I mentioned in the first part.

374
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,420
So let's look at the questions.

375
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,420
So the future is a quite large and very interesting

376
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,420
and very difficult one.

377
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,420
So obviously, the world might change

378
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,420
in a much smaller way than it did in the first place

379
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,420
in the last movie.

380
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,420
So I'm going to speak for those that are in the movie.

381
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,420
So all the parts of our movie

382
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,420
are actually very different from the other movies.

383
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,420
So here's some examples.

384
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,420
And I think I'll just make a little bit of a summary

385
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,420
of the different things that we've discussed

386
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,420
in the last movie.

387
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,420
So here's another example.

388
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,420
So I'm talking about the same old film

389
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,420
that I mentioned in the first part.

390
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,420
So it's a film from the 19th century.

391
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,420
It's a film that I've talked about a little bit

392
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,420
in the movie about the war of the 20th century.

393
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,420
And I'm going to speak for those that have been in it.

394
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,420
So the movie is a very interesting film.

395
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,420
It's a very interesting film.

396
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,420
So the movie starts with a scene

397
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,420
in which the soldier gets killed in the train wreck.

398
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,420
And it's not the movie that's going to be in the movie

399
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,420
in the 20th century.

400
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,420
It's a train wreck, but it's a movie that's going to be in the movie.

401
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,420
So it's a very interesting movie.

402
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,420
The guy comes in the movie with no access to the stuff.

403
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,420
He's walking to the stuff.

404
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,420
We have them together.

405
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,420
The guy comes out of the stuff.

406
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,420
And he's in the train wreck.

407
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,420
And he develops this, the car, the movie.

408
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,420
I could bring you a different image

409
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,420
of a young soldier getting into the next thing

410
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,420
he sees in a police car.

411
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,420
He was arrived at the rifleman's office

412
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,420
just looking for a Crook.

413
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,420
And there were shots of character cars.

414
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,420
And then he wings his Bismarck for the Broad Council

415
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,420
and drew his mustangs.

416
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,420
So you know, it wasn't something all this time

417
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:40,020
when he was in the police cord umas [? 꿈

418
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:54,760
The

419
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:02,680
ance

420
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:08,880
And

421
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
is a very effective way to do this.

422
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
It's a very effective way to do this.

423
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,880
It's a very effective way to do this.

424
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
It's a very effective way to do this.

425
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
In your mind, you're setting up a

426
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,880
word that you're going to follow,

427
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,880
with a word that you're going to follow,

428
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,880
and we will talk about this in the next

429
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
case, if that was true.

430
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,880
And I think that's a great thing to consider

431
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,880
if that's something you need to come up with

432
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
in your mind.

433
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
As I say, the data system is a

434
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
special element of the system.

435
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
And it's not just a word, it's a

436
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
very important element in this space.

437
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
It's a priori to the space, and it

438
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,880
is a very effective way to do this.

439
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
And the first thing to look at is

440
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
where you check the space of the

441
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
database, and you need to have a

442
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
great introduction of the

443
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
checkpoints that you need to have in your system.

444
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
So that's special

445
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
element of the data system.

446
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
And the main thing is that the

447
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,880
database is a very important element

448
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
of the system. Part of the value of the

449
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
database component, N good for

450
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:27,120
Remember, for commit a

451
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,660
差, there is the benefit of card

452
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,660
component index tore form that

453
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,660
is set to self development and

454
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,060
and you're going to be able to do that.

455
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,500
Instead of looking at this with an eye

456
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,960
to such a communication, we're going

457
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,140
to look at what we're going to do.

458
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,180
Even especially if you're involved in the creative work,

459
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,100
generally speaking, you're going to be so incredibly effective.

460
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,340
So lastly, we're going to look at the impact.

461
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,180
So we're going to look at this graph

462
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,580
that shows up in the screen.

463
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,540
So we're going to look at the interaction

464
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,900
process of some of the things that you're working on.

465
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,060
So this is a graphic of the results.

466
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,460
We're going to change the way that you're working.

467
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,900
So we're going to generate a new graph

468
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,460
that's coming to you in the next few weeks.

469
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,180
Now because of the time constraint,

470
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,980
we have to just expect that next year,

471
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,380
we're going to be able to do a simple sketch,

472
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,380
show you some of the things that you're doing.

473
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,420
We'll have got my numbers, and then we'll

474
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,820
have fixed them in some way, and we'll

475
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,140
have a little bit of work to do with that.

476
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,940
So we're going to talk a little bit about the human race.

477
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,940
We're going to be trying to paint up the reference

478
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,940
in some way that's typically so much better.

479
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,820
We're going to be trying to look at the value of the window

480
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,400
which represents the value of this mapping.

481
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,320
So the unit process level where you're

482
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,580
going to see this is roughly shown

483
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,560
in the frame, we're here to illustrate

484
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,820
that this is originally a metric shape,

485
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,180
which混 Province has 4,5 and this is 3,4.

486
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,980
And what is available is the 0.8,

487
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,020
to divide those allowed from the input.

488
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,960
I mean, all of our approaches are in the network.

489
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,380
So we might say, well, the second one

490
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,880
we're going to take is the one that's

491
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,340
a bit more complicated, but I'm going

492
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,780
to take this one, we know that one of the things that we need

493
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,580
to check out is the way in which we're

494
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,780
going to check the data in other ways.

495
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,300
So we're actually going to do a fairly important thing here

496
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,700
in the way that we're going to do this,

497
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,220
and I'm going to explain it to you.

498
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,780
And actually, I'm going to show you.

499
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,700
So I'm going to take the very fast instruction

500
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,820
explanation that we have for this particular example.

501
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,580
Well, because we need to change trends in many ways.

502
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,460
So we need to be able to do that in a way that's

503
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,300
going to be a little bit more sophisticated

504
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,860
and more relevant.

505
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,420
So there's a way to do it really quickly

506
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,060
with the things that we're going to do

507
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,020
that we're going to do in other ways.

508
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,740
And we're doing that in a way that we're going to do it.

509
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,140
Now, we're going to talk about the fact

510
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,660
that we're going to be in the same process

511
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,820
as the other ones, which is the right thing.

512
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,460
Because the real thing is the fact

513
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,620
that we're going to be something that we're going to be doing

514
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,820
in the same way that we're going to be doing in other ways.

515
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,620
And so we're going to be doing a little bit of that,

516
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,100
and then finally we're going to be doing

517
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,740
something that's better and something

518
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,940
that's more relevant than the other ones.

519
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,840
So we are going to start doing the work that we

520
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,180
were going to do to make it a little bit more complicated

521
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,060
for you to just understand it better.

522
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,860
If we get to the end of the year,

523
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,900
we're going to have a lot of things in the beginning.

524
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,660
We're going to have this process that we're

525
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,060
going to be doing in this process.

526
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,540
And so we've said in this book that we're

527
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,940
going to be doing something that's

528
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,700
going to be based on the fact that we're going to be doing

529
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,460
something that's better than the other ones.

530
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,500
And so that's the right thing to do.

531
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,220
So I've also mentioned in the book

532
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,340
that this is a real thing that's all different.

533
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,660
Not only did we reduce the value of the structure,

534
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,460
we've got reduced the cost of the process.

535
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,260
But we've got to make it in a way that's

536
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,140
going to be more effective in the process.

537
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,140
And we've got to make it in a way that's

538
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,380
more effective in the process.

539
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,220
And we've reduced the cost of the process

540
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,660
by a lot more than before.

541
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,700
So we're going to be using the cost of the process

542
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,540
to make it more effective.

543
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,740
So that's the second question we're going to be asking.

544
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,260
So I'll say we have to answer that.

545
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,780
And the third question is, there's

546
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,380
no one that's going to be speaking.

547
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,780
You can take the one that's going to be speaking.

548
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,820
But that's the one that's going to be speaking.

549
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,860
And it's going to be the first one.

550
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,380
So why does the system just combine and just

551
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,500
go through and through?

552
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Well, that's the second question.

553
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,700
So let's start with the five questions.

554
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,540
So just to give you a little bit of information.

555
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,180
Now, we've come to a point where we're

556
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:45,360
using the

557
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,000
cost of the process.

558
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,120
So the three questions are, what's

559
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,440
the number of participants that are coming in?

560
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,400
Which is, how many are in the audience?

561
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,680
So the five is going to be the number of participants

562
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,560
that are in the audience.

563
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,360
So that's the third question.

564
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,880
So that's the third question.

565
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,600
Is there a number of participants that are in the audience?

566
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,760
Any more?

567
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,560
There is a number of participants that are in the audience.

568
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,200
So we're going to be talking about that.

569
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,960
So that's the number of participants.

570
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,440
Where are they?

571
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,400
In the audience.

572
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,000
So we're going to be talking about the audience.

573
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,280
And we're going to be talking about the end of the audience.

574
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,360
And we're talking about things like two or three

575
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,920
minutes of each week without a presentation

576
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,840
of at least two appearances, which

577
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,520
means definitions of-so you know,

578
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,420
the vegetarian religiousdan air вони think abohiticity.

579
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,580
Suddenly, they're not saying, but we're

580
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,280
still really obsessed with sharing what's

581
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,100
in front of the audience, which of course

582
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,400
is what's in front of us.

583
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,700
So when you start taking interactions,

584
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,740
which means we're not talking about something

585
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,860
when you're doing something about it.

586
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,560
And when you're talking about something

587
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,040
you can use them as prompt language.

588
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,340
So it's better particularly as a behavior

589
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,980
school, and we'll just took these into consideration

590
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,260
as a kind of way where you can most constantly

591
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,060
in your books.

592
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,040
I've got some small examples with stolentes

593
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,460
in this collection of references generalized

594
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,620
and just the way it variables up with the menacing

595
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:13,180
homes to extra stuff that you have in

596
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,480
of very very important食べ tales,

597
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:33,100
which type were removed from the

598
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,360
3GA.

599
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,340
These were funny things.

600
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,160
He's talking about keeping the

601
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,840
fish alive while the fish

602
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,940
waste energy and energy fluid

603
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,180
and they say I have no respect for the other

604
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,220
Meet on Signs who just pro of them.

605
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,380
And then when asked about the Sprinkle around me,

606
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:58,620
I also want to tell you about the Railings

607
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,080
in a mail of science on donate,

608
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,200
to find out how to do it,

609
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,700
here are some modified tools

610
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,780
to control 어�.

611
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,220
Because if you just copy them

612
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:30,180
pretty obtuse.

613
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,860
So if you are able to do this, you have the right to do it.

614
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,780
And that's just really interesting.

615
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,260
It's like we're talking to a very special client

616
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,940
that we're going to introduce you to today.

617
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,940
So I'll give you a brief introduction.

618
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,940
So I'll give you a brief introduction.

619
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,940
So I'll give you a brief introduction.

620
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,420
So I'll give you a brief introduction.

621
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,140
So I want to say that we're going to accept this very much.

622
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,340
We have to accept that much more than we can get together.

623
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,680
So it would also go a lot easier on my suspect.

624
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,800
So then I'm going to bring it to you first.

625
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,920
It's time to come across some of the things

626
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,160
that we haven't spoken so far.

627
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:24,080
I'll just

628
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,020
quickly bring them to you.

629
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,020
We have several experiments that are being done in the United States,

630
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,020
it's close to the US, that we want to do in the US,

631
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,020
to provide the experiments for the United States,

632
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,020
and I'm really looking forward to that.

633
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,020
So, we're just not going to do the experiments,

634
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,020
we're going to follow the steps that we've taken.

635
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:45,020
So, the three things that we have to think about is the three steps that we've taken,

636
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,020
and that's the critical ones.

637
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,020
So, the critical ones are not just the steps that we've taken,

638
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,020
but the critical ones, which are the things that we've been trying to do,

639
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,020
and that's what we've been trying to do in the US.

640
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,020
We have experiments in the United States that we've done in the US,

641
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,020
and we're going to follow the steps that we've taken,

642
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,020
and we're going to do the three steps that we've been trying to do in the US,

643
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,020
which is the critical ones.

644
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,020
And those are the things that we've been trying to do,

645
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,020
and I'm going to talk about them in a moment,

646
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,020
but I'm going to talk about them in a moment,

647
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,020
so maybe both of them are very complex, very complicated.

648
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,020
But, you know, the family is going to do it first,

649
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,020
so families are going to do it first,

650
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,020
and the family is going to do it first,

651
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,020
and the family is going to do it first,

652
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,020
and I'm going to be watching the program for the next couple of minutes.

653
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,020
The program is called The Cards.

654
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,020
It's one of the general experiments that we've been doing in this country,

655
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,020
and it's a very complex thing.

656
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,020
It's a very complex project,

657
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,020
and it's one of the things that we've been talking about in the last few minutes,

658
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,020
and I'm going to talk about it in a moment,

659
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,020
because we've been doing very complex things again,

660
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,020
and we've done a few different things,

661
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,020
and we've got a complex of things.

662
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,020
We've done a bunch of different things in the US,

663
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,020
and it's your efforts and your imagination that's been with us

664
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,020
being in the US,

665
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,020
and it's the problems that we've found to be much more complex,

666
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,020
which is the thing.

667
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,020
Thank you.
