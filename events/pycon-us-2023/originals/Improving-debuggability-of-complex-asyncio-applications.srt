1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,320
I have, uh...

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,240
I like the three members of the

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,640
You can step right up to stand in your seat,

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,400
stand inside,

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,200
Remember,

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,280
next round,

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,960
hands on your block to step in.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,320
And is slightly certain

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,400
to go into a smaller room.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,360
Excuse me?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,660
the

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,080
internet web page.

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:45,780
its

14
00:01:45,780 --> 00:02:11,900
The

15
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,900
This is just a quick overview of the things that we need to think about.

16
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,900
So, I'm going to start with the first question.

17
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,900
So, the first question is, how do you think the government is going to deal with the

18
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,900
pandemic?

19
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,900
And how do you think the government is going to deal with the pandemic?

20
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,900
And how do you think the government is going to deal with the pandemic?

21
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,900
And how do you think the government is going to deal with the pandemic?

22
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,900
And how do you think the government is going to deal with the pandemic?

23
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,900
And how do you think the government is going to deal with the pandemic?

24
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,900
So, the first question is, how do you think the government is going to deal with the pandemic?

25
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,900
And how do you think the government is going to deal with the pandemic?

26
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,900
And how do you think the government is going to deal with the pandemic?

27
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,900
And how do you think the government is going to deal with the pandemic?

28
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,900
And how do you think the government is going to deal with the pandemic?

29
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,900
So, the first question is, how do you think the government is going to deal with the pandemic?

30
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,900
And how do you think the government is going to deal with the pandemic?

31
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,900
And how do you think the government is going to deal with the pandemic?

32
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,900
And how do you think the government is going to deal with the pandemic?

33
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,060
I have cookies for you, I have cookies for you.

34
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,060
100 out of 500 cookies.

35
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,180
somehow, it's over-fstanding, it seems, but alsoM

36
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,180
Jost and I are going to do another thing together.

37
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,180
Yes, like that, we are going to do another concept.

38
00:03:51,180 --> 00:04:06,060
Alan make you

39
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:31,900
Dates you- the

40
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:50,680
Here, we see, then, very

41
00:04:50,680 --> 00:05:17,300
arrangements that we can implement on a

42
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:54,300
So, I think that we need to start to think about the process.

43
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:01,300
So, I think that we need to start to think about the process.

44
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,300
I think that we need to start to think about the process.

45
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,300
I think that we need to start to think about the process.

46
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:16,300
I think that we need to start to think about the process.

47
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,300
So, I think that we need to start to think about the process.

48
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:28,300
So, I think that we need to start to think about the process.

49
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,300
I think that we need to start to think about the process.

50
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,300
I think that we need to start to think about the process.

51
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:43,300
So, I think that we need to start to think about the process.

52
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,240
You've heard of an interesting balloon called Gias

53
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,940
Gias ship.

54
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,740
What does that mean?

55
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,240
In Sun.

56
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,240
Ampa it means or perhaps it means about an city.

57
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,300
So, in Sun it means about an city.

58
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,300
It's not a name of the :(

59
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:28,880
but without grated

60
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,680
so Patrick is involved, as you know, so I hope both of you could also Godsmakers exploring

61
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,320
to increase the demand of people to know what this new low processing is, and what opportunity

62
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,780
we have around it, writing one here, now there is the rotation of the blue light, but we

63
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,380
also have the simulation running, which is, of course, the red industry, but we the

64
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,400
creative industry, the left industry, we are at patent use, but we are not at the

65
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,620
quarry.

66
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,920
So it is an image of the middle line, but in depth we can use the scene wide-angle

67
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,780
under the

68
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,360
to

69
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,620
to

70
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,800
to

71
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,800
to

72
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,400
to

73
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
And that's what we're going to do.

74
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
We're going to do a lot of research.

75
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

76
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

77
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

78
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

79
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

80
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

81
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

82
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

83
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

84
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

85
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

86
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

87
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

88
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

89
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

90
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

91
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

92
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
And we're going to do a lot of research.

93
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
And really our research is actually

94
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
more or less about how radioactive

95
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
tanks are evolved.

96
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,340
And historically enough,

97
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,100
we really had come into action

98
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,400
to findissenc.

99
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
And in 2016, as the World Health Organization

100
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
posted the name of the World Health Organization

101
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,200
generalization

102
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,960
are

103
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,260
related to the

104
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:49,560
and

105
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:57,200
From time to time, this namesake may cause computer synapses.

106
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
We call them shakes.

107
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:09,600
This uses surround interfaces on both sides of the roll assisted

108
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,320
to play the actual music at low levels,

109
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:20,320
So, we have to be able to take advantage of that to be able to put some value in this.

110
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,320
And I think that's the point that we need to take.

111
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
I think that's the point that we need to take.

112
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
I think that's the point that we need to take.

113
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
I think that's the point that we need to take.

114
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
And I think that's the point that we need to take.

115
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,320
I think that's the point that we need to take.

116
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
And I think that's the point that we need to take.

00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
And I think that's the point that we need to take.

127
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
And I think that's the point that we need to take.

128
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
And I think that's the point that we need to take.

129
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
And I think that's the point that we need to take.

130
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,320

And I think that's the point that we need to take.

132
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
And I think that's the point that we need to take.

133
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,320
We can now support Dr Entscheid,

134
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Dr真的很, Dr Ed retired

135
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,320
And we don't have a mental trauma.

136
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,440
And it never actually

137
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,320
can interfere with your health.

138
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
It can interfere with your familyain

139
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,320
levels health condition.

140
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
And kind of create

141
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
situations where people can

142
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
be சquently diagnosed.

143
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,320
So what I am He Jian

144
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,940
So what I am He Jian

145
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,220
I think is just it's a very كева

146
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,800
antihistemic

147
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
issue that we can challenges.

148
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,520
and how it's different, because I've never air lockdown to employed authentically.

149
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,060
But just like the weather weather bring you conversation,

150
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,980
to be completed.

151
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,880
During those conversations,

152
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,180
at present we're sorry to say that the community was limited

153
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,420
but pushed us blinded for about 1 hour,

154
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,580
but unfortunately during that time

155
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,980
in following instrumentation,

156
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,900
and his girls, specifically older one to her

157
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,780
It has mega suspension at that time,

158
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,560
then he came back with his sister Party

159
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,100
to teacher and落 discount cards on him

160
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:34,320
The big challenge forouver выбbers

161
00:12:34,320 --> 00:13:02,820
Also, receiving the

162
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,820
What we've been wasting on, therefore, is not only Sorry, just because we aren't sugar,

163
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,320
but this extra 20-year time that we've spent attacking.

164
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:23,600
What we've wasted, either commissioned or demonstrated, on is this unfair, that ADA has

165
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,620
La Capirana be used of race Fernando Tierre Pesquisita, who has talked about this every morning

166
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:33,640
gaming, it's not just seen as a given, and it is to the keepers of our industry doing

167
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,520
it's a part of the

168
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,800
effective

169
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,880
ady

170
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,760
it's

171
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,340
test

172
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,800
test

173
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,140
tool

174
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,040
in

175
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:14,100
the

176
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:27,360
What we then Chinese

177
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:40,560

and tending to beauty along the lines of

201
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,020
Fortunately, creating with your community

202
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,280
to realize just a obrigatory plan

203
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,380
that those new changes that occur

204
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,360
toета sonicans would make

205
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,920
because they expect who have the

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,300
knowledge, effort to achieve

207
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,580
our capacity to achieve these changes

208
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,180
and walk right inside of human identity.

209
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,820
Now, at the moment, the process

210
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:30,580
that is not explicitly development or

211
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:38,380
work that can get up in a lot of different stairways or that can teach the clients the

212
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:45,720
El option of Ngla so I can get to where I want to get that out of our heads, because I know

213
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,580
they want to help the clients as much as they can for the whole young project so I hope

214
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:57,280

00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,780
It's just a challenge to do it.

225
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,220

In all of the activities this is a city to really develop a diversity for you and your group.

295
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:17,300

The diff embedded in the site.

It's available to download it from www. nagyonfeil.com

300
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,240
and they are also very innovative at

301
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,040
many specific aspects of the

302
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,040
process and at the industry.

303
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,040
So, I would just add to that

304
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,040
that I am sure that

305
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,040
I would be able to take on

306
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,040
the potential in the

307
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,040
United States of America

308
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,040
and the United States of America

309
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,040
and the United States of America

310
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,040
and the United States of America.

311
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,040
This was a statistic that

312
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,060
actually was very

313
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,040
very, very, very, very, very

314
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,040
very, very good.

315
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,040
And I think that

316
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,040
this is a very, very, very

317
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
good statistic because

318
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,020
I am sure that

319
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,680
if you consider the

320
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,540
effects of the substance

321
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,540
after taking it to a

322
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,540
source in the United States

323
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,220
of the United States.

324
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,280
And demo sue

325
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,420
worked out well.

326
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,540
I think that

327
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,680
an honest

328
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,980
Now an honest

329
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,600
That an honest

330
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,400
government,

331
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,880
that hand

332
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:51,180
Within our

333
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:55,180
and the success of the work has been a big help to us.

334
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,180
I contribute to the social justice movement in the United States

335
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,180
and I think it's a great opportunity to interact with the United States

336
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:09,180
and I think it's a great opportunity to share the interest of the people

337
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,180
who are interested in the work that is being done in the United States.

338
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:17,180
It's a great opportunity to share the work that is being done in the United States

339
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:24,180
and I think it's a great opportunity to interact with the people in the United States

340
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:33,980
so we can fight together against the

341
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:39,180
receiving the health benefits of the same kind of earns.

342
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:43,820
And there's the sense ofiries really building on

343
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,820
and the best case scenario is that you have a very good team

344
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,820
and you have a very good team of people who are very good

345
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,820
at the job and who are very good at the job.

346
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,820
And so, we have to take a very good approach

347
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,820
and take a very good approach to the job.

348
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,820
And so, we have to take a very good approach to the job.

349
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,820
And so, we have to take a very good approach to the job.

350
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,820
And so, we have to take a very good approach to the job.

351
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,820
And we have to take a very good approach to the job.

352
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:36,820
So as you can see, the reset pool – and can be a task that can be done

353
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:53,020
Future Ret

354
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,640
To

355
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,360
make

356
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:23,400
to

357
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:53,320
before we population, society T.

358
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,720
But it is once you understand the nature to the perspective,
