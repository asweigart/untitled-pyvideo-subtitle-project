00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that's okay

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm just going to say.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
saying

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm just going to say I'm not

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,700

One of accent중 effect이랑

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,860
As we walked streets in

26
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,860
And I just wanted to add that I'm a person of a diverse background,

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,860

28
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,860
so if you have any questions,

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,860
then you can leave the chat,

30
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,860
and you can ask me.

31
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,860
And I'll also show you,

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,860
in the chat, what I do,

33
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,860
and I'll also show you how to practice your text.

34
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,860
And I'll also show you how to sit down

35
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,860
and show you how to write,

and I'll also show you how to write.

39
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,860
So basically

40
00:01:50,860 --> 00:02:14,220
the homeless, the Black

41
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:31,940
His

42
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,340
I think that's a great way to start a conversation.

43
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,540
And I think that's a great way to start a conversation

44
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,940
about what the challenges are,

45
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,540
and how to get the best out of it.

46
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,540
And I think that's a great way to start a conversation

47
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,340
about what the challenges are,

48
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,540
and how to get the best out of it.

49
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,540
And I think that's a great way to start a conversation

50
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,940
about what the challenges are,

51
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,540
and how to get the best out of it.

52
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,540
And I think that's a great way to start a conversation

53
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,340
about what the challenges are,

54
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,540
and how to get the best out of it.

55
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,940
And I think that's a great way to start a conversation

56
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,340
about how to get the best out of it,

57
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,140
and how to get the best out of it.

58
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,500
wizard

59
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,240
so that they can take-off confidence

60
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,420
or

61
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,520
like I say,

62
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,580
I highly recommend a negative,

63
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,820
but

64
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,580
this is a veryComment reality

65
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,940
after you tolerant

66
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,740
it were thought that

67
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,040
because they cracked our

68
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:57,280
The

69
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,520
you see now in exhale or an😂, it is actually up schaut in on Märsburg Lee so still in the

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:09,440
thick, this is still there in the 80s it's available on a specific page you can go and

71
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:17,760
find something is in apple this three sizes just semi-res GTF alongside the standard with

72
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,900
youth in prices, they can by the trend they it thesels.

73
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,840
They just can't wear it, they can't wear it.

74
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,400
This is too much for the audio system,

75
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,720
I don't think that people can satisfy

76
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,360
a core this driver要 Iran right here at all right

77
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,680
because there's so many concerns

78
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,360
that he is known for this device

79
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,200
because he doesn't know how to use it.

80
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,420
So you may still use it without listening

81
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,380
and chatter on this and that,

82
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:42,920
and almost all times I look at it

83
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,760
like it's just on remote.

84
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,480
So when that is obvious to the people

85
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:56,480
which you can search where can I buy this kit with a dedithis dot box on a syn optimize

86
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,760
you have to select it exactly before you make the purchase because we are not going to conflicting

87
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,100
pillboxesatorium on this kit.

88
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:17,960
At a few point of our either send maybe text err maybe a video on it which saw everything

all of which were

variety of kinds,

97
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,340
and then some as

98
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,360
a version of the

groups involved

103
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,480

And as I said while standing,

110
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:39,680
actually the best way is to folly before the flow of oversized

111
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,180

The best-astre

00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,900
that alone can solve these problems.

114
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,280
And lots of other further

115
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,600
difficulties are

116
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,160
particularly serious,

117
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,560
where the detection of

118
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,260
researchers,

119
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,480
and then their data

120
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,680
was dominated with

121
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,020
experts

122
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,320
And though that statement is ok, The party stands clear.

123
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,420
The matter remains tied to a tough situation in which a

124
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,980

And you told that information to me.

136
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,200
I said that is another fast school,

137
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,480
you could go to them all who all of you have future homework.

138
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,120
And I spent a lot spending people on that fast school tests.

139
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,480
I saved a lot.

140
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:58,780
I think that was the end

141
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,540
of chaos.

142
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,880
And in the space between schools,

143
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
in the mid circle.

144
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,760
They would start to talk backed out unless they were

145
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,100
in school, with class, by door.

146
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Just looking at their academic

147
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,860
force they were back on the court.

148
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:20,180
Get involved in this work, you could be at work but though part of that work required

149
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:29,320
the delivery team to juncture staff that is actually going to get the orders from you.

150
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:38,060
And with this process I was RMIT lamp stealers I have also known to agree to migrate the

151

153
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,760

and these issues are not being discussed

157
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,080
to that point, The White House,

158
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,600
it will make the roses

159
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,100

of U.S. states isrun

162
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,800
that that's the name

163
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,040
and it's just a lot of fun.

164
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,800
And I think that's a great thing,

165
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,720
because it's a lot of fun to be able to see things.

166
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,320
And especially in the US,

167
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,120
generally, the US is still the most

168
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,560
interesting and the most diverse place.

169
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,520
And it's just a lot of fun to be able to see

170
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,200
all these different things.

171
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,400
And I think that's a great thing,

172
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,560
because it's a lot of fun to be able to see

173
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,000
the different things that are happening

174
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,280
in the US and in the US.

175
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,880
So, I'm going to go through the different things

176
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,720
that are interesting to us,

177
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,960
because I want to give you some examples

178
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,880
of different kinds of things.

179
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,240
One of the things that I like to say

180
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,120
is that we are going to be

181
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,120
just going to be doing this in the US.

182
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,200
We are going to be doing this to complete the US.

183
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,280
So, I want to give you a few examples

184
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,080
of different types of things that are happening

185
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,120
in the US and in the US.

186
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,560
And I think that's a great thing.

187
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,160
A lot of things that are interesting to us

188
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,640
are the things that are interesting

189
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,800
to be able to see in the US.

190
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,800
So, one of the things that we need to do

191
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,640
is to be able to see the different types

192
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,720
of things that are happening in the US.

193
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,760
And so, I'm going to give you some examples

194
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,600
of different things that are happening in the US.

195
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,640
And I'm going to give you a few examples

196
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,160
of different things that are happening in the US.

197
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,440
So, let's go ahead and start with the first example,

198
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,880
which is the Canada Belt.

199
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,560
So, across the countries,

200
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,920
there are a huge maths set

201
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,320
of the few things that have been done

202
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,920
within that transitioned single country

203
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,280
at the original compassion meeting,

204
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,320
AJD.

205
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,720
So, actually, that's part of this proposal,

206
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,560
is out to stay and see

207
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,080
and as adults or as young people mature,

208
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,920
nursing, gaping and how young people

209
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,440
have apprendre how to be about not having to get sponsored

210
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,960
on the thought of going back.

211
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,520
To illustrate what we're heading for,

212
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,200
there are a couple of tips that I want to share with you

213
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,180
to keep cutting it.

214
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:32,420
So, it 가�джlding a

215
00:12:32,420 --> 00:13:00,160
and that the

216
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:17,640
Or, whenever they meet, they stand and vote.

217
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:42,860
The

218
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,280
under raspberry kernel 3 and the Congressive application

219
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,580
under lost quotation report

220
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,760
you need to understand the equation

221
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,660
in tears the cameo of some errors in the yapmış

222
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,040
use the same equation

223
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,620
under the Google apart

224
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:06,580
about both the

225
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,700
the

226
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:23,200
of the

227
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:32,420
Fed.

228
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,360
called me.

229
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,780
Then, using tips to influence other others,

230
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,060
I realized that s кру waxing amounts to completely

231
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,420
irrational, un marketing aggressive.

232
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,160
Em Cleaners don the same things we do

233
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,820

reduce ourMusikival or

to ears looking process so we get

236
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,260
what other people think we humble.

237
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,500
And

238
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,940
match.

239
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,200
And if you believe in reality in the author's

240
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:16,540
model, if you are so excited about the

241
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,700
world to follow, get to know your trail with

243
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,640
What can I say to somebody that would

244
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,240
understand history?

245
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,100
Thanks for 2 Parazeni flavor

246
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,740

And this is something that is important, but the potential of this is a very small thing

253
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
that I have.

254
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,360
So, the first thing I want to talk about is this.

255
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,360
I want to talk about the steps that we need to take in order to make this a reality.

256
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,360
And I think we can make this a reality.

257
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,360
And I think we can make this a reality.

258
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,360
And I think we can make this a reality.

towards it differently

296
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,380
and it didn't seem to be

297
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,580
as particular towards the

298
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,360
internship silhouettes.

299
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,200
insane CRs,

300
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
there were so many cases

and nice

306
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,140
because if the education has more emerged

307
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,060
from long term institutions to all the groups in investment,

308
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,440
especially IfTIGE,

309
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:58,520
and you said if we would have more

310
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,680
graduated CSCs.

311
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,560
the roundup would not just simply be

312
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,440
or I am just trying to play that

313
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,120
but this idea ofready

314
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,100
with this partnership

315
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,100
objects in an area with less Rochester warehouses.

316
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:36,000
Now, I'd like to talk a bit about how this library is being lost its

317
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:46,280
from? And we will be stuck with the commentary. I will be taking full coverage' over.

318
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:58,120
So I want to thank everyone out there for sitting here today and filling in in the Chicken

319
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,120
and that's what we're going to do.

320
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,100
We're going to take a look at the

321
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,100
kind of side effects that we're going to be taking

322
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,100
and we're going to take a look at

323
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,120
the side effects of the

324
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,120
positive effect of the

325
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,100
positive effect of the

326
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,100
positive effect of the

327
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,100
positive effect of the

positive effect of the

330
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,100
positive effect of the

331
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,100
positive effect of the

332
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,100
positive effect of the

333
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
positive effect of the

334
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,100
positive effect of the

335
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,100
positive effect

336
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,100
of the positive deadly

337
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,100
powerful

338
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,100

of the video

341
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,600
and the same thing, but it's important to understand

342
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,200
how to find out where you're supposed to be.

343
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,560
And you need to find a solution to this problem

344
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,440
and you need to find a way to get back out there

345
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,600
just as quickly.

346
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,240
And that's it.

347
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,600
So that's the end of the Q&A.

348
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,680
I'm going to stop there.

349
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,320
I'm sorry, if you have any questions,

350
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,600
please leave them in the comments below.

351
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,840
If you have any questions,

352
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,600
I'm going to try to answer them in the Q&A

353
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,800
and then we'll stop.

354
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,200
But before I do, I'm going to start with the three things.

355
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,480
Thank you, technology.
