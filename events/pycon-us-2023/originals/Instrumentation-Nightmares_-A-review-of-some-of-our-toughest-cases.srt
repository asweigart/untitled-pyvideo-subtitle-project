1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I think that's the most important thing for us to do.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We need to be able to do this in a way that we can do it in a way that we can do it in

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
a way that we can do it in a way that we can do it in a way that we can do it in a way

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that we can do it in a way that we can do it in a way that we can do it in a way that

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
we can do it in a way that we can do it in a way that we can do it in a way that we

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
can do it in a way that we can do it in a way that we can do it in a way that we can do

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
it in a way that we can do it in a way that we can do it in a way that we can do it in

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,160
our Princess when Peko underneath Nyoника fan and choose all the

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:56,320
seasons as it does all the seasons as it does for

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:23,720
account of his

00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,600
Upset at the meeting, the lotta

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,960
media talks at a faster

download Fix

14
00:01:39,200 --> 00:02:04,240
are the titular

15
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,260
make any mistake, there will be false word Down Orbit,

16
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,200
I'm Esperanto.

17
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,480
Yes you're surprised at heaven I would give A genderless

18
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,840
everything confirmed inыватьars

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,520
You just machine-check it a lot or it doesn't seem to be for you

20
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,540
Especially when she had no fucking class

21
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,840
Me either

00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,360
C mentalite

23
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,500
samo

24
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,200
You're right It's inaudible

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,100
It's inaudible

26
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,560
lets use a k wave

27
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,640
and I'm just showing why it's working.

28
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,920
So that will be a conclusion to a very short graph

29
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,660
of mostly together structure tree beef

30
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,820
but we'll discuss in detail

31
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,780
which is to obstacles in and around competition

32
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,640
and defensing the irascible,

33
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,500
and the essa- hunches,

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Gold如果 handles

35
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,880
even if you suggested in exactly so

36
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,880
you put me.

37
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,360
That's why the

38
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,780
most useful information

39
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,760
I want to uh

40
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,800
go straight to And which claim all

41
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,960
that I could it absolutely

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,980
absolutely war

43
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:34,480
Cooking with you in a collective table present.

44
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:44,660
Did you know how to maintain birth 800,000 women?

45
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,480
Number 6 is the

46
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,520
V terror!

47
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,160
Because of nuke, alcohol and heroin,

48
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,080
all start setting,

49
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,320
experiments, hospitals and health cell,

50
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,960
on the overall growth of children,

51
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,300
and they aim to actually increase women's who are

52
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,080
around the world's best friends.

53
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,080
And at the time of the work, we were still collecting the data from the service women

54
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,080
unit, and we were still getting the data back.

55
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,080
And we were interested in collecting the data at the end.

56
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,080
And we were still finding that we had to stay clean from the land.

57
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,080
And we were already doing that with the other girls from class.

58
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,080
That was a really great opportunity.

59
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,080
And we were just like, hey, she was a good person.

60
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,080
And she was.

61
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,080
And we were just like, hey, she was.

62
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,080
And we were just like, hey, she was.

63
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
And we were just like, hey, she was.

64
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
And we were just like, hey, she was.

65
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,080
And we were just like, hey, she was.

66
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,080
And we were just like, hey, she was.

67
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,080
And then we were, again, looking for...

68
00:04:41,080 --> 00:05:01,380
We were looking for

69
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:12,520
it

70
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:25,120
All the most

71
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,060
The

72
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,120
So, this is a very difficult skill.

73
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,120
It's a very difficult skill, but it's a very difficult attribute.

74
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,120
And I'm not going to tell you what it is, but it's very difficult.

75
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,120
It's a very difficult attribute.

76
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,120
What does it do?

77
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,120
Well, it's a very difficult skill.

78
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
I don't have to tell you what it does.

79
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
It's a very difficult skill.

80
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,120
It's a very difficult skill for our business.

81
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm going to show you a few examples of different attributes.

82
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,120
So, this is something that's very cool.

83
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,120
I'm going to show you a few examples of different attributes.

84
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,120
I'm going to show you a few examples of different attributes.

85
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,120
So, this is one of the most difficult attributes.

86
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,120
It's a very difficult skill.

87
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,120
So this can be a real A sincerity of NIYAL JOB.

88
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,120
But we need to know 360S of wahr梁.

89
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,120
We need to know 360S of wahr梁.

90
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,120
And what needs to be done to make a 360S of virtually non baked human?

91
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,620
The person in

92
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,580
And so that's it for our

93
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,120
score below the next question,

94
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,120
not changing the fabric of the novel.

95
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,120
And this is a kind of a contrived experience.

96
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,620
It's not something that is actually in the script,

97
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,120
but it's a really nice sort of experience

98
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,620
where they get the fabric of the novel,

99
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,120
but it's just a case of the play,

100
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,120
you know, the actions, or just,

101
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,620
it's just a kind of a play,

102
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,620
and all of the time, you know,

103
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,620
it's a bit of a reader, but it's just a piece of paper.

104
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,120
It's a bit of a rough.

105
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,120
So, this is a bit of a very simple,

106
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
classic arrayplane,

107
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
all real stuff,

108
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
and it's all actually an array,

109
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
you can actually see how easy it is

110
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,120
to read and actually express that in it.

111
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
In this story we are going to be talking

112
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,120
about how much idea we can put it into

113
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,400
First, we're going to show you

114
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,120
what's going to make us across the wheels.

115
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,120
So, we start with the front,

116
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,120
we'll come around and then we get into

117
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,620
the command line, or mixer,

118
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,120
neded tournament, one frame by frame,

119
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
and we go in on the left hand side,

120
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,120
just about 30 minutes after inking went out

121
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
we just felt like putting on some

122
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,120
block particle research on

123
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,620
on

124
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:38,220
multiple kinds of Chinese's

125
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,700
because it is important

126
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,360
to have편- boş't be unaware

127
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,440
from the week before

128
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,180
otherwise we don't have to

129
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,280
this is a tool that brings

130
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,320
new kilometres of possible

131
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,800
parameters

132
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,580
used

133
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,840
as a kind of Wohnung proof

134
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,580
So you is a

135
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,780
advise of provisions

136
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,060
for the future baguette

137
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,260
millions for borders

138
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,140
There is nothing at the moment

139
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,360
to

140
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,820
fix their

141
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,680
because psychology

142
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,440
It is a social

143
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,120
but as soon as Christmas is coming to our lives,

144
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,820
people love us, and those are greatinconn parentingtimes,

145
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,420
but whenever you're getting married and active,

146
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,020
it's easy for you and me to rush to it.

147
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,220
And especially kids are 2 or 3 years old

148
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,820
or 6 or 7 years old.

149
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,120
Well it's a fantastic, never poverty cuts,

150
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,120
but I'm pat in the crotch,

151
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,120
so I'm at the heart of the xmas.

152
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
And I don't think there's a chance

153
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,620
if I forget New Year's Day,

154
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,920
as it's much less than a year.

155
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,120
it has a origin, it has a historical point, and it has a unique reverent background.

156
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,920
Now when you rescind the original version, this isagrecy-rich Breakthrough,

157
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,220
the teller can be gravitational,

158

or the Arizona configure rule in measuring,

159
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,720
How the original original version wasn'tELLEVERSTAPLES,

That's theเภб BARSH Grand Prix devices.

165
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,840
Yet in the BBC, it's still an primary, cowardly design.

166
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,640
However...

167
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,520
...the Holtes' in the number 5 spot.

168
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,880
One of the disadvantage is that in some places where the numbers are morph so compactly...

169
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,560
...because all of the first two lane spaces are

170
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,800
not fully integrated.

171
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,580
buckets within 30 seconds for the commission were already there in 30 seconds or loops

172
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,060
credentials under 15 seconds.

173
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,720
When application for the commission was completed, we were left out in لمmering

174
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,680
protein periodic resumption because of the Notector year shoots.

175
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,620
Thisbeds at perfume headquarters agreed to note the

project pitch according to the facility development

177
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,660
assessment and there was our request for approval.

work is currently a big

impact.

00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,600
In addition to data and

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,640
Steph came up with

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,760
a few more tricks

212
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,080

00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,000

came into play

218
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,780
by further reaffirming foreign states,

219
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,100
and then arresting the subject,

220
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,840
who is entrenched as a compound chain

221
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,000

You

and that's the reason that the access is so prevalent.

249
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,940
And it is the fact that we have the potential

250
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,940
to invest in this program here.

251
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,940
But it's taking a lot of time.

252
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,940
And so I'm thinking, please, can we invest in this program?

253
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,940
So, what is the purpose?

254
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,940
What is the information that we must be doing?

255
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,940
We must be doing the same works.

256
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,940
We must be doing the same work that we have to do every day.

257
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,940
And we must be doing the right thing.

258
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,940
We must be doing the right thing.

259
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,940
I think everybody needs to be done.

260
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,940
And this needs to be 출력omanped 81.

261
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,940
Remember the first thing that we did was

262
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,940
to make the most of our budget.

263
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,460
In the same scale, we were on to just

264
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:29,260
these $ machen in this

265
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,060
And that it wouldn't have come up with $ 2M.

266
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,460
Thank you, thank you so much.

267
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,460
I'm personally very concerned.

268
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,460
This is a very, very big and very interesting and very significant work that we do since

269
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,460
childhood.

270
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,460
I really want to thank the guys who worked so hard to make this work.

271
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,460
I just want to say that this is a very significant work that we do since childhood.

272
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,460
I'm very excited about this work that we do here in the United States.

273
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,460
I'm very excited about the work that we do here in the United States.

274
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,460
Thank you Tom.

275
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,460
We're going to start with the group at the beginning of the presentation and where we're

276
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,460
going.

277
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,460
There's the question of the figure about all the neighbors and술 마지막 week.

278
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,460
Where does all these papers come from?

279
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:15,460
Where did you get these photos waiting behind you from the venue liquor Apparently,

280
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,460
believes there's been bad news.

281
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,460
And with the external US truth?

282
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,460
I don't know.

283
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,460
So said there was a few questions that came up on Tuesday or Friday.

284
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,860
I think it's so hard.

285
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,860
I think it's so difficult to imagine.

286
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,260
Okay.

287
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,060
So, this is the kind of thing that I would like to teach you guys.

288
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,060
But, I'm just going to say,

289
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,060
the kind of thing that I would like to teach you guys is

290
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,060
that you have to experience things in a stronger way.

291
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,660
And if that experience,

292
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,060
if that experience is not a strong experience,

293
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,660
or if it's not a strong experience,

294
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,060
it's not something that you can say,

295
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,260
that I think, that I think you can do.

296
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,660
Because, you know,

297
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,120
I wasn't necessarily happy listening to someone

298
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,660
talk about the

299
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,660

so

332
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,640
actually

333
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:37,820
I made an 아니� Sultanate for the Jews to build on the

334
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:45,820
This is a rep aplication of weeding technique and from people saying that you can definitely

organic you can sieveャou're very fast when you're harvesting dead 150

337
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,180
When you speak, you have to say what you want to say to the other person,

338
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:12,180
and it may seem that you're just saying the same thing, but it is actually the way you're going to talk to them.

339
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:17,180
And then, the people who are standing at the table with the kids,

340
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:23,180
they can't hear what you're saying to them, so they have to say the way you're going to talk to them.

341
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,180
So, what do you want to say to the person you're talking to?

342
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,180
Right when you sit at the prepared table with people standing,

343
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:37,180
they can't hear what you're saying, howic will sit at the table in the Christian one.

344
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:42,180
So they sort of like to sit down but they will feel like they can't just sit down.

345
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:48,180
Okay, so what do you want to say to this own-w平ick situation?

346
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,180
Yes, you have to talk to yourself a bit more than before

347
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,180
to actually say what to the other person.

348
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:58,620
They're helping people who aren't in detention under a keep Rawans Running by himself.

364
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,000
The

365
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,860
She

366
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,280
was doing

367
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,500
fundamental

368
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,520
of Unlimited

369
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,320
could you feel that more things could be done?

370
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,320
OHeptically.

371
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,740
Through there, David has found new ways

372
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,880
of provoke that discussion

373
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:12,360
that could be used in the

374
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,760
Ordealist field.

375
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,140
So it's just an example of

376
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:26,060
but that is where we are.

377
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:32,900
So Vitrupa is aorphism and that is where round goes.

378
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:41,940
This photographs are really of the closest to their rights,

379
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:47,000
base stakes and increasing the leaf size of the leaf telling success to our reading others

380
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,160
helping listen.

381
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,420
Clearly, this doesn't mean that it has in fact speculation, essentially%, because the

382
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:54,000
写 отдω459% of this sort of behaviour happens to LFWM where that is actually said to

383
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,460
have stuff dedicated to leaf or any specific sector.

384
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:04,380
And then the government acts like they aren't going to have to.

385
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,020
So luckily, if you look at this really well in general, you don't necessarily see a

386
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,260
lot of changes, because you don't have to start all that stuff, because suddenly things

387
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:28,740
for these reasons, problems such as disc метhingat Whose

388
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,040
access is in opportunities for non-FBE풂

389
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,060
The definition of O

390
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,980
We invite everyone to the events this morning and to organize the events to present.

391
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,680
Today,tag,are the기러林 вторsey webcam for our replicate

392
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,040
We are very happy to come together with all of the

393
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,500
local understands working on produces and business complex.

394
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,520
Most important part is this effect in technology because here is live talk,

395
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,500
People would think it's custom and if you take a look at the

396
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,300
screen that has this effect and see it the wrong way the

397
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,060
They know of books…

398
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,220
more specifically impressionable sources.

399
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,980
Many people know of the commercial factories over seventies.

400
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,020
No one can trust there are people like them in the mist.

401
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,500
So you can see that there are so many ones.

402
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,580
With these two, there's all time line chemical,

403
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,740
that we sound like the lack of it.

404
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,460
So we put a lot of space here for different sources

405
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,980
and types of things like organisms and beasts.

406
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,500
I don't think there are many who will be convinced that

407
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,260
they doได้.

408
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,140
Yeah, that's what we want to check

409
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:50,300
Just so, one doesn't let it lose its position back at it's place or its place by being

410
00:24:50,300 --> 00:25:14,720
Ishfまり's

411
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,180
fourth

412
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,520
piece

413
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,020
Calhart One capabilities preparation for all this work

414
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,800
have actually all loaded.

415
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,320
I've started into Black University

416
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,680
through 21 HUஙE University

417
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,560
I just have surgery but,

418
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,200
in the early 20th century,

419
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,420
I went to a summer hospital

420
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,160
that provided free doctors' doctors holding

421
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,820
this research center.

422
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,240
When Logan was carefully Memorial College

423
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,540
he gave me a directions structure

424
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,900
about all departments

425
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,400
to make a change in the way that they are being treated.

426
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,400
And that's why I'm just so excited about this.

427
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,900
I think it's a great thing for us to be able to start

428
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,400
from a very different state of mind,

429
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
to be able to have a better life,

430
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
and to be able to be able to do things

431
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,900
that we actually thought that we shouldn't think about,

432
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,900
and not feel like we should.

433
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,900
And just so, I think it's a great thing

434
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,400
to have a better state of mind about this.

435
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,400
I think it's a great thing to have a better state of mind,

436
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,900
to have a better state of mind,

437
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,900
just to look at it

438
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:35,000
and the desire to have

439
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,960
and person.

440
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,740
Of course, this was far to short

441
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,880
to do that without,

442
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,700
because it didn't seemfit to me

443
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:40,740
because I was on the

444
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,000
internet,

445
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,800
of course we decided to do it

446
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,000
but I thought maybe

447
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,820
that didn't make sense

448
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,460
in that first way,

449
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,400
in this word.

450
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,120
And so,

451
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,800
I thought maybe

452
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:58,320
it was just a

453
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,180
bit of a

454
00:27:59,180 --> 00:27:59,580
firing effect

455
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,620
or maybe just for

456
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,560
precisely

457
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,980
putting us on

458
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,480
They can take five times their calories a day.

459
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,880
Also, also, also, also, what should do

460
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,580
is follow these simple steps.

461
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,220
We've to champ on those steps.

462
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,280
Remember to step on those steps.

463
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,880
One should never, never step too fast.

464
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,680
Of course, you need to step feito rápido

465
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,240
you need to work important here.

466
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,120
Life is rough.

467
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,420
Even if you can't compete,

468
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,280
you need to grow fast,

469
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,480
and get back up,

470
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,240
don't be afraid to stay for a little bit.

471
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,520
Same withregation.

472
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,880
You just do it,

473
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,360
I believe you will Scotty, don't worry, I would love a strongview if you can escape them.

474
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,420
I will never say anything.

475
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,360
If they try to escape me, it's the end of the worlditing,

476
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:49,140
but I will surely couer they will give me death that will put them in place and save them a life

477
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,080
It must be done alliances besties.

478
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,040
You go on to outcome of european stgrunting development magazine

479
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,980
but you'll have to ahapp capita scought evottgfg

480
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,700
so you do not foil the Greek

481
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,700
but it's also because of the families.

482
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,700
So, I think it's important to understand

483
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,200
that this is a very important step,

484
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
and I think it's important to understand

485
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,700
that the people that are with us

486
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,200
are not the only ones that understand

487
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,700
that we are the same people,

488
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,200
and that we are the same parents,

489
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,700
and that we are the same people at this university.

490
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,700
And I think that this is a very important

491
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,700
and important thing to start doing.

492
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,700
Also, I think that we have to speak to our parents,

493
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,700
which are the same students and friends,

494
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,700
and so we should ask that the parents

495
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,700
understand the differences between the two families.

496
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,700
And I think that we should also consider

497
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,700
that this is a very important step.

498
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,700
We have to understand that now

499
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,700
some of the differences between the two families

500
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,700
is that they are different people,

501
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,700
and they are different people.

502
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,700
So, I think that we should start to think

503
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,700
about this from a different perspective.

504
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,700
So, I think that in almost every country

505
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,700
like they have different backgrounds,

506
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,700
in Mexico each person comes to a college

507
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,700
and has different participation and features.

508
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,700
Empe YO ANTIGU is just a symbol

509
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
of optional snap-on.

510
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,700
You can just take a phone,

511
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,700
and it's about 60 percent of the time

512
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,700
you just tap down a screen,

513
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,700
or if they click bottom first thing,

514
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,700
you can tap down that screen,

515
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,700
and if you just open that screen,

516
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,240
This information is decided, as a form,

517
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,480
fromивал dice are created.

518
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,860
This information is set in the same forms

519
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:36,160
as the golden dice.

520
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,040
However, it is not actually given,

521
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,060
because it is not written,

522
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,540
it will not be confirming.

523
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,740
It's all about tradition.

524
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,520
That's what I'm trying to say.

525
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,820
This isn't P.

526
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,700
and these two would be close.

527
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,700
And the other thing that's funny is that,

528
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,700
I don't know if you've heard this,

529
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,700
but I've heard that there's a certain

530
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,700
difference between the two of us.

531
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,700
It's that we're both very different

532
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,700
in terms of our abilities.

533
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,700
So I think it's interesting that

534
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,700
we're both very different in terms of

535
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,700
the kind of personality that we have

536
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,700
and the kind of personality that we have

537
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,700
in terms of the kind of personality

538
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,700
that we have in terms of our abilities.

539
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,700
At the same time, we always share

540
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,700
the same pain with each other.

541
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,700
We like to wear off

542
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,700
doing things that we feel are a bit

543
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,700
too small.

544
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
So both of us are sort of

545
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,700
the difference in how we approach

546
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,700
them, but sometimes

547
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,700
sometimes we're just too much

548
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,700
too much, we're not in a position

549
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,700
for ourselves to be able

550
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,700
to carry too much next

551
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,700
need not for others,

552
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,700
or it's just that,

553
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,700
So, the first thing is to make sure that you're not just talking about the medical profession

554
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,700
and the physical activity.

555
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,700
The first thing is to make sure that you're not just talking about the medical profession

556
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,700
and the physical activity.

557
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,700
And the second thing is to make sure that you're not just talking about the medical profession

558
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,700
and the physical activity.

559
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,700
And the third thing is to make sure that you're not just talking about the physical activity.

560
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,700
The fourth thing is to make sure that you're not just talking about the physical activity.

561
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,700
The fifth thing is to make sure that you're not just talking about the physical activity.

562
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,700
The sixth thing is to make sure that you're not just talking about the physical activity.

563
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,700
The seventh thing is to make sure that you're not just talking about the physical activity.

564
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,700
The formula percent for social effect is after the elderly is there,

565
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,700
calm, calm.

566
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,640
If you're even a child of the elderly,

567
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:33,700
the formula healthy saw is after the elderly is there that gives you the chance to doёрting

568
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,700
that feels like that person.

569
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,700
These are just the things that I'm trying to say about the emotional activity that actually

570
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,700
helps people about them.

571
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,700
So, the problem is that, obviously, we don't make sure that we have the support from people

572
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,720
I'm sorry?

573
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:57,720
My voice is too low.

574
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,040
3.

575
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:06,660
An industry cannot be neglected unless it can do what the capital or ruined an industry

576
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:11,900
is using ever sufficient resources and a mate, the Understandable candidate is invested

577
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:27,500
in that and it shows that marks a

578
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:07,780
for Shelter suit along with a

579
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,340
F tallulah

580
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,220
it's true, when it comes to paying for driving

581
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:30,740
what the

582
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,340
criminaliews

583
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:37,140
it's over

584
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,600
so you'll be people who South Korea is about to get rid of

585
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,540
this is an important question now

586
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,440
but in value which is as it is that

587
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,580
so we can do in often

588
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,360
they talk to a DL

589
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,760
of North我們發www

590
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,640
should

591
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,280
of

592
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,280
we

593
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,600
I will say another, this year?

594
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,100
Wouldn't you gainnym ana

595
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:20,920
It would be a moment in a decade

596
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,480
Becky and I were doing this before

597
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,000
It was a nice memories

598
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,100
and there was a goodוק

599
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,540
and the community said

600
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,680
We will get another great year

601
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,820
I also have to not forget that if I left country-by- Road,

602
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,320
there was98 years before England, but when they start to

603
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,440
have political issues and stuff, actually things

604
00:35:45,460 --> 00:36:03,920
start to get wheelchair- Cinnamon back off the

605
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,920
By the way, llamadoeries ask of the

606
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,000
enormous number, making them

607
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,040
what im cute

608
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,040
her

609
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,420
Otherwise, something similar may occur.

610
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:33,860
So the

611
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:38,680
donut sticks in words lamb assam style of stuff.

612
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,080
Which is basically toward today.

613
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,400
those steps.

614
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,820
striving.

615
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,260
They had approval of the

616
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,260
petition,

617
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:49,540
to rising in their polling

618
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:49,820
income front

619
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:55,060
Yeah,

620
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,100
matrix to pushing

621
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:08,120
the

622
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:08,620
There is.

623
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,560
What

624
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,580
to have to ensure securityO

625
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,260
45

626
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,300
and

627
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,300
yes,

628
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,160
I working

629
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:21,660
I

630
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,160
have

631
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,740
I

632
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,240
working

633
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,960
pressure

634
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,460
with

635
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:38,920
this

636
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,720
äh I could.

637
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,280
So, what's the reason for this?

638
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,880
It's not an easy question, but it's a good question

639
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,240
to look at with your brain.

640
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,160
So, what's the necessary information to have

641
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,260
this interesting question with you

642
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,280
in a standard public service to a public health care home?

643
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,360
How do you use that for personal health?

644
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,480
It can be shown at the beginning of the clip.

645
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,760
It's a simple question, but it's a good one.

646
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,360
It's a good question, but it's a good one.

647
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,240
It's a good question, but it's a good one.

648
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,640
It's a good one, but it's a good one.

649
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,260
It has an effect on the quality of your health.

650
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,980
It's not useful for theaged breast reproduce

651
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:29,400
sooner because it can be easily 120 million

652
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,440
of viruses that you can to Amb graphics medicine.

653
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,380
Most of the finished went through the pancreas

654
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,280
because care wasn't really��� tears inside,

655
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,280

At liability at CWDeck their

658
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,280
problem is we invented the

659
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,280
something at COCOM RESTRUCT RETURN that

660
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:30,000
the

661
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,060
We alwaysnote that.

662
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:45,280
Badly,

663
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,320
badly.

664
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:58,480
Badly.

665
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,480
Thank you for listening.
