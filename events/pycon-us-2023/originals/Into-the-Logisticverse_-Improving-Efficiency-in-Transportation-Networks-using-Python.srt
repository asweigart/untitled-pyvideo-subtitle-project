As a result of the overpowered industry forces from the industry as well as the industry's impact on the U.S. economy,

5
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,840
impact is substantial. We have been able to decide, as a result of the positive issue,

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,840
to build a new competitive industry to the U.S. GDP of 3.2 million.

in the shopping industry, 21.

12
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,840
And as a company, it's important to keep in mind

13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,360
that the shopping industry is operating

14
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,200
through a variety of businesses

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,800
that operate within the business

16
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,120
within two or three generations.

17
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,560
So you also have a number of people

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,520
that are paying the same amount

19
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,960
of money in the grocery turnover.

20
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,520
Secondly, we can also do the delivery

21
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,040
of the grocery industry.

22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,920
We can reconcile the goods

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,760
and services in New grip document

of the bump.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,960
As you can see,

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,080
deals of electricity starts

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,200
to put out large numbers

00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,520
of drivers.

32
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,480
It's really important to pay

33
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,100
almost half a billion потому

34
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,300
First of all,

35
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,320
think about fuel population

36
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,680
the most time-dusting series of specialities

37
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,280
of the world traffic.

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,480
So what does it mean to you?

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,720
That the traffic, when it's very, very fast,

40
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,200
that it gets very, very, very fast,

41
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,720
it's very, very fast, very, very fast.

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,120
Now, if you think,

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,320
I like to think, you know,

44
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,880
the streets will be very, very fast,

45
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,240
but the traffic, that's very, very, very fast.

46
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,680
So, how do you do this?

47
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,400
So, lets go back.

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,120

Because it is good with one part.

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,240
will not speculate on the S.H.I.E.T. Conference.

It's not a special talk, but it's really good.

125
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,320
It's really good.

126
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,740
It's really good.

127
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,300
This is a talk that I really like to do.

128
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,700

00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,700
So, I'm going to give you a brief introduction

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,760
I'm going to give you a brief introduction

134
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,020
to the S.H.I.E.T. Conference.

135

00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,120
that you can do to it.

137
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,400
So, I'm going to give you guys a brief introduction

138
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,320
to the S.H.I.E.T. Conference.

139
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,520
So, if you have a S.H.I.E.T. Conference,

140
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,440
you're going to find this thing

141
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,520
that's not just a S.H.I.E.T. Conference.

142
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,440
The S.H.I.E.T. Conference is actually

143
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,720
the first S.H.I.E.T. Conference that I've ever done

144
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,560
in my whole life.

145
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,480
It's a very special meeting.

146
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,400
We can do three things.

147
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,960
You can do a S.H.I.E.T. Conference.

148
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,600
You can do a S.H.I.E.T. Conference.

149
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,880
You can do a S.H.I.E.T. Conference.

150
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,800
You can do a S.H.I.E.T. Conference.

151
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,240
And if you want to do it,

152
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,320
you can do it.

153
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,080
And if you want to do it,

154
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,160
it's not just a S.H.I.E.T. Conference.

155
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,200
It's a very special meeting.

156
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,920
You can do a S.H.I.E.T. Conference.

157
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,280
You can do a S.H.I.E.T. Conference.

158
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,840
You can do a S.H.I.E.T. Conference.

159
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,880
You can do a S.H.I.E.T. Conference.

160
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,680
You're going to find a very special meeting

161
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,600
that I've ever done in my whole life.

162
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,200
But if you actually could start this thing

163
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,680
in terms of the S.H.I.E.T. Conference,

164
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,440
that we've been doing for over a decade,

165
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,120
I would probably do the S.H.I.E.T. Conference.

166
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,280
It's a great thing.

167
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,440
It gives us the ability to do the things

168
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,080
So, I think it might be useful to ask people,

169
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,240
about the number of women,

170
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,640
喔, how many women?

171
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,900
Choosing were you the men or women...

172
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,760
that emerged when you ask all this.

173
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:05,500
It's fair to say, that it is踏u I have not as a

174
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,060
single woman who a great woman.

175
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,060
of him is?

176
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,060

195
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,000
To the clinic, to the inj 뜻

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,020
we need to implement the filters

197
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,960
in a particular way that lets the Sachen doable

198
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:22,060
so that

199
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,820
we get complete and perfect results just as the others.

200
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,340

202
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:53,880
There is an brick in the safety cage with the

203
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,880
is that thinking death is more than just a basic suggestion

204
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,880
or бываетh the concept, we can really talk today about thinking it

205
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,380
So, this shit is a typical spitfor eating

206
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,880
that when you try to guess what it is

207
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:14,780
you can easily find out from

208
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,080
the Release of Yesterday

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,900
She said talking about达达 does just mean the other patient can't understand.

211
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,940
All right, so I just wanted to give you a bit of context

212
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,980
because there is this wonder mystery in my book

213
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,520
that shows that the Brosco was born

214
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,500
in the beginning of the uniformly accorded Interspouration.

215
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,760
The Have It Okseme Tower is built over 400 years ago and can be seen

216
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,240
in the bible, Done withرا here and ruled until the conflict started,

217
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,500
This would create negative visible temptations or

218

aẫnautar complex.

219
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,740
That's all if it is a subgroup.

220
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,720
Then how do you inquire if they are related?

221
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,200
They run in many different culturally

222
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,660
or arises so you need to brief of stand in the subgroup,

223
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:06,760
on the client, he will be able to construct an

224
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,260

225
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,440
A Friend yourself, s' gesture of religion,

226
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,300

229
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:25,540
For example, in the case of bad

230
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:32,120
part, the

231
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,800
are usually sent off to some different places

232
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,500
at the equipments in the business,

233
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,500
or that any red mark, sort of flat marks,

234
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,260
doesn't get to the system.

235
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,260
If the system get to theímpeak,

236
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,040
then I often have to go through that

237
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,940
place and have the data,

238
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,180
do everything else.

239
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,580
It may be easy to get them into it.

240
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,620
If there are any red marks here by the team members,

241
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,960
there is to inspect each target

242
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,160
station or church,

243
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,080
if it consists of any red marks,

244
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,080
depending on which area it is located.

245
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:10,720

This is for an automated one.

00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,540
Or, it could probably be.

253
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,920
And I think I could take some questions

254
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,760
about how the stroke temporary Saw their effects.

Yes

290
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,840
and I'm not sure if you can relate,

291
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,840
but I think that's why it's so difficult.

292
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
It's not just that.

293
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840
First, I think that the definition of the term

294
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,840
is that it's not a certain type of power.

295
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,840
It's a very, very, very difficult thing to understand.

296
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,840
And it's not just about having that thing

297
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,840
that you can't understand.

298
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,840
It's about having the drive force

299
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,840
to think about the fact that this

300
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,840
thing needs to be accessible to all of the pixels

301
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,840
that are any created in the graph.

302
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,840
I think it Emily said it very beautifully,

303
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,840

00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:29,380
Helpers like those facebook groups, or other groups,

349
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,320
At least members of the groups together.

350
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:38,120
Until now I've seen people try to share checks with other artists,

351
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,160
If a group presented origin and skill to myself .

352
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:47,540
But often these artists directly responded

353
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,740
in conversation with the artists

354
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,700
who became the groups.

355
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:58,240
But it probably wouldn't stand out either way.

356
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,940
In my point of view, English is very useful.

357
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:18,540
If you prefer all Americans talking in English,

358
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,200
There was a reason to feel the

359
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,860
beds, looked at windows.

360
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:30,540
And

361
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:35,340
stuff like that.

362
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,240
And

363
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,980
the

364
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,140
small

365
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,140
the

366
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,640
experience time

367
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,220
and

368
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,240
Remove

369
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,240
the

370
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:09,400
by

371
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:20,920
The

372
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:28,920
together

373
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,400
And, please do not worry about me.

374
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Thank you so much for your time.
