1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
should become sure that right now all of the packages are

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,120
all offensive, and some additional packages in the

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,900
cloud would also be good for behöver things, better

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,900
knowns, right now are not working well.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,080
So finally, welcome to, and everyone is

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,360
staying, my name is status K then.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,480
My name is Alan M hommes.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,420
introduced me for the last five years as a

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,420
And then we want to be able to show the people that they're

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,420
actually the ones who are doing it.

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,420
And how they're doing it, and how they're doing it.

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,420
So I think what we're looking at is a very, very basic

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,420
concept.

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,420
Doesn't just come from the fact that the people who are

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,420
doing it are doing it.

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,420
They're doing it for themselves.

17
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,420
So one of the things that we're looking at is the people

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,420
who are doing it for themselves.

19
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,420
And that's the people who are doing it for themselves.

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,420
The tradition does come from the experience of some

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,420
people.

22
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,420
They're the people who are doing it for themselves.

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,420
And that's the people who are doing it for themselves.

24
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,420
And so we're looking at two different ideas of the people

25
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,420
who are putting themselves into other people's lives

26
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,420
and doing it for themselves.

27
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,420
And we need to be able to work with them and see what

28
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,420
they're doing.

29
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,420
Because it's really just an expression.

30
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,420
And the way we think about it is that most people do it

31
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,420
for themselves.

32
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,420
And the other thing is that they're the ones who are

33
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,420
doing it to make things easier for themselves.

34
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,420
And I think that's important.

35
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,420
There's a difference.

36
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,420
It's a place of innovation that takes countries' policies,

37
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,420
instead of things that once took place in the ground,

38
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,420
and it became a good economy, it's a place of innovation.

39
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,420
It's a place where we need to respect it.

40
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,420
It's a place where we need to look at the problem of correct

41
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,420
vision as a person.

42
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,420
It's a place of innovation where one of the things that

43
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,420
we need to do is to look at what's in the community,

44
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,420
what's in the community as a person.

45
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,420
This is one of the tips of this mechanism.

46
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,420
The tips of this mechanism, it is a place where you take

47
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,420
just a few people to think about the difference.

48
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,420
It wasn't a place where everyone was a different person,

49
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,420
it was a place where it was a common use method,

50
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,420
which was particularly important in the early classes,

51
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,420
both in the early and the later classes.

52
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,420
The last day of the first year was a new concept,

53
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,420
the idea of a system where you try to process it

54
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,420
in a way that would be useful.

55
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,420
So, the lunch is prepared by people from the midterms

56
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,420
of the Same slowed School so that they can teach

57
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,420
students how to work with they have learned

58
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,420
a few questions from the local school at least

59
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,920
after transferring to the school.

60
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,420
It's a place where everybody's able to craft.

61
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:40,420
If a company isn't able to make all the relevant

62
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,420
and integrated research or new infrastructure

ha

104
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,780
That's the positive side of it.

105
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,720
As a great group of scientists, we've been doing some research

106
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,560
that was very specific to the click.

107
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,140
Some of the clues in the test were it's not a virus.

108
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,300
The first one, though, is that it's not

109
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,380
like that is anything else.

110
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:34,260
It's a virus that's very, very specific to the click.

111
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,680
It's not just that it's not a virus.

112
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,600
It's a virus that's very specific to the click.

113
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,660
It's a virus that's very specific to the click.

114
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,780
The main thing, though, is that it's very specific

115
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,940
to the click.

116
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,820
So that we think of it as a virus.

117
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,980
Fortunately, as we close the test,

118
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,940
it avoids the virus.

119
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,100
Only this positive part of the test

120
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,740
one of the other is the virus.

121
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,620
And then, of course, we also have to look at the virus.

122
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,620
So it's not just a virus.

123
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,620
It's a very, very specific virus.

124
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,740
So it's not just a virus that we want to do.

125
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,740
It's a virus that's very specific to the click.

126
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,940
It's a virus that's very specific to the click.

127
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,980
But fortunately, we're going to be able to see

128
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,660
the difference between the two.

129
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,840
But fortunately, we're going to be able to see

130
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,660
the difference between the two.

131
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,140
And then, of course, we also have to look at the virus.

132
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,660
What's the difference between the two?

133
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,780
It doesn't just fit the specific category.

134
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,580
It's not just the process of the virus.

135
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,240
But the particular reason why it fits the specific category

136
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,460
is because of what is the quality of the test.

137
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,060
So a quick example.

138
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,140
In settings, red level is at 20.

139
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:59,000
The quiz is des

140
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:21,780

second half of your order,

and so we're always going to

143
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:25,860
want that afterward.

144
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,020

ᾃᾀᾊ ὰ ᱵᾘ ῥᾊ ᱵᾅ ᱄ᾊᾖᾊ ᱁ᾊ ᱅ὅ ᱛᾊ ᱜᾊ Ὦᾈ ὀᶅ ὀ ሗᾇᾈὂ ᶦᾃᔪᾂ,

186
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:39,040
for the

187
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:55,940
.

188
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,040
First of all, of course, we have to think about the future.

189
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,040
And the problem is that sometimes, too, sometimes,

190
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,040
we don't have the vision to see the future.

191
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,040
And we need to think about the future.

192
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,040
So most of us don't have the vision to see all of the

193
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
future.

194
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
We need to be in the front line of the front line of the

195
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,040
future.

196
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,040
And that's what we need to do.

197
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,740
Technical questions, some technical questions for all of

198
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,740
you, basically.

199
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,040
Then thea, as you said, you were saying, work great opportunities

200
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,040
to help support the people of Camden.

201
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,640
But something about planning and tournaments is,

202
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,540
I think it's fantastic.

203
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,040
Always open to people interested in and provided

204
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,040
with opportunities to try type F3Ds,

205
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
but kept close until there was a Schl Himmle issue that

206
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,540
came up, which handled a lot of eigene issues.

207
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,340
Oh, thank you.

208
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,680
And along with that, it is also important to think about

209
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,660
the future legal process of developing softwares from

210
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,660
but particularly the public sector,

211
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
and that's one of the things that we're going to be doing.

212
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,660
And it's going to be a major change

213
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,660
in terms of public funds,

214
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,660
and it's going to be a major change in terms of the cost.

215
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,660
And the biggest change is that the country

216
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,660
is going to be less likely to go to the heart of the planet.

217
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,660
Except that it's a particularly key

218
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,660
and it's a small, very small country.

219
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,660
It's going to be a big, big problem

220
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,660
for the rest of the world.

221
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,660
And that's going to be a huge, big problem

222
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,660
for the rest of the country.

223
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,660
And that's why we've got the country

224
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,660
taking a really big step

225
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,660
that's going to take a big step

226
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,660
because the country is going to be

227
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,660
just going to be one million years

228
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,660
away from the planet.

229
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,660
So that's what's supposed to be the biggest

230
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,660
and most important thing for the system.

231
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
The country is going to be a big, big problem

232
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,660
for the rest of the world.

233
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,660
And that's how we've done it for this big statement.

234
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,660
But the big question

235
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,660
is what's going to happen to the country?

236
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,660
What's going to happen?

237
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,660
The only way to explain it

238
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,660
is through systems like the solar panel

239
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,660
which is the only way to get

240
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,660
the Earth to move.

241
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,660
If you're going to get the Earth to move

242
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,660
then you should be able to get

243
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,660
the Earth to move.

244
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
And if you're going to get the Earth to move

245
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,660
then you should be able to get

246
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,660
the Earth to move.

247
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,660
But sometimes the Earth moves

248
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,660
and sometimes it doesn't move.

249
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,660
And that's what's going to happen

250
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,660
to the world in the next few years.

251
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,660
So that's just what we're talking about.

252
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,660
So what

253
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,660
in particular

254
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,660
happens to the Earth in some cases

255
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,660
is something that we don't do.

256
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,660
Because of that, we're going to have

257
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,660
to make sure that there's a lot of space.

258
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,660
Because we're so close to Earth

259
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,660
that we're just going to have to make sure that

260
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,660
there's a lot of space for the Earth

261
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,660
to move around.

262
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,660
If the Earth doesn't move, then what happens?

263
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,660
If the Earth doesn't move, then what happens?

264
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,660
And that's what we're going to be doing.

265
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,180
Now when we talk about Earth speed relaxation

266
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,180
tell me, precisely how is it that we

267
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,180
can see the Earth in a quantum humanity group?

268
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,340
Now that we talked about the절ed انorb hypocritical

269
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,340
discussion of what goes around.

270
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,340
Although the first hint is also

271
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,340
don't go so far as go back through the data

272
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,340
to occur in space,

273
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
what is this?

274
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
And I'd say the lyrics go like this.

275
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,520
The calculation for this is it gets

276
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
shown from here and it gets sent through

277
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,260
to that space and then the people

278
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,380
So it's a little bit of a twist of the story.

279
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,220
It's a very different kind of relationship.

280
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,340
We are beginning to have a lot of different communities

281
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,500
that are close to each other.

282
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,100
So we're going to be looking at a lot of different things

283
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,500
that are happening in this business.

284
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,980
And I'm going to give you a few examples.

285
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,500
So obviously, the reason why we're

286
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,980
so close to each other is because of the way we see each other.

287
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,540
Now, what we're interested in is the reason why we see each other.

288
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,500
So we're going to be looking at the way we see each other

289
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,760
around the world.

290
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,500
Considering that it's been year on,

291
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,620
and it's been a couple wiring several

292
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,220
years people are still talking about you.

293
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,640
That's about time.

294
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,020
So whatayım.

295
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,180
You're usually talking about Fallon.

296
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,420
He's got a greary right there as you've talked about.

297
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,300
I use it often, too.

298
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,280
So basically, most of these meetings

299
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,820
And it wouldn't you even say no.

300
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,320
Right?

301
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,820
That is, you had T room.

302
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,980
And it for millions and millions of people

303
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,360
workspace like bringing that stuff into a community.

304
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,380
But is that really what they're actually doing?

305
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,060
What's happening to the world?

306
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,260
But I'm sure they're carrying that with grain of corn.

307
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,960
I'm just wondering what are the things

308
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,140
we should be doing to protect this fucking place?

309
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,680
Is it the police?

310
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,320
And what we wanted was to be able to believe that we

311
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,640
can change the world far more rights

312
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,320
ably primerally in those levels.

313
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,440
So there, it states that once the traditions are

314
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,720
consuming up to those, we may mature as they come.

315
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,220
So what are the existing endpoints?

316
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,720
And what are the emerging loan ambiguity?

317
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,720
And the ones that we've got in the budget ammetal,

318
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,880
or ‑‑ulously, that's the one.

319
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,760
It's interesting, especially if we look in the

320
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,420
over trying to learn how to use the obvious ticket,

321
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,220
so now there's the end foreign strength,

322
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,720
the same Venice of New Guinea.

323
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,040
So the difficulty with this is

324
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,720
if you start it, it'll definitely natürlich.

325
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,680
If you finish it off, you're pretty much done here.

326
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,440
The only reason why I want it to continue

327
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,640
is because it's one of those critical people

328
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,200
who didn't make a妳 response to that growing demand.

329
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,380
I wouldn't do it except for Richard哲ke,

330
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,380
who won the election last year.

331
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,100
I could never do it without him

332
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,720
who became theurable carrier

333
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,080
that66 increases market temperature.

334
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,300
He's such a great expert at these kinds of things.

335
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,700
It's driven him on the 在

336
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,840
So why this testね delicipo, why here?

337
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,040
Yeh, what's the case?

338
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,300
So we've been talking to cases in the country that are

339
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,780
specifically connected to health큰syscene and

340
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,460
not only strength in the talking option, building

341
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,900
excellent eccentrics, doing really well, preparing

342
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,680
for 71 days of systemic hipertension.

343
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,200
But the question here is the men, gays and

344
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
female survivors, regenerative health.

345
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,120
The peak reply is that when two ignored pregnant

346
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,980
and a miscarriage in the company, the goshineers

347
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,980
we're going to be doing some of the things

348
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,980
that we actually want to do.

349
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,980
So the first thing I want to do is to take

350
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,980
the questions that I've been asked,

351
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,980
and I want you to just give me the

352
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,980
questions that you've asked.

353
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,980
So you can just step into the question box.

354
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,980
Let me just walk you through the

355
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,980
different parts to make sure that

356
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,980
in theory, there's always a lot of

357
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,980
questions to ask.

358
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,980
The first thing to ask is,

359
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,980
what is true in the truth?

360
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,980
And so this is what I'm going to show you

361
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,980
in the future of the next slide.

362
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,980
So what I'm going to show you is

363
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,980
the first thing to ask is,

364
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,980
what is the biggest problem in history?

365
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,980
Because the biggest problem in history

366
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,980
is the way people think of history.

367
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,980
And the most important thing to

368
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,980
think about when we're talking about

369
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,980
history is what we need to prove is

370
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,980
that these are not just things that

371
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,980
we can discuss with people.

372
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,980
It's true that we can discuss

373
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,980
the facts of past events,

374
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,980
but it's also important to

375
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,980
show the facts that can support

376
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,980
people in the future.

377
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,980
The second thing to ask is,

378
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,980
I'm going to show you one of

379
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,980
the things that all people

380
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,980
have to do to make it happen.

381
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,980
And the first thing to ask is,

382
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,980
what is the biggest problem in

383
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,980
history and the way people think

384
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,980
about history and the things that

385
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,980
the world is going to do to

386
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,980
make it happen?

387
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,980
So here's the first thing to ask.

388
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,980
So I'm going to show you a few

389
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,980
things that we can discuss with

390
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,980
people when we're talking about

391
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,980
the facts of history.

392
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,980
So what's the biggest problem in

393
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,980
history?

394
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,980
The way we're talking about

395
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,980
the facts of the history and the

396
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:45,220
the labourers began work out of real efforts to give rock

397
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,420
I don't think that we're going to be able to do that.

398
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,960
We're going to be reluctant to do it.

399
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,960
So I think that we need to do it.

400
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,340
Because the fact that we're doing it,

401
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,520
the fact that we're doing it, is that it

402
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,920
does not exist in the first place.

403
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,420
So whether it exists in the first place,

404
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,220
that's a very good thing.

405
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,500
But then, the next thing is that it

406
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,420
doesn't exist in the first place.

407
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,420
It's not even a possible thing.

408
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,140
It's a very big thing.

409
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,820
It's impossible to respond to it.

410
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,900
And that's why it's important to do it.

411
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,300
So it's important to do it in the first place.

412
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,300
It's a very big thing to respond to.

413
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,700
Because the thing is, there's no single way

414
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,780
that we can respond to it.

415
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,620
It's not possible to do it in the first place.

416
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,100
It's impossible to respond to it.

417
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,780
But here's the point.

418
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,180
I think the point here is that it's not an extension.

419
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,700
It's not an extension.

420
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,460
It's not a function.

421
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,540
It exists for the beginning.

422
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,660
And that's what happens when you writenegative leave.

423
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,180
It's essentially an extension course.

424
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,180
We want to use this term.

425
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,980
Suppose we seek the extension course in the beginning,

426
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,060
what does it look like?

427
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,300
Where does it executive leave exist from?

428
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:10,300
Let's say

429
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,000
his thesis.

430
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,860
And that's what we want to do.

431
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,260
We're getting innovations for himself,

432
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,060
which are important in something.

433
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:27,020
But what the

434
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,340
We're going to start by asking some questions

435
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,260
from the first presenter,asure number six.

436
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,080
Some points in the parar��,

437
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,080
this instead of bringing forth the questions

438
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,400
to the three dise樸 located onto a ship

439
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,760
called the Ch Increase

440
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,840
So, the end result of the Stop marinade

441
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:50,620
Or

442
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:56,180
Not

443
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:08,800
With Interair it technically is basically it's a

444
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,220
sprinter that's required to fly.

445
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:39,020
of V 어제e al n thankfulness toHHH

446
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,460
where it says, for the remainder of the 20,000 years,

447
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,860
the first 20,000 years were the most difficult

448
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,820
of the 20,000 years, and therefore,

449
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,140
one of the most difficult things to make a human being

450
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,860
suffer.

451
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,920
The most difficult thing is to make the human being

452
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,020
suffer because it is a human being.

453
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,580
It is a human being, but it is a human being.

454
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,660
It is a human being.

455
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,980
And that's why humans are called humans.

456
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,500
Humans are humans.

457
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,140
And we have to make the 20,000 years a much more difficult

458
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,700
and difficult thing.

459
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,260
And that's why it's become a very difficult thing

460
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,020
to make a human being suffer.

461
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,940
We have to make the 20,000 years a much more difficult

462
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,020
thing, because it's a very difficult thing.

463
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,100
And that's why humans are called humans.

464
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,140
Humans are humans.

465
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,980
So it's not just a difficult thing.

466
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,420
It's a very difficult thing.

467
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,020
And it's a difficult thing.

468
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,540
But it's a difficult thing.

469
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,540
And so it's a difficult thing.

470
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,760
So let's talk about the pain of making humans suffer,

471
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,340
and that's not what the challenge is.

472
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,680
There is this motivation to encourage humans for this

473
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,680
purpose.

474
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,860
If a man might become the strongest man in the universe,

475
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,880
then that person would not be questo Temo Dei,

476
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,380
but would beESS 300.

477
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,960
If you don't have that opportunity,

478
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,560
you don't have the place for you to do it.

479
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,520
I find the occasion perhaps to talk

480
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,240
about the potential of helping others face water

481
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,480
in facing God in considering

482
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,400
safety in our days.

483
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,720
It would have been even better

484
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,440
if we'd enjoyed more privacy

485
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,520
and less嗟htr grace

486
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,580
than when we were at home

487
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,320
in New Zealand.

488
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,060
Well, obviously,

489
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,480
we couldn't help but feel

490
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,520
that 이제 we were

491
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,400
spending too much

492
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,800
time in front of the camera

493
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,080
working.

494
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,020
We would've walked

495
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,920
very early more

496
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,720
so very much

497
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,600
— well, at least eight years

498
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,020
– Pageants on AlLAB

499
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,400
happened a year after

500
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,420
the internet

501
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,880
published and released it.

502
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,480
which proliferates now referenced in evidence,

503
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,480
for a moment, or in a bit.

504
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,020
My question was, how do you know

505
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,340
exactly what is the

506
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,320
definition of the computer?

507
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,180
First, how do you know

508
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,100
that's both frequency and size?

509
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,500
And particularly in terms of

510
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,760
what benefit it brings

511
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,720
for moving the program

512
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,920
and pursuing that goal?

513
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,080
You know, seed另外

514
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,160
Gutkew balaskan

515
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,900
takes the fact of the fact

516
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,600
of so many things already,

517
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,460
for example,

518
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,300
telephone создability

519
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:05,640
Since then, mult murdered in search of information in tanks.

520
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:18,980
I am there to explain here how the

521
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:25,060
So the problem we're heh mechanisms that create the inteBI faces you, the finishes

yeeМ aY, we must control it."

525
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,480
So Volz emergeS and we better

526
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,300
appeal them to those whO hey tahts.

527
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,420
Gut you have seen Mr. Volz

g here tr

536
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,360
as it's a process of creation.

537
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,120
So it's a very strong force that is supporting us

538
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,560
in this process.

539
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,360
So the idea of the idea of the initials

540
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,280
of the original is that if it takes us a little bit too long,

541
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,040
since we started out in the beginning,

542
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,920
we're not as strong as we were in the beginning.

543
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,400
That's because we're not as strong as we were in the beginning.

544
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,800
And so it's a very good idea to do that first.

545
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,680
But it's the only way to do this is to do it in two seconds.

546
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,220
So one of the things that's important is to do it in two,

547
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,140
we don't, in the first segment is to choose the seventh

548
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,380
and the last part of the Holy Qur'an says

549
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,700
that he's allowed the Live completion of my life

550
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,720
in his就到头, so that's the last thing

551
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,320
that I've said, the~!!

552
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,400
I don't know what I'm supposed to say again.

553
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,120
And so the idea of the idea of the שלand ID ray

554
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,200
space is what that symbolizes.

555
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,860
And it doesn't have to say what developers that would

556
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,240
embrace

557
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,520
We agreed to change indigenous people like ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

558
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,900
Iknow lots of people are doubting that.

559
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,780
I've been reminded of your comments before!

560
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:37,780
There's a

561
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,780
massive

562
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,940
population,

563
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,360
an enormous

564
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,840
traffic gain,

565
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,120
This would state that it's within a piece of wood,

566
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:16,380
in an

567
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,360
entire piece of wood.

568
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,500
So there's socialization, there are am divorced marriages,

569
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,880
these are the parts of what you'd do to support that.

570
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,680
And then, biologically to help help

571
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,280
with the explosion there's the potentialöture

572
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,000
of participation of sexuality

573
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,900
and a pure way to lives,

574
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,440
and´麒麗 gener share how we can lead

575
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,920
可是 굉장히aras a hacer

576
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,040
What are they going to do, thusаш unable to participate?

577
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,280
We just don't have the freedom of choice or the resources

578
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,040
to participate in the Installation Plan or whatever

579
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,880
that you can find within this program.

580
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,020
We still have to work at it, as the project is going on

581
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,500
with the development of of the RYU teams in its ongoing

582
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,360
staff environment.

583
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,920
Right now, the staff comes together.

584
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,980
We could say we considering and we have a common sense

585
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,520
of how to build more SM здесь.

586
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:32,460
in the US, and he Yea've made the commitment that, and Akim said, one day, as having already

587
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:43,140
brought this opinion into into church I would, on the top of my head, I will react, but I

588
00:27:43,140 --> 00:28:02,080
The

589
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,380
So I think that's a good question.

590
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,220
And I think it's a good question, too.

591
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,020
And I think that's a good question.

592
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,180
And I think that's a good question.

593
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,020
And I think that's a good question.

594
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,780
And I think that's a good question.

595
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,700
And I think that's a good question.

596
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,700
And I think that's a good question.

597
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,260
And I think that's a good question.

598
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,500
And I think that's a good question.

599
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,820
And I think that's a good question.

600
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,900
And I think that's a good question.

601
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,820
And I think that's a good question.

602
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,100
And I think that's a good question.

603
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,300
And I think that's a good question.

604
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,900
And I think that's a good question.

605
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,100
And I think that's a good question.

606
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,340
And I think that's a good question.

607
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,220
And I think that's a good question.

608
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,380
So I think that's a good question.

609
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,300
I think that's a good question.

610
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,540
And I think that's a good question.

611
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,300
And I think that that's a good question.

612
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,580
OK, that's a good question.

613
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,500
I would like to finish in relation

614
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,380
to the question you just raised about diversity.

615
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,220
How can we do the이�?

616
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,940
We often think of this as, kind of,

617
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,460
it's simple.

618
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,540
But not dealing with diversity is what we certainly do.

619
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,700
We always Peter here as well, in thousands of people.

620
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,160
And we always talk about diversity

621
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,940
and we talk about diversity usually.

622
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,040
can deals with or works with social media sites to create local

623
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,860
content for those videos above.

624
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,920
Our students can share the videos with their friends

625
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,120
and family.

626
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,180
And here I'd like to talk about stuff

627
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:33,260
which, to my interest, will help

628
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:40,260
I'm sure that's a good question.

629
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,260
Thank you.

630
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,260
Thank you so much.

631
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,260
Thank you.
