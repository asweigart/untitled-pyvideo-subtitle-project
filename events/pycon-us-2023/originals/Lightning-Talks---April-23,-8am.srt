1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Good morning everybody.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,680
I told you I would sing.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,080
That's a lot of singing.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,240
I want to just say a huge thank you

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,400
because this is actually your first year helping running

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,400
Lightning Talks and you've been a fantastic co-MC.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,600
So just a round of applause for all of our volunteers here.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,880
Thank you so much.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,080
And also I thank you for like taking care of me

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,440
because you handle a lot of logistics and stuff

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,920
which I found it very confusing

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,760
because my brain is not working very well.

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,160
As you can tell, we have not sleep a lot during the conference.

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,760
Indeed, indeed.

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,720
So welcome to day three.

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,120
So what's on the agenda for today?

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,760
Well today, so it's kick off with a very amazing session

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,240
is the Lightning Talks session

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,120
but it's a very special session

20
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,400
because we will start off with not just your normal

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,440
Lightning Talks but with a community announcement

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,320
which you will see how it works.

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,400
It's like super quick, a lot of conference,

24
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,280
your mind will be blown by the end of it

25
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,120
because there's so many events.

26
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,960
Fantastic.

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,080
And then I also heard that there is a,

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,720
oh again, there's, if you did apply to do a Lightning Talk

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,160
and for some reason it didn't get selected,

30
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,720
today at noon there is an open source space.

31
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,240
I believe it's called the Lightning Talks

32
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,080
they didn't want you to hear.

33
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,360
So you can go check that out

34
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,600
or you could just go and listen to people talk

35
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,040
and trying to think about any other housekeeping items.

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,800
Oh, what about the sprints?

37
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,600
Yes, so please stay after the keynote today

38
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,360
at the last keynote today because at 5 p.m. at this room

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,520
because for those of you who have never been to the sprints

40
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,360
please come because there will be orientation

41
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,560
tell you what is a sprint, what project you can sprint on.

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,160
But those of you who have been to the sprint

43
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,720
also come here because then you will know

44
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,880
what project you can work on tomorrow.

45
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,840
Fantastic.

46
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,760
Well I think with that,

47
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,400
do you wanna go ahead and kick it off?

48
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,240
Yeah, sure.

49
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,960
So like I said, the first will be community announcements

50
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,120
so our first community speaker is here already

51
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,240
so they all only got like 30 seconds for each slide

52
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,400
so you have to be really paying attention

53
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,520
because they will be quick, okay?

54
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,480
So let's start now.

55
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,600
Hi, so my name is Felipe, my mom called me Felipe Aitan

56
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,320
and we're gonna host a conference in Brazil

57
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,720
and a conference focused on black people in IT

58
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,720
and if you wanna join, that's the date, 22 of July

59
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,080

60
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,680

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,200
and you are welcome to come to Brazil.

62
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,160
Bye bye, thank you.

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,660
Thank you so much.

64
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,480
And I'm here to talk about Python Brazil as well.

65
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,360
Python Brazil is the biggest Python conference in Brazil.

66
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,480
We get together all the local communities in Brazil

67
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,280
and go to this big PyCon that we have called

68
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,360
Python Brazil every year.

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,520
This year is gonna take place in Caxias do Sul

70
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,560
which is kind of like in the south.

71
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,080
We're a huge, warm, loving, welcoming community

72
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,400
of Python developers and we would like to invite you all

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,640
to attend and see it for yourself.

74
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,440
We're also looking for sponsors

75
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,440
so if your company is interested,

76
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,620
just like hit me up and yeah.

77
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,620
Hello, North Bay Python is the San Francisco Bay Area's

78
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,260
one track Python conference.

79
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,620
This year we're back after a three year break

80
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,380
returning to Petaluma, California,

81
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,820
just 35 miles north of San Francisco.

82
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,780
It'll be on July the 29th and 30th

83
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,580
before the Californian summer gets too harsh.

84
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,980
This year our venue is a barn on a 600 acre ranch.

85
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,940
There are cows and horses and friendly venue cats.

86
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,780
Our call for proposals is now open

87
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,340
and closes on Friday, May the 19th.

88
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,220
I'm also here to invite you to the southern most

89
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,620
Python conference in the world, Kiwi PyCon,

90
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,820
which is taking place this year in Waihupai in Vicargo

91
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
in Aotearoa, New Zealand.

92
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,860
It's at the far south of New Zealand

93
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,940
but you can make it there with just one connection

94
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,780
from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago,

95
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,460
Houston or New York, so super convenient.

96
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,380
The conference this year is on the 15th to 17th of September

97
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,500
which is the beginning of spring in the southern hemisphere.

98
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,060
If you want to take part, the call for proposals

99
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,700
is open from today until May the 19th

100
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,300
and if I've convinced you to come along,

101
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,340
there is a discount code right there on the slide.

102
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,560
So see you in Vicargo.

103
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,060
Hello, I'm Michael, I'm the organizer

104
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,900
of the Orlando Python Meetup.

105
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,060
There is a vibrant tech scene in Orlando,

106
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,580
it's more than just the theme parks.

107
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,340
So if you find yourself on vacation

108
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,340
and want to give a talk, we are always looking for speakers.

109
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,780
We will make a date work for you.

110
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,140
We'll create a meeting and we have a lot of our talks online.

111
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,140
You can reach me at pyorl.org and a lot of our past talks

112
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,700
can be found on YouTube at watch.pyorl.org.

113
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,620
Sorry, that's actually PyCon UK, so I'm representing them.

114
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,460
So PyCon UK is going back to the beautiful Cardiff City Hall

115
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,300
is actually like a historical building.

116
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,180
So if you have never been to a British historical

117
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,780
like Victorian style building, so this is your chance.

118
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,820
And it's in September 22nd.

119
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,660
So all the announcements, please check out their website.

120
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,820
I don't know when the CFP is open.

121
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,100
So next one also in the UK is,

122
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,340
but this time it's in other country technically

123
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,940
because it's in Scotland instead of in Wales.

124
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,300
So PyCon UK was the other one is in Wales.

125
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,020
This one, JungleCon is in Scotland,

126
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,180
is in 29th of May to 2nd of June is in Edinburgh.

127
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,420
Again, Edinburgh got a lot of beautiful castle.

128
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,140
So if you love beautiful country, beautiful castle,

129
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,500
beautiful things to do and drink a lot of whiskey,

130
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,380
then please come to JungleCon.

131
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,180
Next one.

132
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,020
Good morning.

133
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,500
I would like to invite you to a US IPI.

134
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,020
This is a European Conference for Python and Science.

135
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,300
It will be in the nice city of Basel in Switzerland.

136
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,500
We had this in the same place last year.

137
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,820
It's a very, very nice city.

138
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,420
It will be August 14 to 18.

139
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,740
We do have tutorials.

140
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,340
We have talks and we do have sprints.

141
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,660
We also have posters.

142
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,300
So the call for proposals is open to the end of the month.

143
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,140
So if you would like, you can still propose a talk,

144
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,300
a poster or a tutorial session.

145
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,260
See you in Basel.

146
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,300
Good morning.

147
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,500
After a brief absence, PyCon Australia is back this year

148
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,460
in Tandania, Adelaide, in the Adelaide Convention Center

149
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,580
on the banks of the Karawari Piri.

150
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,300
It is a multi-day conference,

151
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,620
a first day of specialist tracks,

152
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,180
incorporating an education track,

153
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,500
JungleCon Australia, all things data

154
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,020
and our connected universe.

155
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,180
Two days of regular tracks, including a PyCon fair,

156
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,820
and then two days of sprints.

157
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,020
Our call for papers is open right now

158
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,660
until the 14th of May.

159
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,060
For more details, PyCon.org.au.

160
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,900
Thank you.

161
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,700
Yeah, we love you.

162
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,620
Oh, sorry.

163
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,780
So this is PyGotham.

164
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,020
Also, I'm representing them.

165
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,060
So it's an online conference, so you don't have to travel.

166
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,620
You can see it from there.

167
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,380
You know, the domain is PyGotham.tv.

168
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,420
So they are very like a theme.

169
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,340
Then it's very cool.

170
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,740
So it's October 6 to 7, 2023.

171
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,380
So also, I think the CFP is open because there's a link there.

172
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,700
So check them out.

173
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,020
Next one.

174
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,860
So hello. We are Javi and Christian,

175
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,900
two of the organizers of this year's PyCon in Spain.

176
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,580
That takes place in the island.

177
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,740
If you are not aware of Tenerife in particular,

178
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,580
it's one of the most beautiful islands in the entire Europe.

179
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,300
We have beautiful beaches, a lot of nature to see and enjoy.

180
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,020
So yeah, this is a great opportunity.

181
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,860
As you see there, we will have an English talk as well.

182
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,780
So like here, we give space for people to speak Spanish.

183
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,060
There, we give space to people who speak in English.

184
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,780
So if you have any questions, please let us know.

185
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,580
That's the website.

186
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,980
And the call for paper ends in June 23rd.

187
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,300
All right.

188
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,620
I'm here for PyCon Taiwan.

189
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,220
So we timed it exactly right.

190
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,820
So it's too late for you to submit a proposal.

191
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,380
And it's too early for you to buy a ticket yet.

192
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,900
So what I want you to do now is just book this date

193
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,620
onto your schedule and just come.

194
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:41,140
And if the only problem stopping you is financialary

195
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,300
and not the long flights,

196
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,460
we do have financial aid programs that you can apply.

197
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,060
And we have everything you expect, good food, beer,

198
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,540
and occasionally conference talks.

199
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,500
And also something that you might not expect

200
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,620
that very exotic souvenirs and like live band performance

201
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,340
and things like that.

202
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,340
So yeah, we'll come with that.

203
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,020
Good morning.

204
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,740
My name is Lisa.

205
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,260
And I'm one of the organizers for Pyjamas,

206
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,300
the laziest conference on earth.

207
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,860
It is now in its fourth year.

208
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,020
And it's a 24-hour online conference

209
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,100
for all ranges of Python users.

210
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,540
It is free to attend.

211
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,300
But we encourage small donations

212
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,740
with all proceeds going to the PSF.

213
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,460
We're always looking for more volunteers

214
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,420
and organizers, more diversity.

215
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,660
So if you're looking for a conference you can watch

216
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,380
in your pajamas, go to our website, Pyjamas.live.

217
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,580
We're also on Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and look

218
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,660
out for our call for proposals soon.

219
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,940
Thank you.

220
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,780
Okay, so this is me again, EuroPython.

221
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,900
So this year, EuroPython will be in Prague,

222
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,300
a very beautiful city.

223
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,820
I really love castles and like churches.

224
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,060
So that's why I can tell you I've been there in the castle

225
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,700
and churches there are amazing.

226
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,020
A lot of art.

227
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,540
And also it's in July, so weather will be nice, 17 to 23.

228
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,180
So check out the website.

229
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,900
And next one is PyCon Uganda.

230
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,020
So we have a new PyCon in Africa.

231
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,140
So for those of you who may not know,

232
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,060
there are actually PyCons in Africa, in different countries.

233
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,220
So this is a new one.

234
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,220
So if you go there, it could be your first PyCon in Africa.

235
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,340
So you know, it is their first as well.

236
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,100
So call for paper is now open.

237
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,940
Check out their website.

238
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,700
And PyBay Area Python Association.

239
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,020
So this slide also sent in by the organizers.

240
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,940
So these are the amazing, you know, user group

241
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,140
or communities that you can join.

242
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,900
So there are a few of them.

243
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,620
If you live around the area, please check them out

244
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,420
and join the events.

245
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,700
PyTexas.

246
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,420
Hello, my name is Mason, and I'm the organizer for PyTexas.

247
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,780
You just missed PyTexas.

248
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,540
It was three weeks ago.

249
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,780
But we already have next year's date, so we're good for that.

250
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,300
It's April 20th and 21st, 2024.

251
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,420
It'll be at the Austin Central Library in Austin, Texas.

252
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,140
Our CFP will be opening in Q4 of this year.

253
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,420
So keep an eye out for it.

254
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,220
And if you want to keep in contact with what's going on,

255
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,420
please follow us on all the socials

256
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,020
or join our mailing list,

257
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,460
and that's how we'll get the information to you.

258
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,740
Thank you.

259
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:23,340
Good morning.

260
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:31,740
I'm Rina Kataeo, the chairperson of PyCon APOC 2023 in Japan.

261
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:38,420
This year, the Japan team is organizing a conference

262
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,460
as PyCon APOC.

263
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:48,300
The dates are October 27th to 29th, Tokyo, Japan.

264
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,780
Now call for proper now open.

265
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:57,780
This will be given in English and in Japanese, of course.

266
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:06,740
I hope that it is about half in English and half in Japanese.

267
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,820
Our team would like to make this conference more

268
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,260
international than last year.

269
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,340
Please take this opportunity to visit the Pacific

270
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,380
and to please come to Japan.

271
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,660
Thank you.

272
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,980
Hi, I'm Ben.

273
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,060
I'm the chair, one of the co-chairs of PyCascades,

274
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,980
which is a regional conference in the Cascade region.

275
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,340
We are back in Seattle in 2024.

276
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,260
You may notice a lack of detail on this slide,

277
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
but you might have questions like what are the dates,

278
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
what's the venue, when's the CFP open,

279
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,260
and when do ticket sales open?

280
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,260
The answer to all of those questions and more

281
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,220
is to be determined, but you can help.

282
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,100
We are currently looking for organizers.

283
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,260
If you would like to help, you can email us

284
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,140
at organizers at PyCascades.com.

285
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,500
We're on all the socials as PyCascades,

286
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,740
and we are on mastodon at PyCascades at fostodon.org.

287
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,340
Thanks.

288
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,940
You shouldn't miss PyCascades.

289
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,780
Highly recommend it, but I'm going to tell you about another conference

290
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,580
that you shouldn't miss either.

291
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,580
It's the PyCon Latam.

292
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,580
My name is Andres.

293
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,540
She's Denny, and we are part of the PyCon Latam organizers.

294
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,700
This year, PyCon Latam is going to Monterey on August 24th, 26th.

295
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,140
There are four keynotes, two conference days, two tracks,

296
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,780
one in Spanish, one in English, a whole weekend

297
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,060
with all the PyCon enthusiasts.

298
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,220
But who's PyCon Latam?

299
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,060
Basically, we are the ones bringing PyCon awesomeness

300
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,940
to the Latin America communities.

301
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,780
And we have a big surprise for you.

302
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:49,140
We have a super early bird ticket available in this QR code.

303
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,260
Please go and enjoy.

304
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,580
Thank you.

305
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,100
And that is all the community announcements.

306
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,500
Thank you.

307
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,820
Fantastic.

308
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,420
So I've been to some of these conferences,

309
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,420
and they're really, really amazing.

310
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,540
I actually used to run a few years ago lightning talks at PyCascades.

311
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,860
So it's a slippery slope.

312
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,540
If you love volunteering, you can start at a regional conference

313
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,300
and then wind up up here one day.

314
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,500
So choose your own adventure.

315
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,980
But to kick off our lightning talk section now, we're going to go ahead

316
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,100
and kick it over to Greg, who's going to be talking to us a little bit

317
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,740
about Python and education.

318
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,140
Good morning.

319
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,780
That's all right.

320
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,100
Good morning.

321
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,540
I'm Greg Dante, and I'm here to talk about education, and in particular,

322
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,380
PCBL, which is personal competency-based learning.

323
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,020
I'll explain a little bit more about that.

324
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,060
First off, I'm from Kansas City, so clap if you're a Kansas City fan.

325
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,500
I knew it.

326
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,780
That's everyone.

327
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,100
Just a quick background on myself.

328
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,620
This is the little dance that I did for about 20 years plus of my career.

329
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,500
And then in terms of kind of just a quick personal view, this is some

330
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,700
of the roles that I play in life.

331
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,700
And then some of my hobbies, and as I look at this, I don't actually live

332
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,860
into any of these, so these are more aspirations, but I'm working on it.

333
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,020
And what am I doing now?

334
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,260
I'm a first-year educator, so I went from industry into education,

335
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,540
and I teach at a STEM school that focuses on prepping students

336
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,500
for the real world and real world learning.

337
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,820
So this is a sample of them at Summit Technology Academy,

338
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,020
where I work with a number of other teachers.

339
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,380
And we have 36 of them that came out to this conference,

340
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,940
and they're high school juniors and seniors.

341
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,820
So if you see anyone wearing the sort of STA polo, please introduce yourself.

342
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:41,540
So my big sort of when all you have is a hammer, everything's a nail moment,

343
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,340
is that courses are just projects in my mind when I take a look at them.

344
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,300
So as a first-year teacher, I just mapped everything

345
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,020
from what I was doing to education.

346
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:56,100
So when I see objectives and learnings, I just think of tickets and requirements

347
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,060
that go through a workflow, and especially one in, say, like a Kanban-type board

348
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,980
and visualization, and they're sized and estimated,

349
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,900
and you can work them in different priorities.

350
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,100
I see sprints, two-week sprints and iterations and percent completes

351
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,820
and deliverability of items otherwise called units in education,

352
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:20,900
but they kind of map into the same sort of concepts for projects for me, milestones.

353
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,660
And then the idea of visualizing how much is done, how much is left,

354
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,420
and just being able to see what's in the backlog and to prioritize backlogs.

355
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:37,140
So conveniently, all of these things were in GitHub, and GitHub also conveniently is

356
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,980
in the list of approved items that we can use as educators.

357
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,860
So why first PCBI said personal competency-based learning,

358
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,780
and it's a little bit more of a forward-thinking view into education,

359
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,340
so it's nontraditional, but big surprise, it's personalized.

360
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,460
And what that means is that it's individual to the student, and they can sort of self-pace

361
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,020
and grapple with the material in the way that's meaningful to them

362
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,540
and also align to their identity.

363
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,220
And then the focus of it is more on competency, not on grades,

364
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,460
and about sort of assessing that.

365
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,060
So in my classes, I have students that are really experienced and students

366
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:19,180
that are brand new, and to force them through kind of a sequenced curriculum

367
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,900
at the same pace just doesn't make sense.

368
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,980
And then why GitHub?

369
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,060
Well, because so many people use it.

370
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,460
Everything I've seen here, it's just everyone's sharing GitHub,

371
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,100
so why shouldn't students work in GitHub?

372
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,260
And the other nice thing is that with GitHub projects, I can orchestrate the classroom

373
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:40,620
as well as code and tie those things together to produce evidence of learning and competency.

374
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,940
And then students get to invest in their own portfolio, their own repos,

375
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,740
and then also build activity that they can showcase to employers in the future.

376
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,780
And why Python?

377
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,940
I just learned Python probably in the last three, four months,

378
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,980
so I'm brand new to it.

379
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,980
I'm mostly .NET and Java and PHP based.

380
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,340
But I've loved it so far.

381
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,580
I love it so much that it basically is my go-to now for programming.

382
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,060
It's expressive and it has a lot of the libraries that were necessary to build this,

383
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,220
and it's loved universally by students and teachers.

384
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,500
So it's working for me right now.

385
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,100
And then why Google Sheets?

386
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,740
As I moved from developer to manager, my IDE became Excel.

387
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,060
And I know that's not cool, but it actually is super powerful,

388
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:32,380
really helpful and easy for filtering data, for being able to kind of write formulas.

389
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,500
And it's my database.

390
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
And for this prototype, it worked really, really well.

391
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,380
So this is just like one type of view where I can actually go and look and

392
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,180
filter by students.

393
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,620
And you can see down at the bottom, there's courses, course sprints,

394
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,460
course units, course objectives, and those are all sort of just the database tables

395
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,020
of sorts that end up being recreated and modeled into GitHub.

396
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,260
And I can go in and check things as assessed, and

397
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,460
it moves tickets to done, closes tickets, and so on.

398
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,380
So there's a number of libraries, Google API, Python library,

399
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:11,980
PyGitHub for the REST API of Git, and then the GraphQL for GitHub is critical too.

400
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:17,980
So then we get these beautiful sort of aggregate views of student performance.

401
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:23,180
And as you can see, along these lines, students are underperforming,

402
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,660
but that's just because we just launched it.

403
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,580
And again, this is our group, 36 students, say hello.

404
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,100
Thank you.

405
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:39,660
It's a very long runway, sorry about that.

406
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,460
I'm sprinting now.

407
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,940
Talk about sprints, remember to stay for the sprint orientation today.

408
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,460
So our next talk, we'll have Adam,

409
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,580
who is the first time attending PyCon and he's now giving a lightning talk.

410
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,260
Thank you so much.

411
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,220
Hi everyone.

412
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,380
Hello, my name is Adam Silke.

413
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,260
I'm an empathetic leader and technologist.

414
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,900
First time PyCon and I've got a lovely new tie thanks to Pi ladies, so

415
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,780
yay Pi ladies.

416
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,220
This is a photo of me winning an ugly sweater contest.

417
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,500
And yes, I know what some of you are thinking, that's not a sweater.

418
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,780
Don't worry, the year after that, they explicitly called out only sweaters.

419
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,580
You know, explicit is better than implicit.

420
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,620
Anyway, this is leadership and the zen of Python.

421
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,500
There's a thesis to my five minutes up here, it's this.

422
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,540
Be present and lead with empathy.

423
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,540
It's that wonderful quote by Maya Angelou, people will forget what you said,

424
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,220
people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made

425
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,740
them feel.

426
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,420
I, like many others, was recently caught up in the ongoing layoffs that are

427
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,860
affecting our industry.

428
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,060
And a senior leader who I rarely interacted with reached out and said, hey,

429
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,500
checking in, I'd like to set up some time to talk.

430
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
And I said, yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

431
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,140
And four weeks later, I walked out of the workplace on my last day, never having

432
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,300
had that conversation.

433
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,740
People will never forget how you made them feel.

434
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,980
More than ever, we need leadership in our industry.

435
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,820
And I truly believe that Pythonistas make for perfect leaders.

436
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,540
After all, we have the zen of Python.

437
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,220
Beautiful is better than ugly, explicit is better than implicit, simple is

438
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,020
better than complex, complex is better than complicated, and so on.

439
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,860
But the problem with humans is that we're complicated, and

440
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:29,020
our thoughts are implicit, and our emotions are messy and sometimes even ugly.

441
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,140
So what can you do as a leader?

442
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,220
Be present and lead with empathy.

443
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,100
Beautiful is better than ugly, but messy happens, so learn to love it.

444
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,260
Dig into the messiness of people, and I promise you'll discover beauty there that

445
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:48,420
you never expected to find, and it will make all your relationships better.

446
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,340
Explicit is better than implicit, but people are 90% implicit at least.

447
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,300
It's that old conversation, hey, how are you doing?

448
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,700
Fine.

449
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,140
They're not fine.

450
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,620
So your goal as a leader is to learn to read the implicit, to listen and

451
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,940
lead with empathy, and give your people the space to be explicit with what they

452
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:12,780
want, and how they feel, and who they are, because explicit is better than implicit.

453
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:17,100
And people may be complicated, yes, but as Ned so

454
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,420
eloquently pointed out on Friday, so are you.

455
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,980
Understanding starts with you.

456
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,820
There was this one time that one of my employees gave me a call, and he said, hey,

457
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,460
man, I need to take the day, and I could tell immediately that there was something

458
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:35,620
wrong, and what's more, I remember being in his spot before where managers

459
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,620
interrogating me saying, well, what's going on?

460
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,940
And I didn't want to be that person, so I said, you got it, man, you take care of you,

461
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,340
take as much time as you need, and I'll take care of everything.

462
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,020
He told me two days later that the reason he needed time was because his dog had

463
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,220
suddenly gotten ill and passed away.

464
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,740
And the day that I found out that I had been let go, he gave me a call and said,

465
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,460
man, the reason I've stayed all these years is because of you.

466
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,780
People will never forget how you made them feel.

467
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,460
Let me give you one more story.

468
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,860
It was the middle of a major production issue, not my fault, but I was responsible

469
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,340
for helping to fix it.

470
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:18,220
And I'd been on site for 20 hours, and one of my leaders, the one who actually

471
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,100
introduced Python to me, had been there the whole time.

472
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,140
And he was doing the typical leader thing, not a whole lot except reading emails and

473
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,700
going to meetings and having really important phone calls.

474
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,100
And I told him, hey, man, you've been here a long time, just go home.

475
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,220
And I will never forget what he said.

476
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,060
You're here, so I'm here.

477
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,140
So be there.

478
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,720
Thank you.

479
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,420
Thank you so much, Adam.

480
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,140
Speaking of the Pilates auction, I think we raised over $36,000.

481
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,660
Amazing, right?

482
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,700
So there was things like ties.

483
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,620
People decided collectively to bid on pens, just like random pens we had.

484
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:10,740
There was Python set, fine China for a set of six and Dev Proof, which was a loan

485
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,300
kit. There was a lot of really cool stuff.

486
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,660
So if you haven't been to the Pilates auction in the past, please, please, please

487
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,380
consider it if you're going to be coming in the future to PyCon US.

488
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,620
It's a really good time.

489
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,900
But anyways, our next Lightning Talk speaker, Mariano, is going to be talking

490
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,060
about some work that I'm really, really excited about.

491
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,420
I've been reading about what this community has been up to for a while.

492
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,420
So why don't you go ahead and take it away?

493
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,300
Welcome. I'm Mariano from Python Argentina.

494
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:40,620
And we're talking about some project that we have there.

495
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:51,020
The first one is a course to teach Python to all kinds of students from high

496
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,140
school to adults.

497
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,540
And it's a remake of our original course of Brazil.

498
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:04,500
This course was just videos and exercises that you have to download and run in your

499
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,660
local computer.

500
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:13,100
And what we do is to create an online course using Ronstone.

501
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:22,260
That is a Python platform where teachers can out-or-the-work the lessons.

502
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,980
So this runs completely in the browser.

503
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,700
You don't have to install Python.

504
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:33,980
You can run it in a tablet, in a cell phone, even offline with no internet

505
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,820
connection or with high latency.

506
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:44,700
And also this has zero cost for hosting because you don't need a server to run the

507
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:51,260
exercises. Here is the online version if you want to try.

508
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:02,660
You have simple exercises to start Hello World programs.

509
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:08,980
And also some quizzes that have unit tests.

510
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:17,780
So you will give immediate feedback if your exercise is correct or you need to fix it.

511
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,500
And you also have visualization of the program step by step.

512
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,220
This is for students that want to learn how the program is run.

513
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,220
You have more traditional activities.

514
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:38,020
And what we do is also adding a new interpreter that is called Brighton.

515
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
That is Python in JavaScript.

516
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,260
And this supports a lot of features.

517
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:50,580
We work in, for example, SQLite wrapper to run databases and Pygame.

518
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,500
So you can run games directly in the browser.

519
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:00,100
This is an example of the queries you can do with the SQLite.

520
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,900
And it's regular Python.

521
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:13,060
Also you can do web UI with bots and dialogues so the student can have a vision of everything.

522
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:23,020
And this is the last challenge that is writing a game with Pygame.

523
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:32,980
So the student also can try to practice and edit the game and just press run.

524
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,380
And this will run in the browser without installation.

525
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:45,300
And the only difference with a traditional Pygame is this line that we need to do for JavaScript

526
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,740
that you cannot block the browser and so on.

527
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,860
But anyway, we have another project in Argentina.

528
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:57,460
This is a web service for the government library.

529
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:05,900
And all of this project participated in the Google Summer of Code.

530
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:13,860
That is a grant program of Google that pays students and students to work in open source projects.

531
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:24,020
So if any one of you are interested to start to collaborate and learn how open source is developed and so on,

532
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,060
you can try to join and make a proposal.

533
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,580
We are working under the Python Software Foundation umbrella.

534
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,460
Here's the link.

535
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:42,220
And you can also join to our Telegram group for this that has the information.

536
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,700
We do the announcements and news.

537
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,860
And these are some students.

538
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:54,980
I was a student of the Google Summer of Code program a lot of years ago.

539
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:03,940
Then we have Nicolás also was a student and now he's a mentor and active collaborator of our community.

540
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:09,340
And we have a lot of students from Argentina and other countries.

541
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,900
And here are the links.

542
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,420
If you want to talk about this, I will be on the screen the next day.

543
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,660
So you can learn.

544
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,500
We need better tests and so on.

545
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,740
So thank you for your time.

546
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,500
Why is it so far away?

547
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,140
Okay.

548
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,900
Thank you so much for the talk about the game, right?

549
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,340
I think, sorry, I wasn't made of it.

550
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,500
I haven't slept enough.

551
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,060
Okay.

552
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:44,300
So the next talk is Ali will be presenting about.

553
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,180
Oh, I can't read that.

554
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,740
Can you explain please?

555
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,020
Thank you.

556
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,540
The stage is yours.

557
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,340
Cool.

558
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,780
Thank you.

559
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,540
Yeah, my name is Alastair, aka Ali.

560
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:59,020
And I just want to talk about something cool that I've been doing the last few days.

561
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,820
I think it's cool at least.

562
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:08,020
Started on Friday morning when I was trying to think of topics for a lightning talk and saw this logo pop up.

563
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,420
On a slide.

564
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,380
It was kind of.

565
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,540
It had this nice kind of mirror symmetry to it.

566
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:19,340
I was thinking, oh, could you write some Python code that had the same mirror image symmetry?

567
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,060
And I realized I'm talking about palindromes.

568
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,140
So can you write Python code that is a palindrome?

569
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,260
Yeah, it's very difficult to search for this.

570
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,020
So I have no idea if anyone's done it before.

571
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:36,020
Just spits out Python palindrome checker algorithms.

572
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:40,620
So by Friday afternoon, I gave up on that and decided I'm just going to try and do it myself.

573
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,460
So I'm going to show you what I came up with.

574
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,060
Yeah, my second example is a bit more interesting than that.

575
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,860
Slightly more interesting.

576
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,820
Yeah, this one still doesn't do anything, but at least illustrates the point that for our case,

577
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,100
palindromes are going to be ignoring white space.

578
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,140
Otherwise, it's really difficult.

579
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,260
So what about a program that actually does something?

580
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,740
Can this be made palindromic?

581
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,780
Yeah, of course.

582
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,220
Obviously, this one's cheating a bit.

583
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:22,140
So I'm going to say we're also going to ignore comments.

584
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:27,620
And well done if you noticed that is actually not a palindrome.

585
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,900
Because the brackets don't match.

586
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,860
We're matching an open bracket with a closed bracket.

587
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,780
And just because they're mirror images doesn't mean it's a palindrome.

588
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,940
So we need to flip those around.

589
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,900
Now it's a palindrome.

590
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,140
But also expose as a problem with brackets we're going to have going forward.

591
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,060
If we have code that has any brackets in it at all, the first one is going to be an open bracket,

592
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:53,300
which means the last one also has to be an open bracket and that's not going to fly.

593
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,860
So bye bye brackets, I guess.

594
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,820
So let's take it all the way back.

595
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,860
The simplest sort of operations we can think of, variable assignment.

596
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,300
Can we do them?

597
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:12,260
This is problematic because when we flip it around,

598
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,860
we're going to end up with something like this on the other end

599
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,460
and we can't have an integer on the left side of the assignment.

600
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,220
Same with strings and that sort of thing.

601
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,860
But complex numbers to the rescue.

602
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,900
1j is square root of minus 1, j1 is just a variable name

603
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,860
that happens to equal square root of minus 1 here.

604
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,220
Yeah.

605
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,140
We can do lambdas.

606
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,020
They don't need brackets.

607
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:42,300
But unfortunately, if you try and do anything useful or interesting with them at all,

608
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,780
you run into cases where you need to use brackets and it kind of falls apart.

609
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:53,180
So maybe class declarations work.

610
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,100
We can put in some type hints.

611
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,620
That's fine.

612
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,140
But all of these are parts of ideas and not really coming together

613
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,500
into something useful as a code.

614
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:08,060
So I cleared my head on Saturday morning in the mountains

615
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:13,540
with these wonderful people and came back and wrote that thing.

616
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:20,500
So ignore the actual function declaration at the top, the line at the top,

617
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,700
but the rest of it from lines to onwards is a palindrome.

618
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:29,860
And it's fine if it's not clear what it does at first.

619
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,620
But those are the actually useful bits.

620
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:37,500
The rest is just sort of filling to make it palindromic.

621
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:41,660
And just show you quickly what it outputs.

622
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,140
If you print the first couple of things from the generator.

623
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,900
Technically Fibonacci.

624
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,340
Admittedly, the outputs formatted a bit unusually.

625
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,900
I could clean up and get rid of those zero J complex number bits,

626
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,660
but I stopped there.

627
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,460
I had my sights on something bigger.

628
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,100
Can I write a palindromic palindrome checker?

629
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,500
And even without making a palindrome,

630
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,740
trying to do this without using brackets to index into a string

631
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,460
or a reverse function is kind of tricky.

632
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,780
It's not obvious at first how you would do it.

633
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,060
But you can.

634
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:26,620
And once again, I'll highlight the actual useful bit of that for you.

635
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,820
Feel free to have a look.

636
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,860
I've got stuff on GitHub afterwards.

637
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,580
And I think I've created something that's even harder to search

638
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,580
than what I initially had, which was quite nice.

639
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,220
The next stage is creating a palindrome Turing machine

640
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,500
implementation in Python.

641
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,700
So if you want to help me with that, please get in touch.

642
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:52,300
Okay, I'll admit when I was looking at some of that, I'm like,

643
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,940
I know it's early, but what am I looking at?

644
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,900
So fantastic, fantastic talk.

645
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,220
Thank you so much for that.

646
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,940
Our next lightning talk speaker is JR,

647
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,740
and they're going to go ahead and take it away.

648
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,500
Thank you very much.

649
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,100
Good morning, PyCon US.

650
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,220
So I'm JR Rickerson.

651
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:17,380
I've been doing Python for a while, and for around the last 10 years or so,

652
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,300
I've also been teaching Python in various capacities,

653
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,740
like professionally and as a volunteer sometimes.

654
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:28,060
And teaching Python has taught me a lot about Python, right?

655
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,740
You actually learn quite a bit when you're teaching.

656
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,060
I don't have any slides, thank you.

657
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,180
And so I'm going to talk to you a little bit about what I've learned

658
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,700
and what I've learned about learning.

659
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,060
So I don't have any slides for you.

660
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,420
I don't have any live code.

661
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,020
I just have ideas.

662
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,580
So we'll talk about a few of those,

663
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,300
and hopefully I can provide some perspective on things.

664
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,220
So I'm going to talk a little bit about playing games.

665
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,380
That is something that hopefully you have done before, right?

666
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,620
Who here has never been a child?

667
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,580
Right? Probably nobody.

668
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:06,140
And who here has never played any sort of a game?

669
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,100
Right? Pretend, sports games, board games, whatever.

670
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,740
It's a universal kind of thing.

671
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,220
Everybody plays games.

672
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,540
And it's one of the few things we can kind of all agree on.

673
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:23,100
It doesn't matter where you come from, your financial situation,

674
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,220
kids play games, right?

675
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,620
And we play games for a reason.

676
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,340
One of those reasons is to learn things,

677
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,540
to mimic adults that we see,

678
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:38,940
and try to figure out how to be bigger humans, essentially.

679
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,460
So why do children play games?

680
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,660
Well, it's kind of wired into our brains, I think, right?

681
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:51,220
It's one of those things that you just don't have to be really taught.

682
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,860
Even babies start playing games

683
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,100
to learn how to physically move around, right?

684
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:01,020
How to control their arms and legs and so forth.

685
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,180
And then as we go on, we learn things like rules.

686
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,460
We learn things like social interactions.

687
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,340
And we learn how to control our emotions, right?

688
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,460
Winning is joyous sometimes.

689
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,020
Losing is maybe not so much joyous in a game.

690
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,980
So we learn to kind of deal with that sort of thing.

691
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,860
And it's an effective form of learning for us

692
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,700
because it is tied into emotions, right?

693
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,980
We remember things that have strong emotions associated with them.

694
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,420
We remember the good times.

695
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,740
We remember the especially bad times.

696
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,620
And so games can kind of provide that for us.

697
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,900
Playing can kind of provide that for us.

698
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,260
And they're just fun, right?

699
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,100
There's some motivation there.

700
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,060
If we enjoy a game, if we have goals and rewards,

701
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,740
short cycles of things, it's fun,

702
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,900
and it keeps us motivated to keep doing that same thing.

703
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,780
Excuse me.

704
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,020
So as we get to be adults,

705
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:07,180
I think we start to forget how to play, right?

706
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:11,100
We become a little more inflexible in our learning,

707
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,420
in the way we do things.

708
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,740
We don't have time to play, right?

709
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,820
The 12 hours a day I used to play NES or something

710
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,140
has turned into 30 minutes once a month, something like that.

711
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,780
And so we just kind of forget.

712
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,740
We fall out of that pattern.

713
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,980
And we turn to serious business.

714
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:38,180
So what I'm here to say is, during my teaching of Python,

715
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,180
I've tried to encourage that, playing, right?

716
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,500
I've tried to use games as a way to learn, right?

717
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,140
Even something as simple for someone

718
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,300
who's never programmed before,

719
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:54,340
something as simple as guessing the number game, right?

720
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,500
Pick a number between zero and 100 and guess what it is.

721
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:02,460
Everybody can kind of understand that right off the bat,

722
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,500
and you can use that to teach coding concepts, right?

723
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,260
You can teach conditionals, you can teach rules,

724
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,100
you can teach types and that sort of thing.

725
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,660
And then you can kind of expand on that idea.

726
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,780
So I've tried to encourage that in my students,

727
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,540
and I think it's been a pretty effective way to learn

728
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,140
that we kind of naturally have built into us,

729
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,340
but we tend to forget as we get older.

730
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,340
So this is a Python conference, obviously.

731
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:38,220
What should you do with this information, right?

732
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,140
Well, you probably came here

733
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,900
with maybe a goal to learn something or meet someone.

734
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,020
Maybe you learned something new while you've been here

735
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,820
that you're now interested in learning.

736
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,660
So instead of resorting to serious business

737
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,060
and going and digging into it,

738
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,060
go find a way to play with it, right?

739
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,460
And go find people to play with it, right?

740
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,500
So enjoy.

741
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,580
OK, this time I start running early,

742
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,100
but I'm still a bit late to start early.

743
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,460
OK, so thank you for the talk.

744
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,020
And the next talk is actually something that I think is,

745
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,500
well, it's fun at the beginning and then it's very frustrating.

746
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,260
It's about web scraping.

747
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,780
So thank you and please take us away.

748
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,300
All righty. Hey, everyone.

749
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,940
My name is Lubo, and I'd like to tell you

750
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,900
about my first web scraping project,

751
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,260
my web scraping woe and the workaround that I found.

752
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,340
The goal of my project was to scrape information

753
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,260
from a website after being logged in.

754
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,980
This was a website that I cared about.

755
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,700
I wanted to keep my account,

756
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,380
so I wanted to play it as safe as possible.

757
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,380
The tool that I ended up choosing was PyAutoGUI,

758
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,660
a Python module by Al Swigert.

759
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,980
It allows us to control the mouse and keyboard programmatically.

760
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,820
And so we can, with Python, move the mouse,

761
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,900
click the keyboard and interact with the browser,

762
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,140
just like a real user.

763
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,220
This is a demo of the workflow that I came up with.

764
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,780
I'm combining PyAutoGUI with Beautiful Soup,

765
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,540
another Python package.

766
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,860
We're importing our packages, alt-tabbing over

767
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,340
so that the browser's in focus.

768
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,300
We click control-S as a hotkey so we can save the file locally.

769
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,620
Here we're interacting with the operating system GUI.

770
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,300
We open up the file, pass it into Beautiful Soup,

771
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,780
which parses our HTML,

772
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,220
and then we can extract whatever we want

773
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,860
from that local copy of the website.

774
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,020
Great for most of the pages that I came across

775
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,380
until I came across this one.

776
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,620
At first it doesn't look too bad.

777
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,820
We have a table.

778
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,780
Some of the rows are always visible,

779
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,460
and clicking on the visible row

780
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,140
toggles the visibility of the row beneath it.

781
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,020
The problem becomes apparent when we look at the HTML, though.

782
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,740
Here we're looking at the first question and answer pair.

783
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,180
Favorite color is present,

784
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,660
but this is when the page is first loaded.

785
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,460
The answer isn't present.

786
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,340
It's only after we click it that the answer gets populated,

787
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,260
and then it stays in the web page after that.

788
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,260
The workflow that I showed earlier does not work.

789
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,500
If we save the web page locally,

790
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,980
the information I want is not going to be there.

791
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,140
What made this more challenging as well

792
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,020
is that this table is part of a larger web page.

793
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,300
I didn't want all of the rows.

794
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,900
I didn't know how many rows there would be

795
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,220
when I first loaded it anyway.

796
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,700
Those were all things that made this tricky.

797
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,660
Here's the workaround that I came up with.

798
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,140
The first step is to use our existing method

799
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,860
to download the page and extract the text from the links.

800
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,620
Since I don't want all of the rows,

801
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,660
this allows me to know, from the link text,

802
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,940
I can tell which rows I want and which I don't.

803
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,940
The next step is to take a screenshot of the table.

804
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,780
This is using another Python package,

805
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,740
mss, or multiple screenshot.

806
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,380
I need that screenshot so that I can pass it

807
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,020
into an optical character recognition package,

808
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,380
easy OCR.

809
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,620
This takes that image and tries to identify each word.

810
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,660
It tells us what it thinks the string is,

811
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,260
how confident it is from zero to one,

812
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,420
and crucially, where it is in the image.

813
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,540
So it gives us coordinates of the bounding box.

814
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:11,740
Here it's per word, but I wanted per row

815
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,780
so we can join up those bounding boxes.

816
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:19,140
Now we have the text that the OCR package

817
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,500
thinks is in the links.

818
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,740
Notice it's mostly the same,

819
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:26,500
except the question marks are now the number two.

820
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,540
Now, in the example that I gave,

821
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,340
the OCR text is pretty close.

822
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,540
The font is quite large.

823
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,140
There aren't a ton of special characters,

824
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,020
but sometimes the output of the OCR is less than ideal.

825
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:43,540
So I need a way to match the rows that I want from step one

826
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,660
with the bounding boxes from step three.

827
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,540
And for this, I used another Python package

828
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,980
called the fuzz.

829
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,580
It implements Levenstein string distance,

830
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:56,340
which sounds fancy, but it's one metric of many to compute,

831
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,180
give a number to, how similar or dissimilar

832
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,140
two strings are from each other.

833
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,340
And I'd like to show you an example.

834
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,220
So here we're comparing the stuff from step one

835
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,780
through step three, favorite color versus the OCR version,

836
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,140
and we get a score of 93 out of 100.

837
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,540
Okay, if we compare it against the other one,

838
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,500
against favorite food, we get a lower score, 76.

839
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,180
If we compare it against nonsense,

840
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,780
we get 17.

841
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,220
And I'll note that you have to be empirical about this.

842
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,860
There's no one number.

843
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,860
So in my case, I had to play around with the strings

844
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,180
a little bit and find a number that allowed me

845
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,780
to separate matches from not matches.

846
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,180
And once we've done that, we can match the stuff extracted

847
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,460
from steps one and three, take those bounding boxes,

848
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,340
compute the center, click each of those,

849
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,180
and from there, our normal method works beautifully.

850
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:48,100
We save the web page locally and pass it into beautiful soup.

851
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,780
Big thanks to all the people who maintain these packages.

852
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,540
It would not have been possible without them.

853
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,980
And thank you for your time.

854
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,020
APPLAUSE

855
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,820
Excellent.

856
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,700
Thank you so much for that talk.

857
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:06,500
And our final lightning talk of PyCon 2023

858
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,860
will be telling us a little bit about simplifying pandas.

859
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,900
Take it away.

860
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,860
All right.

861
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,340
Hi, my name is Hao Sun.

862
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,740
Very happy to be here.

863
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,900
If you see me in the hallway, please say hi.

864
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,300
So today I'll be talking about simplifying pandas.

865
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,940
This is for all your data science people out there

866
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,340
and anybody who's trying to learn

867
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:30,020
getting into data science, data analysis.

868
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,740
And what I like to call this is data agnostic data analysis.

869
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:38,980
So the question is why?

870
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,580
Because life could be so much easier.

871
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,540
So I'm going to present to you an idea

872
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:46,100
that's going to change your life and how you view data analysis.

873
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,540
Once you see this, you can never unsee it like one of those memes.

874
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,220
But right now there's no open source code that you can play with.

875
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,900
But you can dream about it at night or at work

876
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,740
when you're crunching away at data analysis.

877
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,620
So what does it mean by data agnostic?

878
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,740
So basically I want to separate the logic from the data.

879
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:11,300
So basically when the logic is not changing,

880
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,340
when the data changes.

881
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,620
So what is logic? What is data?

882
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,500
It depends. It's a little bit subjective.

883
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:20,060
Something that changes could be considered data.

884
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,020
If it's across different iterations of your building,

885
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:26,420
your feature, different features, different projects, different teams,

886
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,780
or even different data storage medium.

887
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,660
So this is a little prelude to later.

888
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,100
And it's a little bit subjective.

889
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:39,220
But with the next two examples, I hope you'll get a better idea.

890
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,740
So consider the following scenario.

891
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,620
You want to get into stock trading

892
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:47,420
and you want to calculate the seven day average price for a stock, stock A.

893
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,340
OK, so looks innocuous enough.

894
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:53,420
You jump into penless and start calculating this.

895
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,980
But let's go back a step.

896
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:00,660
So can we separate this into data and logic, right?

897
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:06,620
So here the data is highlighted in blue and logic is highlighted in green.

898
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,100
So really the only logic you have is average.

899
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,220
Everything else is pretty much data that can change.

900
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,260
For example, you might not want a seven day average.

901
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,620
You might want a one month average.

902
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,980
Maybe you don't want an average price.

903
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,620
You want to average volume.

904
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,340
Or you don't want to calculate for stock A.

905
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,500
You want to calculate for stock B.

906
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:27,540
Or you want to do all of that at the same time.

907
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,780
Imagine how many times you have to change your code

908
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:33,420
if you go through that iteratively, right?

909
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:37,500
And then in the second example, it's a little bit more complex example.

910
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:43,140
So here you want to calculate the max average min of the length of streaks of zeros.

911
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,260
In a column of ones and zeros.

912
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,620
I know it's a mouthful.

913
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,260
But actually this is a very good interview questions

914
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,980
for all your recruiters out there.

915
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:57,140
Especially for PySpark because stack overflow and chat GPT

916
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:03,620
doesn't give a workable answer, but it's very complex even to understand.

917
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,620
But after seeing this talk, you'll be able to know

918
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,900
what are the three or four steps that you need to calculate this.

919
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:14,340
Anybody who doesn't know that, meaning they haven't seen this talk, don't hire them.

920
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:22,020
So yeah, it could be streaks of zeros or streaks of ones.

921
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:26,020
So right now here, the zero and one, I consider them to be logic.

922
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:31,500
As you will see in a bit, but just to illustrate how easy you can extend this.

923
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:35,020
So the goal I want is the separation of data and logic.

924
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:39,700
And also I want the logic to be modular and reusable so I can plug and play.

925
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,740
Then into different pipelines to build more complex logic.

926
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:47,740
And I want to distill the essence of desired subset of pendants.

927
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,540
I don't want to recreate all the pendants.

928
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,140
I'm not Brett.

929
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:57,260
So, but if there's need, then people can build it.

930
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:04,420
So here is an example of what you can do for the first scenario I showed.

931
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:08,860
So you calculate the 7 day sum average of stock A's price.

932
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:14,900
So you can see the top part is the logic and the bottom part is the data.

933
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:18,340
So they're pretty much separate.

934
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:18,980
Right?

935
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,620
And then you might think, OK, this doesn't look like pendants.

936
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,700
These are just JSON configs.

937
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:24,060
Right?

938
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,180
Yeah, I know it's a little bit prerogative.

939
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:31,020
But if you can write JSON configs and have the backend work out the pendant logic,

940
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:31,540
why not?

941
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:32,500
Right?

942
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:37,420
And then if I just want to change this to a 7 day, one month sum average of stock A

943
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:41,700
and B's price and volume, if you look closely, I'm going to do it again.

944
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,300
OK?

945
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,660
You just change the data part.

946
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:48,500
You just add two strings, three strings.

947
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,820
And then you don't need to change the logic part.

948
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:56,060
So this is what I mean by separation of logic and data.

949
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:01,740
So this basically distills everything that you need to do this computation.

950
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:06,620
So pendants is basically an implementation, maybe an implementation detail that you

951
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,340
don't need to know.

952
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:15,180
And then for the second example here, the more complex thing about calculating the

953
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,900
streaks.

954
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,300
So you can see these are the four steps.

955
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:23,140
So, yep.

956
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:27,060
And this last quote, best code is no code at all.

957
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,100
Thank you.

958
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:38,700
You really do have like a full ramp you have to sprint up on that side.

959
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,620
Yeah, I feel like I already did the sprint.

960
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:45,340
So I already one day ahead of everybody.

961
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:50,820
So we're just going to close up with a few reminders about some events and

962
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:56,460
activities and things to pay attention to as the lightning talks now are officially over.

963
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,820
So first things first.

964
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:58,980
Oh, but.

965
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,420
But all the lightning talk is officially over.

966
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:05,700
But if you kind of not get selected or now you just come up with a new

967
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,900
lightning talk, you can go to the open space.

968
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,540
There is an unofficial lightning talk there.

969
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,100
Correct.

970
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:14,540
Which is again, so lovingly titled lightning talks.

971
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,540
They didn't want you to hear at 12 p.m.

972
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,540
in room 250 AB.

973
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:24,380
And we will not take that title too personally.

974
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:29,340
So another thing about the sprint is that today at 5 p.m.

975
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,540
back here, we'll have a sprint orientation.

976
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,340
So for the first timer who don't know, oh, what is a sprint?

977
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:38,300
But you have a few days, you know, you're still around the city.

978
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:42,740
Then please come to the orientation and see what you can do in the sprints.

979
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,780
So for people who are not the first timer and then you already plan to stay for the

980
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:51,460
sprint, please also come and see what projects you can sprint on on Monday.

981
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,340
Fantastic.

982
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:56,900
And as one last reminder, if you did not buy your conference t-shirt at 11 p.m.

983
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,860
or 11 p.m.

984
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:58,420
11 a.m.

985
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,700
If you're here at 11 p.m.

986
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:00,940
That's confusing.

987
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:01,700
11 a.m.

988
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,540
There's t-shirt sales, suggestion donation of $20.

989
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:08,740
One other thing I did want to plug, if you were interested in the Python

990
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:13,180
Software Foundation specifically, we have an election coming up for directors.

991
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,140
I'm a previous chairperson and director.

992
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:19,500
I would be super happy to answer your questions as well as many other people

993
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,500
that are at the PSF booth, our staff, volunteers.

994
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,340
They can help answer any questions you may have if you're a little bit

995
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,620
interested in that.

996
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,460
But I think that's about all of our announcements.

997
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,660
So we're going to go ahead and conclude.

998
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:35,380
This is the end of lightning talks for 2023.

999
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,580
Thank you so much, PyCon.

1000
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,180
You all have been amazing.

1001
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,980
All right.

1002
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:52,340
The irony is that took longer than my talk is going to take.

1003
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,540
My name is Tom Calloway.

1004
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,300
Everybody calls me Spot.

1005
00:52:55,340 --> 00:53:01,420
I'm an open source evangelist strategist at AWS.

1006
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:05,420
I'm here today to talk a little bit about PyPy.

1007
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:12,460
If I can get this thing to work, go for it.

1008
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,460
Okay.

1009
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:19,500
So PyPy and AWS have been partners since 2018 when PyPy was fully rewritten in

1010
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,740
order to scale a little bit better.

1011
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:27,260
Part of that work was to overhaul the back end and rewrite PyPy to run on top

1012
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,820
of AWS.

1013
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:32,420
Today, PyPy has been able to scale and meet the growing needs of the Python

1014
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,700
ecosystem.

1015
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:38,260
Many, many kudos to E and the infrastructure team who support PyPy along with all of

1016
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,460
the volunteers and release managers for Python.

1017
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:51,820
Currently, PyPy is averaging 425 requests per second to the back ends on AWS for a

1018
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:54,540
total of 257 million requests per week.

1019
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:56,580
You all are hitting that thing a lot.

1020
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:02,340
At Amazon, one of our principles is that success and scale bring broad

1021
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:03,500
responsibility.

1022
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,580
And as part of our commitment to this principle, we're investing in open source

1023
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:09,900
projects that are critical to our customers, our builders, and the rest of

1024
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:10,780
the world.

1025
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:15,700
We're proud to provide AWS credits to cover all of the AWS costs for PyPy, which is

1026
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,460
something that we've done for five years now.

1027
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:27,700
Python is a critical component for AWS and its customers, and we recognize the

1028
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:31,340
responsibility that we have to give back to the open source communities that we

1029
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,380
rely on.

1030
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:37,940
Today, there's a new challenge for PyPy and open source.

1031
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:42,420
Supply chain security is an industry-wide issue, so I'm not trying to sort of say,

1032
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,220
well, this is the only place that's having this problem.

1033
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:49,220
But PyPy is facing threats like typo-squatting, malware, dependency

1034
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,500
confusion, support ticket backlogs.

1035
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:56,420
AWS in particular has been a very notable target of a lot of these things.

1036
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,940
And right now, we have one volunteer, Dustin Ingram, I don't know if they're

1037
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:05,420
here, but if they are, my hat is seriously off to you, for taking down 88% of the

1038
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,900
malware on PyPy alone.

1039
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:17,540
That's fantastic, but it really doesn't scale very well.

1040
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:22,260
And so we are proud today to announce that we are becoming the first official

1041
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,380
security sponsor of the Python Software Foundation.

1042
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:29,100
We're increasing our commitment to securing critical open source software and

1043
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:33,700
providing additional funding, which will allow the PSF to hire a full-time safety

1044
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,860
and security engineer to work on PyPy.

1045
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:46,260
I'm going to briefly deviate from my notes here to say that when they asked if I

1046
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,500
would give this talk, the one condition I had was that it had to have a really

1047
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:56,140
sweet cartoon snake to go with it, and this is what I got.

1048
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:59,980
Obviously, the Python Package Index is critical to countless companies and other

1049
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,580
users, and we feel strongly that this new position will help alleviate the

1050
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:08,060
bottleneck of support issues, remove malware faster, and keep PyPy secure for

1051
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,020
the benefit of all of its users.

1052
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:14,260
Basically, we want to help put armor on Python so that developers and users can

1053
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:18,660
continue to feel safe using PyPy.

1054
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:23,860
So we set out some goals together with the PSF for this new role, things like

1055
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:28,500
creating a standardized way to report malware to PyPy via API, not via human

1056
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:33,180
ticket, streamlining the malware review process, lowering the average PyPy

1057
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:36,740
response time for malware takedown from the seven days where it's at currently

1058
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,100
to three days after report, developing a security plan with improvement

1059
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:46,380
milestones, enabling proper security audit of all new PyPy features before

1060
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:50,260
they launch, decreasing the average time for all of the security support

1061
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:54,500
requests, and most importantly, freeing up the PyPy maintainers to focus on

1062
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,620
adding new features without feeling like they're having to sacrifice the

1063
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:01,700
security concerns.

1064
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:06,020
Thank you all so much for everything that you do for the Python community.

1065
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,060
We're proud to be able to support you.

1066
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:22,340
I need those pictures.

1067
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,540
I want to make stickers today.

1068
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,020
All right.

1069
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,820
Thank you, Spot.

1070
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:34,100
So that job is live right now at jobs.python.org, and you can come work with

1071
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:38,500
me and the others at the PSF.

1072
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:39,940
I am E.

1073
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:43,780
I'm the director of infrastructure at the Python Software Foundation, and I'm

1074
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:44,820
very...

1075
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:45,820
Oh.

1076
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:53,740
I'm very glad you're here, whether you're in this room or online.

1077
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:57,020
And let's just from my heart.

1078
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:03,940
Five years ago today, approximately, at PyCon, we were celebrating PyPy

1079
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:09,700
relaunching as warehouse on AWS as a full new rewrite.

1080
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:14,060
And one of the things that we were most excited about in this was not just the

1081
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:18,620
maintainability of the code, but the ability to deliver new things more

1082
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,540
easily and more safely.

1083
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,340
We've done a lot of that.

1084
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:27,700
Focus has primarily been around security, and it will continue to be with the

1085
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,700
ever-growing threats.

1086
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:33,620
But in addition to that, we've also delivered features that are just usability

1087
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,980
or purposeful.

1088
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:41,580
So today, we're rolling out a step that goes beyond just a feature and works

1089
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:46,940
towards the sustainability and financial support of PyPI, while also giving our

1090
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:51,460
users one of the most requested features, organizations.

1091
00:58:52,340 --> 00:59:01,300
So I'm not going to sort of make this sound like it's more than it is.

1092
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:05,620
The truthful feature, the truth of it all is that organizations are just ways to

1093
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:10,740
organize your projects, organize your teams, and organize your permissions.

1094
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:16,060
It's a first step in what we hope will be a long road of features that basically

1095
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:23,380
provide a lot of good value out of PyPI for not just us as a community, but for

1096
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,260
corporate users as well.

1097
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:30,940
So we're making organizations available for community projects for free forever.

1098
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,460
And I just want that to be clear.

1099
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:38,020
We're never going to get me in the business of doing things just to extract money

1100
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:42,020
from the people who need it to do their work in the open.

1101
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:47,140
And for corporate projects, these features will be available at a small fee.

1102
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:54,860
In the last year, PyPI served 235 billion downloads for the 550,000 projects that

1103
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,420
are hosted there.

1104
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:01,100
This means that since the previous period, we saw 57% annual growth.

1105
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,740
And I was a little shocked because I was just sort of updating some canned notes

1106
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:08,740
and noticed that it was 57% of four.

1107
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:14,420
If you've learned anything about the way that curves grow recently, you'll know

1108
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:20,620
that if you have the same growth rate period over period, it's exponential growth.

1109
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:25,060
So having more people using and contributing to Python every year is a fantastic

1110
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:26,460
problem to have.

1111
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,860
But it's one that we have to increase organizational capacity through

1112
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:34,420
sponsorships like AWS and our...

1113
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:34,980
I'm blanking.

1114
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:35,500
I should add that.

1115
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:42,420
I know it's other sponsors as well who help pay to put employees onto projects.

1116
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:46,820
And so by charging for these organization features for corporate uses, it increases

1117
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:50,700
the ability for PyPI to become a staff platform that can respond to all manner of

1118
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:57,740
support requests, not just security, in a timely fashion for everyone.

1119
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:01,900
So again, we want to be very clear that these new features are completely optional

1120
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:04,540
and completely free if you're a community project.

1121
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:11,900
If features that are required for larger teams and larger projects don't sound

1122
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,900
appetizing to you, don't worry.

1123
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:17,260
You don't have to use these things.

1124
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:22,220
But it may be something that could be useful for larger teams and larger projects.

1125
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,060
There's no obligation to create an organization and absolutely nothing about

1126
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:26,060
PyPI.

1127
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:31,100
Nothing about using PyPI will change if you don't opt in.

1128
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:37,820
And this is only the basis for future work.

1129
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:41,500
We look forward to discussing what other features PyPI users would like to see

1130
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:42,820
tackled next.

1131
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:45,260
We know there are a lot of ideas out there around safety, security, and

1132
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,340
usability.

1133
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:49,220
And we're looking forward to having a way to connect directly with people who we

1134
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:54,380
know are using the features, which currently is difficult.

1135
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:58,260
Versus coming through an organization we know who to talk to.

1136
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:01,460
And in the spirit of open source, we always want to welcome that feedback at

1137
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,860
github.pypi.warehouse.

1138
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,740
So these are available today.

1139
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:10,820
Maybe even right now?

1140
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:11,260
I don't know.

1141
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,060
Probably.

1142
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,780
So we're flipping a feature flag.

1143
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,260
It's going to be instantaneous.

1144
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,300
And you...

1145
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,780
What's that?

1146
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:20,180
Cool.

1147
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,380
So they're there now.

1148
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:26,380
So...

1149
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:30,620
Both community projects as well as corporate teams can sign up today to request

1150
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:31,460
their name.

1151
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,580
We're going to be validating and verifying these.

1152
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:36,940
So it may take some time before your organization is brought online.

1153
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:41,180
For community projects, that may start happening over the next week or two.

1154
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:46,740
For corporate teams, we'll be finalizing the legal and accounting things necessary.

1155
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:51,020
And you can expect to see some of those details in May.

1156
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:56,180
The most important part for me anyway about this is the shout outs and thank yous.

1157
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:59,740
Organization feature development was approved by the packaging working group and

1158
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:03,180
funded through the Python Software Foundation sponsorship program.

1159
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:06,940
Thanks to our sponsors for making this work possible.

1160
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:10,300
We especially want to thank Bloomberg for funding our packaging project manager,

1161
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:14,380
Shamika Mohana, who oversaw this work.

1162
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:17,980
And as always, a shout out to the companies that donate services in kind to

1163
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,340
run PyPI.

1164
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:24,420
We're also grateful for the many PyPI users who shared their perspectives with

1165
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:28,900
Shamika during user studies and laid the foundation for these new features.

1166
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:32,580
And lastly, I want to thank our beta testers, including the brand new

1167
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:37,500
organizations on PyPI, the Python Cryptographic Authority, the Palettes

1168
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:41,060
Project, and Certify.

1169
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,100
That's all I got.

1170
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,100
Thank you.

1171
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,980
All right.

1172
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,020
Well, yes, thank you so much, Eve, for those updates.

1173
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:02,060
It's amazing news.

1174
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:07,340
And right now we have the job fair and the posters are happening.

1175
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:10,380
There will be talks after lunch break.

1176
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,420
So go ahead.

1177
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,420
Thank you.
