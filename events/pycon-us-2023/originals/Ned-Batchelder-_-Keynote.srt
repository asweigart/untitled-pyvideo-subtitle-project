1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
Thank you, Marietta.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,480
We appreciate you.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,600
And when you come back, make sure to give me a high five so I can get one point.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,760
Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,000
And welcome to PyCon US.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
My name is Itamar.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm a software engineer on Meta's internal Python platform team.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,360
And I'm thrilled to be here today to help kick off PyCon US and hopefully not waste

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,480
too much of your time before our first keynote speaker.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,480
So first I wanted to begin by expressing how proud we are to be a visionary sponsor of the

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,360
Python Software Foundation.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,360
We are also excited to announce that we have extended our support for the amazing and influential

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:01:02,440
developer in residence position for one more year.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:11,440
And specifically, we are very glad that it is Woukash that we love very much and we are

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:18,440
enabling him to stick around for a while more.

16
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,480
We are honored to contribute to the growth and development of the Python community and

17
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,080
are thrilled to be part of such a vibrant community.

18
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,560
Python and the Python ecosystem is incredibly important to us at Meta.

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,560
With CPython itself and some other implementations and thousands and thousands of open source

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,600
libraries and packages, we rely on all of those to power services like Instagram, a

21
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,960
wide range of AI and ML systems and thousands of tools, scripts, automations that tie everything

22
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,600
together.

23
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,240
And we appreciate everyone who contributes to it, all the open source maintainers, core

24
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,520
developers, CPython contributors and everyone that helps enabling that.

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,560
Thank you everyone.

26
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,960
We believe in the power of open source to drive innovation and we have open sourced

27
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,040
numerous libraries and frameworks ourselves, which you are all welcome to check up on GitHub.

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,600
Even contribute, we welcome contributions.

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,720
So yeah, thank you all for joining us today and we can't wait to hear from the keynote

30
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,560
speaker.

31
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
Thank you.

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
Mariana.

33
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,560
All right.

34
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,560
So thank you again, Meta, Itamar, for sharing your message.

35
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:06,560
So, when I was tasked with choosing keynote speaker, I thought about who do I want to

36
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,800
invite, who do I want you all to hear from?

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:21,800
And I know that I talk about the first timers and I reminisce about my own self, what it

38
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,440
was like when I was new.

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,600
And I think about who are the people who have been helping me, who are the people who I

40
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:39,160
look up to, who are the people who have been supporting me throughout my journey in Python.

41
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:51,600
So I really want to just introduce you to people who are really influential to me.

42
00:03:51,600 --> 00:04:00,360
And that probably didn't know this, but on the day before my first ever made talk at

43
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,120
a local meetup, I was freaking out.

44
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,240
I was so scared.

45
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,080
I was ready to pull the plug.

46
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,960
I was going to call in sick and cancel.

47
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,640
And then I asked for help.

48
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,640
I think all I needed was someone to encourage me.

49
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,160
And Net was there.

50
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,880
I think all he did, all he said was just, this is a good talk.

51
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,160
That's all.

52
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:41,720
And I think if Net wasn't there, none of the ice cream selfies probably will not happen.

53
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,200
So thank you, Net.

54
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,040
And really I just want you all to know about Net Bachelor.

55
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,760
So Net, welcome on stage.

56
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,600
I think now I have to start with, you're not crying, I'm crying.

57
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,200
I did not know that, Marietta.

58
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,520
Thank you very much.

59
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,440
And also, by the way, I feel like I am cool because I am on the stage where the lightning

60
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,840
talks will be rather than the other way around.

61
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,600
So thank you, Marietta and the PSF and everyone else for inviting me here.

62
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,880
It's an honor to be here on stage at the 20th anniversary of PyCon.

63
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,720
I saw a lot of people in those pictures that I know.

64
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,000
I saw myself in a few of those pictures.

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,960
And I'm reminded again of the energy here at PyCon.

66
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,520
So before I start, I have a question.

67
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,160
Are you excited for PyCon?

68
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,680
Are you excited for PyCon?

69
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,720
All right.

70
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,440
All right, good.

71
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,560
There were some pictures up there before.

72
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,040
When I mentioned that I was doing this talk to my friend Antonio, I told him that I wasn't

73
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,480
at the first PyCon in 2003.

74
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,840
He said that he was.

75
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,400
And he sent me a picture.

76
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,600
Here's Antonio on the right with another conference attendee.

77
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,760
And I think the cool thing about PyCon is that some things haven't changed over 20 years.

78
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,760
My first PyCon actually was in 2007 in Dallas.

79
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:35,480
And Gito did the keynote there where he talked about the plans for this thing coming up called Python 3.0.

80
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:41,640
During his keynote, he momentarily forgot the word annotations and said, you know, the things that aren't

81
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,800
type declarations.

82
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,440
So some things have changed over 20 years, I guess.

83
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,240
But when I thought about doing this talk, I thought, well, what should I talk about?

84
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,240
I thought about the various ways I've been part of the Python community, things that

85
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,880
I've done.

86
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,600
I thought about, you know, what should my keynote be about?

87
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,120
So my day job, I work at edX, which is a 2U company working on the Open edX project, which

88
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,680
is a large Python and Django application that powers edX.org and thousands of other online

89
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,620
sites around the world.

90
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,420
So I thought I could talk about online education or million line monoliths or building large

91
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:26,000
open source projects within a for-profit company.

92
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,720
I've been maintaining coverage.py for a long time.

93
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,000
This is Sleepy Snake.

94
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,040
Thank you.

95
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,000
This is Sleepy Snake, the mascot of coverage.py.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,760
He's covered and he's resting easy because he knows his tests work.

97
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,480
And notice that he's in the shape of a C for coverage.

98
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,360
So I could talk about what is it like to maintain a project that's widely used by many people

99
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
in the community.

100
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,320
I also maintain smaller projects that may not go anywhere but sometimes do, so I could

101
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,760
have talked about that.

102
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,360
I am an organizer for Boston Python, which is a local meetup.

103
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,900
So I thought maybe we could talk about, you know, how that sort of dynamic works.

104
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,920
What did we do during the pandemic to keep things going?

105
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,600
Boston Python is actually doing really well.

106
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,560
We have three new organizers since the pandemic started, one of whom I only met in person

107
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,640
yesterday at the reception.

108
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,080
We have three new kinds of events that we've been running during the pandemic virtually.

109
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,640
So it's actually going really well.

110
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,840
I've been running a blog for a long time, actually since before PyCon, the first PyCon.

111
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,040
So I thought I could talk about what is it like to put ill-formed opinions out on the

112
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,960
internet for abuse.

113
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,560
I hang out in online arenas like IRC or Slack or Discord.

114
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,800
So I could talk about what is it like to help beginners or how are these environments the

115
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,440
same and different.

116
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,800
For instance, in Discord, I'm hanging out with people a quarter of my age who often

117
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,720
ask me is that really you in the profile picture because they think that if a gray hair guy

118
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,440
is in a picture, it's probably a meme rather than really a person.

119
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,640
But then I thought, well, let's step back.

120
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,040
What do all of these things have in common?

121
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,680
I wanted to talk about something bigger, right?

122
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,680
It's a keynote.

123
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,160
It should be big, right?

124
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,960
So I decided that I would talk about high uncertainty components in complex systems.

125
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,200
All right.

126
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,080
That's not really the title of the keynote.

127
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:33,080
I do want to talk about things that are less certain to us and how we interact with them.

128
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,080
But there's a much simpler way to describe what those things are than this fancy high-tech

129
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,560
jargon that I put here just to entice you all to keep listening to me.

130
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,880
The simpler way to describe what I'm going to talk about is people.

131
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:54,080
And what I mean by that is that we as engineers interact with people, of course, but as engineers,

132
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,860
we might approach those people as if they were technical components.

133
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,720
We may think less of the work we have to put into interacting with those people, and as

134
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,840
a result, the interactions might not go as well as they might.

135
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,600
But as engineers, we can use the skills we have to learn how to do complex things with

136
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,760
computers and software and electronics and apply those skills to our interactions with

137
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,040
people and make those interactions go better.

138
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,740
And often we think of those things as soft skills.

139
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,800
We call them soft skills.

140
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,480
And some people don't like the term soft skills because it sounds like we're lowering it,

141
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
right?

142
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,040
We've got the hard skills.

143
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
Those are important.

144
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,400
We've got the soft skills.

145
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,480
There's the hard skills and soft skills.

146
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,280
I don't think of it that way.

147
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,520
I think that the reason people think soft skills are less is because as quantitative,

148
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:55,160
technical, engineering-type people, we value the hard edges of the hard skills.

149
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,600
There's numbers attached to it, and you can design processes, and you can automate them,

150
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
and you can do all that sort of stuff.

151
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
And we like that.

152
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,640
And then dealing with people, the soft skills, it's all squishy and subjective, and there's

153
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:13,560
no linters that you can apply to your Slack conversations or whatever to figure it out.

154
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,840
There's no coverage.py that can tell you whether you're getting along with that person or something.

155
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Right?

156
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:26,640
So it's all squishy and soft, and that's exactly what makes it difficult.

157
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,160
If you like, you can think of soft skills as emotional intelligence.

158
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,960
At least it's got that cool word intelligence in it, right?

159
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,360
So that's maybe that will appeal to us a little bit more.

160
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:45,160
But honestly, if you think about it, people are terrible, pretty much.

161
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,720
But only if you think of them as components.

162
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,000
If you approach people as an engineer and think, I don't have to worry about this, then

163
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,480
yes, people will be terrible.

164
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,280
But they don't have to be terrible, because if you take their interaction seriously and

165
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,720
then they won't be terrible.

166
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,840
Let's look at some of the engineering qualities that we value and how people stack up on those

167
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,120
criteria.

168
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,360
So this clicker's a little weird.

169
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,000
First thing, people are nonstandard.

170
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,040
They're all different, right?

171
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,480
We got this guy on the right.

172
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,440
He's trying to figure out the people on the left.

173
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
They're all different.

174
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
They're all weird.

175
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,040
You know, what he says to that first guy, he's probably not going to work if he says

176
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,640
it to the second guy.

177
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,160
They're all different in different ways, big ways, little ways.

178
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,320
There's no way to know.

179
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,880
And because they're all different, you meet a new person.

180
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,400
There's no documentation, right?

181
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,440
This poor guy, he's just met this pointy-headed person and he's scrambling through all these

182
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,320
books and there's no explanation.

183
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,240
And because there's no explanation, people can be really unpredictable.

184
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,720
Oh, this is going to go great.

185
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,080
I know exactly what's going to happen.

186
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,360
He's going to talk about a stellated dodecahedron.

187
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,560
Nope, didn't do that.

188
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,200
He didn't do what you thought he was going to do.

189
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Sorry.

190
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,480
And because they're unpredictable, I mean, they're unpredictable partly because they've

191
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,320
got all this hidden state, right?

192
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,280
When we write our Python programs, one of the big no-nos is mutable global variables,

193
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
right?

194
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,360
People's heads are full of mutable globals, right?

195
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,460
When you come and talk to me, I may still be thinking about that rotten breakfast I

196
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,560
had at the hotel this morning.

197
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:36,040
You'll say something to me and you don't know that I'm thinking about that or my shoes are

198
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,880
too tight or I'm worried about my kid back home or something, right?

199
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,280
And all of that is hidden from you, right?

200
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,520
Oh, and by the way, this guy, one of the things he's thinking about is Sleepy Snake.

201
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:54,080
So he's got Coverage.py in his mind so I can relate to that guy.

202
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,440
And because of all that hidden state, you've got these nonlinear responses, right?

203
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:06,720
You say a little thing to a guy and suddenly it blows up in your face, right?

204
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,880
For engineering components, we'd like to have a little bit more input, give us a little

205
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,520
bit more output, and that is not the way people work.

206
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:22,800
And when things go badly, you might try to find out what's happening and they say, nothing.

207
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,240
You know, nothing.

208
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,400
That's a terrible error message, right?

209
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:34,240
In our systems, we like to provide feedback to the user about what went wrong and people

210
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,280
are not always good at that.

211
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,640
And it might be because they don't want to tell you that they're worried about their

212
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,840
kid or they think they're in a space where they're not allowed to be that vulnerable

213
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,160
or they really don't want to get into it.

214
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,040
There's just all sorts of reasons why that happens.

215
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,080
As engineers, we have to understand these kinds of dynamics and take them into accounts

216
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,560
as we deal with people so that things can go well.

217
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:05,040
So, you might be thinking to yourself now, okay, so these components, you know, I could

218
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,000
use a Raspberry Pi or I could talk to this person.

219
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,240
Why would I choose the person?

220
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
They're terrible.

221
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,080
Well, you don't really have a choice, right?

222
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,440
No matter how introverted you are, no matter how much time you spend in the quiet room,

223
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,000
you are going to be dealing with people, right?

224
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,160
You've got a boss, you've got coworkers, you've got collaborators.

225
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,520
Whatever you're building, someone's going to end up using it.

226
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,360
You're going to have to deal with people, right?

227
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,800
This is a part of your life and a part of your job and it's too easy sometimes for engineers

228
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,480
to simply overlook that aspect of what they do and therefore have it come out badly when

229
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,840
if you focus on it as a skill that you can build, it can go better.

230
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,680
And let's face it, people are fantastic, right?

231
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,600
I mean, they are flexible.

232
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,520
They can do things that other people can't, right?

233
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,360
If Marietta had said to a bunch of Raspberry Pis, can you help me organize this conference,

234
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,200
it would not be a good conference.

235
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,120
Instead, she can say to people, can you help me organize this conference and they are flexible

236
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,120
and will adapt and do great things, right?

237
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,480
Some of that unpredictability comes out as creativity.

238
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,160
I asked you to do a thing, I had an idea about how it would go and you did something beyond

239
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,360
my expectations.

240
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,620
That's amazing, that's great.

241
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,800
And they can reflect that energy back to us, right?

242
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,340
If I put some energy into you, you give some energy back to me.

243
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,760
And lastly, like I said, they are kind of the reason we are doing any of this, right?

244
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,000
Whatever it is you are doing, it's probably because there is a person somewhere that you

245
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,720
are doing it for.

246
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,840
At least I hope.

247
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:48,360
So I want to talk about how to talk to people, but again, you are a technical audience.

248
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,880
I don't, rather than try to convince you that you want to talk to people, let's just look

249
00:16:51,880 --> 00:17:04,520
at it as people, the API user's guide.

250
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,880
The first, so let me just explain something before I get into that.

251
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,960
Let me just say, I am not a psychologist.

252
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,720
I am an engineer.

253
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:22,000
This model of the people, the user's guide, API user's guide, this is based on my own

254
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,240
experiences, debugging a bunch of interactions, reverse engineering a lot of people, reading

255
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,880
the trace backs from a lot of discussions that didn't go that great, and thinking about

256
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,400
how they could have gone better.

257
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,040
I am seeing some nods in the audience.

258
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,920
People know what I am talking about.

259
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,280
It's a little tricky.

260
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,680
Okay.

261
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,520
The way I think about interaction with a person is, when I talk to you, and by talking I could

262
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,600
mean talking, I could mean typing, I could mean sending an email, I could mean commenting

263
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,960
on a pull request, any way that I am sending words to you.

264
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,400
Every message consists of two parts.

265
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,080
There is information, which is the thing I mean to say, this, you know, you shouldn't

266
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,480
use Len of range over there, or I need you to do this task, or whatever it is I am saying

267
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,520
to you, there is facts involved, but there is also always sentiment.

268
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,360
Every message has both information and sentiment.

269
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,240
That's just the way people work.

270
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,320
When I talk to you, you are thinking about how I feel about you.

271
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,920
You know those programs that like read every tweet and do sentiment analysis to figure

272
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,960
out whether people like Nike sneakers or whatever brand, you know, people do sentiment analysis

273
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,160
all the time.

274
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,200
Every time I speak to you, you are trying to figure out how I feel about you.

275
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,600
You may not realize you are doing it, but you are analyzing every message that way.

276
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,120
That's because you want to feel good about yourself and you are a social emotional creature

277
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,760
that gets that feedback from around you and integrates it into your own self worth, essentially.

278
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,240
I know that sounds a little extreme in some ways.

279
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,120
It might just be a tiny amount, but it is happening all the time.

280
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,480
When I say sentiment, it comes down to sort of what those sentiment analysis programs

281
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,480
do, which is it is either a yes or a no.

282
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,320
I think of every message as being either a yes or a no.

283
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,840
The words in the message can either welcome you in or they can push you away.

284
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,560
Sometimes in just tiny ways, sometimes in really big ways.

285
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,440
But I think essentially every message can be categorized on one side or the other of

286
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,880
that boundary.

287
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,880
And the goal is to try to make every message be a yes.

288
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,520
The problem with information and sentiment is that people will find a sentiment even

289
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,680
if you didn't put it in there.

290
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,920
And they will default it in a few different ways.

291
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,560
The first way is they will think about their history with you.

292
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
Right?

293
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,800
Marietta just explained her history with me.

294
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,600
I can say things to Marietta and for the most part, it will be on a yes, if only because

295
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,360
Marietta has had a lot of positive experiences with me in the past.

296
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,360
Right?

297
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,880
If I walk up to someone with whom I've had a lot of conflict, a lot of those messages

298
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,480
will be considered negative because of our history.

299
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,560
The second place, the default sentiment will come from is similarity.

300
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,080
I've never met you before, but you seem kind of like me.

301
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,360
So probably it's positive.

302
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,800
And what do I mean by similarity?

303
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,640
It could be anything.

304
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,740
It could be you have the same stickers on your laptop as I do.

305
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,860
It could be that you're at PyCon with me.

306
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,680
In this building, if I say something to someone, it will probably strike that person better

307
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,640
Then if we happen to bump into each other with no identification out on the street because

308
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,760
they're like, oh, you're at PyCon, I'm at PyCon.

309
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,720
When my kid was little on the beach, he would just walk up to another kid who was like the

310
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
same age as him.

311
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,400
He's like, you're a kid, I'm a kid, let's just play together.

312
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,000
That similarity just works for people.

313
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,160
And if there's no history and you don't feel a similarity, then you can just, I don't like

314
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
these clickers.

315
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,800
I don't like these clickers.

316
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,600
If you can't find the similarity, then you can pretty much assume that the sentiment

317
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
is bad.

318
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
It's going to be on the no side.

319
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Right?

320
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,480
And by the way, as I'm explaining this to you, let me just be clear.

321
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,000
I am not only am I not a psychologist, I'm not perfect at this.

322
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,040
I know for sure that I have had conflicts with people in this room.

323
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,280
I mean, first of all, my wife is sitting in the front row.

324
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,160
But second of all, I mean, I know I've had conflicts with people in this room that were

325
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:00,200
based on nothing more than I was careless and I said something too fast in a way that

326
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,400
wasn't thoughtful enough and it struck that person wrong and we had to unravel that.

327
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,960
And I know it's going to happen again in the future because I'm human and we're busy and

328
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
that's okay.

329
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,440
Standing in a programming conference, the goal isn't to never write a bug.

330
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,840
The goal is to be good at recognizing the bugs and fixing the bugs when they happen.

331
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,840
And that's the same thing that we can expect from interactions with each other.

332
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,800
So the defaulted sentiment, history, similarity, and bad.

333
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:34,640
And fourth, there's going to be some, I have to kind of get this moved down.

334
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,600
The defaulted sentiment is going to be that hidden state, right?

335
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,440
Everything's going to be colored by the bad breakfast you had or your too tight shoes

336
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,120
or you're worried about your kid, whatever it was.

337
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,280
Right, so all that sentiment gets defaulted if it isn't present.

338
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:54,680
And just because it's, and by the way, so the yes and the no's, the reason you want

339
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:01,000
to avoid the no's is that people will defend themselves and probably won't listen to you

340
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,440
if they're hearing no's from you.

341
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
Right?

342
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,920
So you're going to have someone yell at them and expect them to stay in contact with you.

343
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,040
And just to make this very concrete, let's look at some code.

344
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,520
Now, just to be clear, this is pseudo code.

345
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,400
It's not the real code.

346
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,720
But very simply, yeah, so when someone receives a message, they knew who the sender is, they've

347
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,120
got the info, but the sentiment might be missing.

348
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,160
If it's missing, they're going to try to find history with the sender.

349
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,280
If they still don't have any sentiment, they're going to try to calculate a similarity.

350
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,480
And if it's missing still, then the sentiment is bad.

351
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,520
And then they apply all that hidden state, get all those mutable globals in the mix just

352
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,400
to complicate things.

353
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,920
They'll record that history, by the way.

354
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,680
So whatever they defaulted, that's now part of your history with that person.

355
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,240
That's not your fault, but that happens.

356
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,040
And if the sentiment is negative, then they're just going to throw away the information.

357
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,120
And otherwise, they're going to use the information.

358
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,720
That's it.

359
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,360
People like to think they're complicated.

360
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,000
It's pretty simple in some ways.

361
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,440
At some level, it's kind of simple.

362
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,760
And you might also be thinking, like, okay, come on, we're all grownups, we're all adults

363
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,000
here as we say in the Python community.

364
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,440
Can't we just stick to the facts?

365
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,560
And the answer is no.

366
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,800
I know this is 2023, so AI, yeah, yeah, yeah, but we're still talking to people.

367
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,320
For the time being, at least, we are still talking to people.

368
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,720
We're not going to be talking to robots.

369
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,120
And this is the way people work.

370
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:38,480
And by the way, I don't mean to shock anyone, but everyone here, you are also one of these

371
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,840
people that is doing this sentiment analysis.

372
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,840
So at the same time that this poor guy on the right was trying to figure out all those

373
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,360
four people on the left, they were all trying to figure out him.

374
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,000
So it's a two-way street, right?

375
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,480
And you don't realize that you're doing sentiment analysis to other people.

376
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,160
I know you all love me right now because I'm amazing, but in the future, you might be having

377
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,600
a negative interaction with me, and that's just bound to happen.

378
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,640
So you're doing the sentiment analysis at the same time that people are doing it to

379
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
you.

380
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,600
It's a two-way interaction.

381
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,080
So what can we do here?

382
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,040
To improve your chances of not having defaulted sentiment that ruins an interaction, first

383
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,280
thing is to say yes.

384
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,520
I'll get into these more.

385
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,920
Second, use more words.

386
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,120
Third, choose your words carefully.

387
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,080
Four, be humble.

388
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,360
And five, be explicit.

389
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,560
Let's talk about the Meech intern.

390
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,880
And what I'm going to show here, I'm going to show interactions.

391
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,400
I'm showing it in sort of a chat format because that works visually.

392
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,680
And mostly what we've got is kind of newbies on the left asking questions from helpers

393
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,280
on the right because I've got a lot of experience from IRC and Slack and Discord, which are

394
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:01,760
kind of intense crucibles of these kinds of interactions, but the principles apply

395
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,880
the same across.

396
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,000
It's just easier to have these little quick little interactions as demonstrations.

397
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,880
So first thing, I said say yes, but let's look at it as don't say no.

398
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,660
So the newbie asks, how do I get the length of this array?

399
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,240
And the helper says, that's not an array.

400
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,880
Now that's clearly a no statement, right?

401
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,080
It's got not in it, right?

402
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,520
And let's be honest.

403
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,280
The guy on the right is correct.

404
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,360
Like he's absolutely correct.

405
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,680
In terms of information, absolutely correct.

406
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,420
Totally unhelpful, right?

407
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,500
He's just immediately turned off this guy on the left who now has concluded that he

408
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,680
must be stupid, right?

409
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
That's a bad interaction.

410
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,760
Instead, when they say how do I get the length of this array, he could have said the length

411
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,000
of that list is and given the answer, right?

412
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,120
He's sneakily snuck in the information the newbie needed, which is that he used the wrong

413
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,600
word and gave him a yes.

414
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,400
He gave him the answer he needed and the newbie has learned something and is happy and has

415
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,200
had a positive interaction, right?

416
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,340
So say yes.

417
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,360
Make your statements be yeses.

418
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,440
Sometimes we don't use enough words, right?

419
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,960
I need help with thing.

420
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,560
Why are you using thing?

421
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,060
Now this is a mistake I make all the time.

422
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,680
I am genuinely interested to know why are you using it?

423
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
What's going on?

424
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,760
What's the big story?

425
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,520
But simply asking why are you using thing can make a person think I knew I was doing

426
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,520
it wrong.

427
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,360
It can sound like you shouldn't have been using thing.

428
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,560
If you use more words, thing can be tricky.

429
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,600
Good, it's not just me.

430
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,040
I had trouble with it when I started using it.

431
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,040
We're similar.

432
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,120
I'm not weird.

433
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,140
If you tell us more about how you're using thing, we can make it work.

434
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,580
They will help me, right?

435
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,080
So those are a lot of words, right?

436
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,140
In some ways the information content between the short version and the long version was

437
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,080
the same but the sentiment was completely different.

438
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,160
And using more words helps with that.

439
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,720
And by using more words, I don't mean add more technical detail.

440
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,120
I mean put in words that are explicitly there just to add the sentiment that you mean to

441
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,520
express.

442
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,320
And choose your words carefully.

443
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,040
My program says one plus two is four.

444
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
That's wrong.

445
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,320
Yeah, that's wrong.

446
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,720
That's why he's asking because he knows it's wrong, right?

447
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,880
But instead if you had said, hmm, that doesn't sound right, you've opened up a possibility,

448
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,880
right?

449
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,120
That's wrong is kind of closing a door.

450
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,520
It feels like something is shut.

451
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,640
Hmm, that doesn't sound right.

452
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,400
And I've put hmm in there on purpose.

453
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,440
That adds a little bit of uncertainty.

454
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,760
It puts the person on the right in an uncertain situation too.

455
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,080
It makes them more similar.

456
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:50,080
It levels the power balance between the two so that they can have a conversation.

457
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,120
And it's part of being humble.

458
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,280
This guy says my if loop only returns once.

459
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,280
Now let's just be clear.

460
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,620
I have no idea what that means.

461
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,120
That's complete nonsense.

462
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,040
Like I can see through the lines sometimes of questions that don't make sense.

463
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,760
When he asked about an array, I knew he meant list.

464
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,480
I have no idea what that means.

465
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,200
But if you say you aren't being clear, that's an accusation, right?

466
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,000
There's actually a negative in it.

467
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,200
And that's an accusation, right?

468
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,200
The helper has accused the asker of something.

469
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,480
If the helper instead says I don't understand yet, now they're taking some of the responsibility

470
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
for the interaction.

471
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,040
Instead of you haven't been clear, I don't understand yet, right?

472
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,880
That's a type of humility, right?

473
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,860
It's opening the possibility that there really is something going on that can be understood,

474
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,140
but it just doesn't understand it yet, right?

475
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,720
Being humble is something that experts often have difficulty with because we've worked

476
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,800
hard to know a lot of stuff and we're really proud of all the stuff we know and we're very

477
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,060
certain of a lot of things that we know.

478
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:59,060
And sometimes we're even in a situation where we are certain about a thing and we are actually

479
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:03,920
right about the thing, but that certainty will prevent further discussion.

480
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,320
I don't want to get into gender stereotypes, but one good way to be humble is whatever

481
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,320
the opposite of mansplaining is, do that.

482
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:25,960
And lastly, a simple way to not default sentiment is to be really explicit.

483
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,360
Someone says what do you think of my project?

484
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,880
Even doing this, it's not working.

485
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
Okay.

486
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,160
It's really good work, right?

487
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,760
That's a positive statement.

488
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
It's a yes.

489
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
It gives them encouragement.

490
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,320
It's really good work.

491
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,120
Now there are some things to fix, but I can help you.

492
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,440
So what we've done there was we've given them a yes and a little bit of a no and then a

493
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,440
yes.

494
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,440
And that's kind of a sandwich.

495
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,920
You give a positive and negative and a positive and that makes for a good interaction.

496
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,720
And a lot of this might sound like, well, this is just kindergarten stuff, right?

497
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,000
This is stuff we learned in kindergarten.

498
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,400
Ned, all you're saying is be nice and think of the other person.

499
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,720
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

500
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Be nice and think of the other person.

501
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
Right?

502
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm standing up here now telling you this, right?

503
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But this guy, that's me at about one-tenth my current age.

504
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,520
That guy could have probably told you this too because he learned it in kindergarten.

505
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,800
It's just that as we get older, we tend to focus more on the technical stuff and we think

506
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,720
everyone's going to take care of themselves, but they need help.

507
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
Everyone needs help.

508
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,880
We're all just people trying to understand this chaotic world around us.

509
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,200
We're surrounded by 2,000 people.

510
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Do they like us?

511
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
I don't know.

512
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Let's try to figure it out.

513
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,720
The more you can give the messages, the better it's going to go.

514
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
All right.

515
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,120
We've talked a lot about sentiment.

516
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,400
Let's talk about some information.

517
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,640
Let's get some technical content.

518
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,960
We'll talk about some technology.

519
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,840
In the mid-1400s, Gutenberg developed a process for producing printed pages for movable type.

520
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,840
I know that's not the technology you thought I was going to talk about.

521
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,840
This will go quick.

522
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,840
Don't worry.

523
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,840
It's an interest of mine.

524
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
There's a point at the end.

525
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
You'll see.

526
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,840
Stick with me.

527
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,400
Developed a process producing pages from movable type.

528
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,280
If you wanted to make a page like this, you arranged little chunks of metal in a press

529
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,280
like this.

530
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
You put ink on top.

531
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,280
You put paper on top.

532
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,280
You pressed it.

533
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,000
That's why we still call the journalists the press, by the way.

534
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,040
A piece of type was a little chunk of metal that looked like this.

535
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,620
It had to have the image of the letter on the top.

536
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:25,680
One of the challenges was making these chunks of type uniform enough that you could get

537
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,840
an even impression with a consistent design.

538
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,560
One of Gutenberg's innovations was he developed a process for doing that.

539
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:39,960
It would start with a chunk, a bar of steel called a punch into which the end would be

540
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,640
carved a reversed letter at actual size.

541
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:49,160
The punch would be driven into a little chunk of brass which would produce an indentation

542
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
called a matrix.

543
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,280
The matrix would be put at the bottom of a mold into which you could pour molten metal

544
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,480
over and over again which would produce all the pieces of type.

545
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,680
This process of making a punch was called punch cutting.

546
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:06,200
It was a very involved process because you had to work at actual size on a chunk of steel.

547
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,280
It was very hard to assess how the process was going because you didn't want to take

548
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,200
the punch to make a matrix, to put it in the mold, to make the type, to put the type in

549
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,920
the press, to put ink on the type and then make a piece of paper.

550
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,760
Even back then it was an ordeal to get your work into production.

551
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,000
So instead what the punch cutter would do is that they would simply put the punch into

552
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,360
the flame of a candle to coat it with soot and press that onto a piece of paper which

553
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,520
gave them a really nice black forward reading image of the letter they were working on that

554
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,120
was really easy to clean off.

555
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,600
The word they used for that process was the same as the word we use today for a quick

556
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,640
assessment of our work in progress.

557
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,760
It's a smoke test.

558
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,920
I know there are other etymologies of the term.

559
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,840
I think this is the right one.

560
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,000
Fight me.

561
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,880
Okay.

562
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,080
So now once the punch cutters done their work and they've made all the type, what happens

563
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,880
is that a person called a typesetter would stand at a wooden tray full of type.

564
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,120
They'd make lines of type starting from the bottom moving up, upside down, and reading

565
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:09,920
backwards to produce all the letters, the text that had to go into the press.

566
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,400
They would stand at a workstation that looked kind of like this with these wooden trays

567
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,120
full of chunks of metal.

568
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,720
Let's look at how that's laid out.

569
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,520
So the little letters were at the bottom tray and the capital letters were at the top

570
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,520
tray except they didn't call them trays, they called them cases.

571
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,400
This was the upper case and that was the lower case and that's why you call them that today.

572
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,200
So remember a case insensitive regex is one which doesn't care whether the chunks of metal

573
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,460
come out of the bottom wooden tray or the top wooden tray.

574
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,840
Let's look at the layout of the lower case.

575
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,280
So the lower case had an ergonomic layout where the most common letters were at the

576
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,360
center of the tray in large compartments with less and less common letters in smaller

577
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,720
compartments headed out towards the edges so that the typesetter's movements would be

578
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,100
very, everything would be right where they needed to be.

579
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:06,400
If you look at the layout of the upper case, it goes from A to Z but with J and U at the

580
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
end.

581
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,580
Now, I want you to stop and think for a moment.

582
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,800
How are you feeling right now?

583
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,840
I just did something, here's the reason why I'm talking about Gutenberg.

584
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,600
I wanted to talk about some technology that I think most of you would have been unfamiliar

585
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
with.

586
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,320
I wanted you to all be newbies in this technology and I wanted to throw a lot of information

587
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,500
at you really fast.

588
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,880
I wanted to throw in some weird digressions where you weren't sure, is this important

589
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,880
smoke test?

590
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
Do I need to remember that?

591
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,880
Is this going to be on the test?

592
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,960
I don't know what I need to pay attention to here.

593
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,800
And we'd end up getting to a point where we see something so odd that it seems like it

594
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,840
must have been done intentionally to annoy us.

595
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,120
Why are J and U at the end?

596
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,680
Why not put them, it can't be based on the common, how common the letters are.

597
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,840
J is way more common than an X or a Q in capital letters, right?

598
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,080
And the reason I'm talking about this is that we talked a bunch about sentiment but even

599
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:05,320
the information in our messages to people can be difficult and we have to take that

600
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,320
into account.

601
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,200
And I'll talk a little bit more about that just to close the loop.

602
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,600
The reason J and U are at the end in the uppercase is that J and U were not considered

603
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,620
distinct letters in the English language until the mid 1600s, which meant that the layout

604
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:24,840
of the uppercase had been in use for 200 years by the time that J and U had to be added to

605
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:30,360
it and rather than disturb centuries of tradition, they were just added at the end.

606
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,200
And they remain there to this day.

607
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,680
If you visit a letterpress shop today, the uppercase is still laid out like this.

608
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:42,660
So the next time you want to whine about your legacy systems and backwards compatibility,

609
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,160
go and talk to these guys.

610
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,820
Okay.

611
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,080
But Python is also strange.

612
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,720
I last year's keynote, Ruka Ashlanga said, if you don't say something controversial in

613
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,480
a keynote, are you really living your best life?

614
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,480
I don't know.

615
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,480
Is this controversial?

616
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,560
Lambda is a terrible keyword.

617
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,920
It has no mnemonic value.

618
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,880
There's a historical reason, but it doesn't really come up that often and it doesn't help

619
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,840
people remember what's going on.

620
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,560
And I'm saying this not to say that Python is bad.

621
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,560
Python is technology.

622
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,940
Technology gets weird over time.

623
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,980
It starts weird and it gets weirder.

624
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,280
And that's just the way technology is.

625
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,720
And that's something that we deal with.

626
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:33,160
When we're talking to people, we're talking about technology and that weirdness can interfere

627
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,880
with our ability to communicate well with people and we need to take that into account.

628
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,360
We love to show people this XKCD cartoon because it's all about how Python is really great.

629
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:47,320
We're not so fond of showing them this cartoon because it's about how Python can be confusing.

630
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,960
And I'm not showing this cartoon to talk about packaging or installation mechanisms or to

631
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,560
say that Python is bad.

632
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,400
Python is technology.

633
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,920
And technology starts weird and gets weirder.

634
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,000
And that's just the way it is.

635
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,280
Right?

636
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,200
We talk about how Python is easy and it is compared but only compared to other programming

637
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,200
languages.

638
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,400
It's still a programming language.

639
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,160
It's still weird.

640
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,240
You may know what some of these words on the left-hand column mean.

641
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,180
I know what most of them mean.

642
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,880
You may know what some of the ones in the middle mean.

643
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,960
I know what most of those mean.

644
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,880
I have no idea what any of the words in this right-hand column mean.

645
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,880
Right?

646
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,300
Python has been hugely successful, which means that two experts in Python can have very little

647
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,620
terminology in common about the things they're actually dealing with day to day.

648
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,140
And that can also interfere with our ability to communicate.

649
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,940
So we need to provide context.

650
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,060
We need to understand that those difficulties are going to arise.

651
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,460
And we need to help smooth over those differences.

652
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:54,900
And it's not just Python.

653
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,380
I didn't think that was going to be the biggest joke in the talk.

654
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,580
But there it is.

655
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,520
All technology is weird.

656
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,580
It's all weird.

657
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,420
And we can't get away from it.

658
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,580
We can try to smooth off some of it, but we'll never get rid of all of it.

659
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,980
We have to deal with how we talk about it.

660
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:15,200
So, for example, someone might say Python is hard.

661
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,700
And we as Python advocates and lovers of Python, and we want to help this person, we want to

662
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,140
be enthusiastic and optimistic, we might say no, it's easy.

663
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,060
This sentence literally starts with no.

664
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:31,300
This helper is contradicting the questioner who will now decide I am stupid.

665
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:35,940
I am having difficulty with a thing that is famously easy.

666
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,340
Therefore I am stupid.

667
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,500
Even if you say it's one of the easier languages, I'm still stupid.

668
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Right?

669
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,500
I didn't understand.

670
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,660
I can't do one of the easier languages.

671
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,980
Instead, you should listen to what they're saying.

672
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,820
Because this person's got a sentence, the subject of which is Python, but that's not

673
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,820
really what they're saying.

674
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,860
What they're saying is I am struggling.

675
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:01,020
And if you know that what they're saying is that they're struggling, then you can help

676
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,020
them.

677
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,020
It can be hard at first.

678
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,740
Yeah, it can be hard at first, but we can help.

679
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,460
It goes better.

680
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,940
And experts have this problem too.

681
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:15,940
So, right, I've been talking about these examples with a newbie and a helper, but the same is

682
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,540
true of experts.

683
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,540
Right?

684
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:24,660
If I start work at Metta and have to jump into their monolith, I'm a newbie.

685
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,660
Right?

686
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,420
And the first thing I'm going to think is I don't get it.

687
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,940
And my imposter syndrome is going to kick in, and I'm going to feel like, okay, this

688
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,940
was a huge mistake, and someone's going to have to help me, and we're going to be talking

689
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:38,940
about the same things as Python is hard, but with much bigger words and much longer sentences

690
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:44,220
and much longer conversations.

691
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,020
As we like to say in Boston Python, we are all beginners.

692
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,380
It's just that some of us have more practice.

693
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,220
One of the characteristics of being an expert is that when you get to that stumbling block,

694
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,780
you know you've been there many times before, and you probably have some skills to get yourself

695
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:04,060
past it, but everyone's a beginner at something.

696
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,060
Python is big.

697
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,540
Python is changing.

698
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,940
I don't know how to use pep669 that's coming out.

699
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,140
There's going to be peps after that.

700
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,300
I'm going to have to be the beginner at that again.

701
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,860
We all have to do it all the time, and we have to feel okay about our interactions.

702
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:23,020
We have to help each other.

703
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:29,340
It doesn't help that the world now looks like this.

704
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,420
We're all sitting at our screens.

705
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,740
Things are flying by.

706
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:38,180
I know there are days where I'm at home working remotely, and I feel like an air traffic controller

707
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,900
just trying to make sure that none of the planes crash.

708
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,380
Stuff's just flying around.

709
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:49,100
It's really easy in those moments to think there are a lot of notifications when really

710
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,460
what's happening is there are a lot of people.

711
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:57,060
Every one of those notifications is a person talking to you, and you might want to just

712
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:02,860
quick respond to something, and that's the exact opposite of use more words.

713
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:10,780
I literally have keyboard macros to help me insert softening phrases into my responses.

714
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:16,500
I can type four keystrokes and have a sentence that starts with, if you don't mind me asking,

715
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:22,900
comma, which puts me, it levels the playing field, it gives a little bit of humility,

716
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:29,140
it gives the other person that asks permission to ask my question, and that just helps the

717
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,660
conversation go.

718
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:40,620
Lastly, one engineering technique that we have, we all know how sprints work.

719
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:45,900
You make some goals, you do a bunch of work, and then you assess how it went, you consider

720
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,220
what went well, what could have been done better, and then you repeat.

721
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,460
You can do the same thing with your messages.

722
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,100
This guy says, my singleton is hard to test.

723
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,420
You're doing it wrong.

724
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:04,180
I did mention IRC before, right?

725
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,180
Okay.

726
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,500
I'll ask someone else.

727
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:13,380
This angry person probably genuinely felt like they want to help people, but it didn't

728
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,380
work.

729
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:18,340
The technique they used to help that person did not help that person.

730
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,100
It made that person leave.

731
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,860
And a little bit of reflection, what was I trying to accomplish?

732
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,940
How did I try to accomplish it?

733
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,300
Did it work?

734
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,720
I don't mean like every Slack message you're going to stop and have a little retro with

735
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:38,800
a wiki page or something, but having that sort of attention to how things are going,

736
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:45,040
treating this as an interaction that is valuable and you wanted to go well and how could it

737
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,920
go better next time is an engineering skill that you can apply to your people interactions

738
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,800
so that they'll be better.

739
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:01,040
It all comes down to this.

740
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,240
People are important.

741
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,000
Our interactions with people are important.

742
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,440
Whatever we do technically, like you might be able to write the best program ever and

743
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,480
debug the hardest problems, if you can't actually work with the person sitting next to you or

744
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,160
hear what your customer needs or figure out how to please your boss so that you get that

745
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:25,200
raise, it doesn't amount to much.

746
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,200
And by the way, I've had only a short time here.

747
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,280
We've really only just scratched the surface.

748
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,840
There are tons of more complex factors that come into all this.

749
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,740
What if it's not two people talking?

750
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,120
What if it's ten people in a meeting room?

751
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,680
What if there's an actual power imbalance because I'm your boss?

752
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:49,020
What if I'm talking to someone and it's not going well and it is not going to get better?

753
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,060
How do I decide how to end that?

754
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,700
How do I fix a conflict that I had with a person?

755
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,640
There's lots, lots, and lots more.

756
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,520
Just like every talk at this conference is only going to be able to give you an introduction

757
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,880
to the topic and then there's a whole PhD thesis after that to become an expert, the

758
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,640
same is true of interactions with people.

759
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,560
By the way, I mentioned that I've been writing a blog since before PyCon started.

760
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,880
After my first PyCon in 2007, I wrote a post, and I didn't even go and read this post until

761
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:28,760
talk, but my advice then was talk to people at PyCon, which is just what Marietta said.

762
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:34,000
The people who are here, and by the way, this whole keynote, this might be the wrong place

763
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
to do it.

764
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,360
You've all traveled a long way at great expense to be face-to-face with people.

765
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:43,200
You're probably exactly the experts who don't need to hear this message.

766
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,280
There are people that you interact with who stayed home because they don't see the point

767
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,040
of being face-to-face with people.

768
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,680
We're the ones who need to hear this keynote, but I'm hoping you can take this message and

769
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,440
spread it widely.

770
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,320
My advice for the next few days, the same as Marietta said, talk to people.

771
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,680
We are here because we want to talk to you.

772
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,920
I want to talk to you.

773
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,040
If you see me in the hallway, come and talk to me.

774
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,520
I want to talk to you.

775
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,520
One last note.

776
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:16,920
The writer Kurt Vonnegut asked his son Mark, who's also a writer, the really big existential

777
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,600
question, what are we here for?

778
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,520
I don't mean Python developers at PyCon.

779
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,200
I mean people on earth.

780
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,320
What are we here for?

781
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,960
His son Mark did a very clever thing.

782
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:32,060
He both answered and avoided the question by saying, we are here to help each other

783
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,960
get through this thing, whatever it is.

784
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,800
That's my advice to you.

785
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,220
Help each other.

786
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,820
Talk to each other.

787
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,640
Listen to each other.

788
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,920
And help each other.

789
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,120
That's it.

790
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,120
Thank you.

791
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,720
Thank you for your attention.

792
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,080
I am at NedBat.

793
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,520
I'm on Mastodon.

794
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,640
And thank you to my illustrators.

795
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,240
Enjoy PyCon.
