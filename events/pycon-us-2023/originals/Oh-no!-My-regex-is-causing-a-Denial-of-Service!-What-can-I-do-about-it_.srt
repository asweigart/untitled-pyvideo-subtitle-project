1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I've read that and that would actually create a difference in the way we can make a difference

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,720
in the internalouting process of bang to pop culture and educating

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:25,160
How do we make that to understand on the planet why we're doing this and what we can do to

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:50,360
in the nuclear,

5
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,160
But, um, this process is something that we've been

6
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,160
testing a lot from our life too, where we don't have to

7
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,160
keep doing it, and I like to think that, you know,

8
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,160
that these things, these regular expressions,

9
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,160
that we can do, you know, these kind of methods,

10
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,160
that we can use, one of the things that we've been

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,160
doing for a long time, and I think that, you know,

12
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,160
it was really the first person who said, you know,

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,160
no, I can't, I can't do this, I can't do that,

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,160
I can't do this, I can't do that, just can't.

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,160
So, I guess, because I love the problem,

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,160
I just wanted to try to, you know,

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,160
try to get the people who were first coming through

18
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,160
these spaces.

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,160
The way I love to make friends with them,

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,160
is that some of the experiences that we've had

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,160
with our professors, that we've had in terms of

22
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,160
the process of things, and those are very, very

23
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
interesting experiences.

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
So, if they were to work with the researches,

25
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,160
and, you know, when you ask questions like this,

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,160
they would be able to answer the questions that they have.

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,160
And it was not like that.

28
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,160
You know, I'm sure many of you have heard of

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,160
the idea that the problem is the images.

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,160
And one of the things that was kind of

31
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,160
the idea was that, you know,

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,160
it was really, really interesting.

33
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,160
And it was, you know, it was nice to see

34
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
the front-line scenarios.

35
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
And you get to see what's going on in the front-line,

36
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
and you get to see what's going on in the front-line.

37
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,160
And then you realize, you know,

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,160
I guess it's the first time I've ever seen anything like this.

39
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,160
The first thing you put in your mind is,

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,160
you know, the number of expressions in the page

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,160
from the top of your head,

42
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,160
describes the number of expressions

43
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,160
that you can think of.

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,160
And then,

45
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,160
you realize that the problem is that

46
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,160
these kinds of expressions are not

47
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,160
the same as the ones that you can think of.

48
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,160
They are different.

49
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,160
So, what do you do? You know,

50
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,160
you can think of the expressions that you can think of

51
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,160
in the page, and you can think of the expressions that you can think of.

52
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,160
So, I don't know if you know the things

53
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,160
that you think are very interesting.

54
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Maybe the last time I was talking

55
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
about the last three years,

56
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,160
the last three years,

57
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,160
the first four, the first three years,

58
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,160
in this case, that

59
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,160
really didn't seem very interesting to me.

60
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,160
And I think that's what I'm trying to say now.

61
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,160
I'm just going to give you a few examples

62
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,160
of what I'm trying to say in this case.

63
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,160
So, I think that we don't have to try to

64
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,160
think of the expressions

65
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,160
that we can think of in the beginning.

66
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,160
So, if you put in the first one,

67
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,160
the one we were talking about,

68
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,160
and one we were trying to think of in the beginning,

69
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,160
of course, we need to try to think of

70
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,160
the fact that it is a bit different

71
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,160
from the other expressions.

72
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,160
And I think that

73
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,160
that's essentially why

74
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,160
I'm trying to say that it's a bit different.

75
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
But that's basically what's interesting in this case.

76
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
So, from the point of view of

77
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
how we can think of the expressions,

78
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,160
what we need to think of in the first one

79
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,160
is that we need to think of the expressions

80
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,160
that we think of in the first one.

81
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,160
And we don't need to think of the expressions in that

82
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,160
sentence, we just need to think of the expressions

83
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,160
in that sentence.

84
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,160
So, that's actually something that I'd at least try to think of

85
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,160
in the first one, and that's a bit different from the

86
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,160
first one. And there's the fact that that means

87
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,160
that we need to think of the expressions in that sentence.

88
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,160
So, that's my suggestion, but

89
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,160
I'm going to try to think of

90
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
the difference between

91
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,160
the expressions in this case

92
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,160
and the expressions in the next case.

93
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,160
And I think the second

94
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,160
example is that you need to think of the expressions

95
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,160
in the next one. And so, I'll say

96
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,000
and we have to follow this and that's how it works.

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,480
So I'm going to get to that.

98
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,120
And I'm going to be doing more of those

99
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,720
in the student engagement in the future.

100
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,320
This project is going to be very, very close to the end

101
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,040
of the year, so it's going to be very, very close.

102
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,640
So I'm going to be doing a lot of things

103
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,400
to get to that point.

104
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,600
And that's the end of the project.

105
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,200
So by the end of the year, we're going to be able

106
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,960
to get to the end of the project.

107
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,400
And if I do get to the end of the project,

108
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,520
so what happens we'll be good.

109
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,600
So I leave one part and that is the end.

110
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,140
But we'll be making more important measurements

111
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,120
in which an confidently that to say that we're moving

112
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,240
borderlines and we can go into the next step

113
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:07,240
which is

114
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,240
And the question of how to make these kinds of functions

115
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,240
possible, and we need these types of equations

116
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,240
to be able to work with more time.

117
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
And the question is, how do you make these kinds of functions

118
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
possible?

119
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
And we need to understand these things that we make

120
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
these things.

121
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
As much as possible, we need to understand them ourselves.

122
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,240
And if we forget that, we need to think about the experience.

123
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,240
And this is, of course, we can run through the world

124
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,240
once we've done a few things that we can do to make

125
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,240
these things possible.

126
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,240
And it is a very simple question.

127
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,240
The next question, and we'll get to this one,

128
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
so we'll get into the experience of the experience

129
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
of the experience of the process, and the first step

130
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,240
is to make sense of these types of functions.

131
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,240
And we'll see that in the world of the user that uses

132
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
this special language.

133
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,240
So that would involve a very complex way of doing it.

134
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
And the other part of the thing we're going to do is

135
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
we're going to take the place of the world of the user

136
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,240
and make sense of the user for the language that we're

137
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
talking about today.

138
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
We're going to make sense of the world of the user

139
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,240
out of place we must take the place of the user.

140
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
So I'll say I look at you from what you say to me,

141
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
is that if you're in the world of the user,

142
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,240
you might want to say to this friend you developed

143
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
a shred of what you're doing.

144
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,240
I mean, it's a lot of it's difficult.

145
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,240
And you can't always change and be this strong

146
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,240
in this field of thought.

147
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,240
So I think you can use the word take the place,

148
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,240
and I want you to take the place that you left.

149
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
And you can use it in a very difficult way,

150
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,240
And we will be able to implement this in the future,

151
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
in any case, as long as we can.

152
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
This is the next step.

153
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,240
Of course, we don't have the new, we don't have the new.

154
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
We probably don't have the new.

155
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,240
We don't have the new.

156
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,240
So that's the one thing we need to do.

157
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
And we will do it.

158
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,240
It's important that we develop a new strategy,

159
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,240
a new step, and we will, as I said,

160
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,240
develop a new strategy.

161
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,240
And that, again, will be a big improvement.

162
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
But you don't have to worry about the new.

163
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
I mean, we don't have to worry about the new.

164
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,240
Of course, we have to do it ourselves.

165
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
We don't have to worry about the new strategy.

166
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
We can do it ourselves.

167
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
But we have to do it ourselves.

168
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
We can do it ourselves.

169
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,240
We can do it ourselves.

170
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
But our goal is to inspire the new.

171
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,240
We're probably going to be one of the two.

172
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
And we're going to be one of the two.

173
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,240
And we're going to be one of the two.

174
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Now, of course, if this is the new,

175
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
it's going to be a new step.

176
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,240
So we're going to be able to get a new strategy

177
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,240
that is going to have a certain amount of

178
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,240
improvement and some of the certain features.

179
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
And one of the things I think that's important

180
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,240
is that we need to be able to do it.

181
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,240
We need to be able to make it so that we can

182
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,240
have a new strategy that is so strong

183
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,240
and that we can have a number of steps that we need to take

184
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
to get it to work.

185
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
So, the first thing we need to do is to

186
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
develop a strategy that is going to be

187
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
a new strategy.

188
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
And that is to start with a new strategy

189
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
that is going to be a new strategy.

190
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
And once we have this strategy, we might

191
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
have the opportunity to take the new strategy

192
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
and make it so that we can do it.

193
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
And we can do it ourselves.

194
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
And we can do it ourselves.

195
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
So, let's see what happens.

196
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
I think that's a great thing to do.

197
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
I think that's a great thing to do.

198
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
We need to be able to make it so that we can

199
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
go ahead with what's going on in the world.

200
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
You know that phrase,

201
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
when we make the main decision,

202
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
it's not just about the things that we need to do.

203
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
What we need to do is to make sure

204
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
we're going to take the steps that we need to take

205
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
in order to be able to take the next step

206
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
in the direction that we need to take

207
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
and in the direction that we need to take.

208
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
And I think that's one of the things

209
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
that is important for me to do

210
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
is to be able to take the steps that

211
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
we need to take in order to be able to

212
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,820
But there are tasks which are

213
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,220
very very important for getting them

214
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,520
to be there to help you quite a bit.

215
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,860
So, without any pauses,

216
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,340
the result of these tasks

217
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,160
really just means that at the moment

218
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:20,420
these are actually the sandstone

219
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,420
And this is something that's coming,

220
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,420
that's coming, that's coming out of this

221
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,420
and I'm going to show you some examples of it here.

222
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,420
And I'll show you some examples of the way that I've done

223
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,420
this song again, and I'm going to show you some examples.

224
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,420
This is the original version of the song,

225
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,420
this is the original version of the song,

226
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,420
and I'm going to show you some examples.

227
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,420
The first one is called,

228
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,420
Lights, and it's a song that I wrote in the early 90s.

229
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,420
This is a song that's a bit older,

230
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,420
but it's a bit more current and it's quite funny.

231
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,420
We did the same on awareness,

232
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,420
and now yeah, exposure has been reduced

233
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,420
like four times, so we've got experience this time.

234
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,420
It's been personalized.

235
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,420
So� din bla, jur din bla,

236
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,420
And then we're shown of it

237
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,420
It's been bubbled and sent in a same way

238
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,420
and we're shown in the same way

239
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,420
It represents awareness of its lyrics,

240
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,420
and that's what we're doing on this song,

241
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
And we're showing this in the same way

242
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,420
we've done on Lightning,

243
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,420
and it's been substituted with Jim Lite,

244
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,420
that gives them the device in the song,

245
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,420
trying to fix it with the community,

246
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,420
but we have to do it with the local government.

247
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,920
It's kind of like the extreme scenario.

248
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,420
It is simple.

249
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,420
It's not really a big problem.

250
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,920
It's not really a challenge.

251
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,420
It's a huge problem.

252
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
And the other thing is that we have to focus

253
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,420
on the extension of the law.

254
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,420
And that's the biggest problem.

255
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,420
That is the biggest thing that's going to happen

256
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,420
if this law is going to be in effect.

257
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,920
The other thing is that we have to work

258
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,420
on the extension of the law.

259
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
And the next one is going to be in effect.

260
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,420
It's easy.

261
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
But this doesn't mean that it's fast

262
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
and it's not really as easy as it does

263
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,420
when it comes to it.

264
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
At the first point in time, we now have

265
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
a new, different law.

266
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,420
Because we have fixed the country in the end.

267
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,920
Now that we have fixed the country in the end,

268
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
it's time to change the law.

269
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Step by step, it's going to be a problem for the country.

270
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
So, it's going to be difficult

271
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
to change the law.

272
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,920
So, we have to focus on the extension of the law.

273
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
And the next one is going to be in effect.

274
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,420
It's going to be a big problem.

275
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,920
It's going to be a huge problem.

276
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
And the next one is going to be in effect.

277
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,420
Now, it's going to be one of the first problems

278
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,920
in this country.

279
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
It's going to be one of the first problems.

280
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
So, the other thing is that

281
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
in the next one, what happens

282
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
is that it's going to be a big problem.

283
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
We need one or two different kinds of problems.

284
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
And that's going to be the biggest problem.

285
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
And we're going to be working on

286
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,920
how to fix the country.

287
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
And we have to work on the things we need to do.

288
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
It's going to be a challenge for a strong country.

289
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,920
And that's a problem.

290
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,920
And it's fine.

291
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,920
We don't need a set of laws.

292
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
The set of laws are going to be the same thing.

293
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
The set of laws,

294
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
they don't really fit into the problem.

295
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,920
But we do need a lot of laws.

296
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
The laws are going to be a challenge for a strong country.

297
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,920
We don't need laws.

298
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
And that's what we need to do.

299
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:16,760
that's what Canada has been doing since they started.

300
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,920
It's an own project and is taking that culture and responsibility

301
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,820
from the 90th century till the new 40th century.

302
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,420
But we still have 쓸ам 차 לש with global entrepreneurs

303
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,420
And so we're trying to figure out what is the best way to do this.

304
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,420
So we're trying to find the combination.

305
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,420
We're trying to figure out the same way.

306
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:51,420
And the only thing that's different is the difference between the space and the world.

307
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,420
And that's like this.

308
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,420
We think that the simple thing is to just build a space.

309
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,420
And that's it.

310
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,420
And that's the difference between the space and the world.

311
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,420
And so we're trying to figure out how to do this.

312
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,420
And that's it.

313
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,420
And so that's the basic matrix for this.

314
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,420
And that's the purpose.

315
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,420
So instead of going out and looking up to the Earth in the distance,

316
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,420
instead of going to the Sun, we're going to go to the Earth in the distance

317
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,420
and that's the basic matrix.

318
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,420
So we're trying to figure out what is the best way to do this.

319
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,420
And so that's the main purpose.

320
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,420
And so the basic matrix is to see the ways which we can make a big difference in our world.

321
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,420
And that's the specific matrix for this.

322
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,420
And that's it.

323
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,420
And this is the basic matrix for the different sectors and the different spaces.

324
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,420
And what we're doing is that we're thinking in this space we're thinking in a different way.

325
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,420
And that's how we're going to find the differences between the space and the world.

326
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,420
And that's the basic matrix for the different spaces.

327
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,420
And that's the basic matrix.

328
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,420
So now we know what the problem is.

329
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:02,420
So that's our initial idea of the basic matrix, and this is a couple prol interests for we're to get introduced into our problems.

330
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,420
The first is the basic matrix, the elements which is what we want to see.

331
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,420
Because sometimes the language is just spelled out, things are just not translated.

332
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:15,420
And sometimes in this case our language is just memorized or logo for,

333
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,420
and that's where the complex is in thery.

334
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,420
The next thing for me is how to make the references, the throwarettes in Big allowance,

335
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,420
that the case forms.

336
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,420
and doing an experimental experience,

337
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,420
seeing whether that experimental experience is safe for the next generation.

338
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,420
And then you have a lot of practice.

339
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,420
And this is something that we've done recently,

340
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,420
we've been doing a lot of this, and we've been doing it for a long time.

341
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,420
And it's been really exciting, and I'm sure it's been exciting for you.

342
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,420
This is a really important project,

343
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,420
and one of the things that we've done for the last couple of decades.

344
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,420
And this is what we've done for the past 15 years,

345
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,420
is we've done this for the first time.

346
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,420
And we're excited about this, especially for the next generation.

347
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,420
And this is something that we've done for the first time,

348
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,420
and we've done it for a long time.

349
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,420
This is part of our presentation, in which we've been doing it for a long time.

350
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,420
So it's been really interesting.

351
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,420
Here are the final pieces of this presentation.

352
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,420
So, the first piece is of the presentation, I guess, for the summer.

353
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,420
So, that's a little bit more of a research of the next generation.

354
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,420
So, as we've seen, we've done this for the last couple of decades.

355
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,420
And we've done it for the next generation, too.

356
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,420
And I think it's been really interesting,

357
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,420
and I think it's been really interesting for the last couple of decades.

358
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,420
So, what I'd like to invite the team to do,

359
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,420
and I think this is the best thing,

360
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,420
is to give these people a little bit of a credit,

361
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,420
so they can learn a little bit more about this,

362
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,420
and it would be easy for them to actually finish it.

363
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,420
And we're going to show them the work that we've done.

364
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,420
So, the research that we've done is not something that's been comprised of the research

365
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,420
that we've done, which is, for instance,

366
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,420
mapping numbers for samples of the samples.

367
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,420
And the research that we've done is a bit more complex.

368
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,420
So, it's not just being a big work,

369
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,420
it's being a big experiment, a work to put it simply.

370
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,420
And we've seen that we've been doing a lot of research,

371
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,420
and we've done a lot of research into the data.

372
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,420
And so, it's been really interesting,

373
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,420
and I think it's been really interesting,

374
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,420
and this is really one of the reasons that we've been working

375
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,420
with the research and the scientific industry,

376
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,420
where we have these findings that we've been working on,

377
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,420
and I think one of the reasons for doing this work is the data.

378
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,420
Another part of the challenge,

379
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,420
and I think it's a challenge for the research that we've done,

380
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,420
is to understand the research.

381
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,420
So, in this case, we have the work that we've done,

382
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,420
and this is really interesting.

383
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,420
It's really interesting to look at,

384
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,420
and it's kind of a really interesting experiment as well.

385
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,420
And in this case, I want to start by explaining

386
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,420
how this kind of data is created, and how this data works.

387
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,420
And I think it's really important to understand how this data works,

388
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,420
and how it's processed, and how it's processed.

389
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,420
So, today we have two samples that are found

390
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,420
in the same sample, and we're going to be looking at the same one,

391
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,420
which I think is a really interesting experiment,

392
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,420
and I think it's really important to understand how it works.

393
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,420
So, those are some of the main things.

394
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,420
Now the next, first, I'm going to give you a little bit more of the

395
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,420
information.

396
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,420
Now, let's take a quick look at what we've done,

397
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,420
and then we're going to look at the research that we've done,

398
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,420
and instead we're looking at the research that we've done,

399
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,420
and how we've done this.

400
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,420
So, let's talk about the study.

401
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,420
We've started with a study specifically for the state of Southampton.

402
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:44,420
And the next step is to create a service for a company that will support those characters.

403
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,420
We see the work that we do here at the FIBS is we collect funds, work stuff, work stuff,

404
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,420
and then we collect it. And we start collecting it.

405
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,420
We're just going to do it in one month. It's very simple.

406
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,420
We're just going to do it in a few months. And we're just going to do it in a few months.

407
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,420
And we're just going to do it in a few months.

408
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:07,420
And we go to the beginning of the first half of the year, and we spend a lot of money on things that we need.

409
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:12,420
We're going to do a quadratic program on some things.

410
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,420
Of course, it's really a disaster.

411
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:21,420
So, to work on a program that doesn't need to be integrated, and we're going to do it in a few months,

412
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,420
instead of spending a lot of money on things that we need to do,

413
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,420
we're going to get paid to do a program that is going to be a lot more interesting than it's going to be.

414
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,420
And it's going to be a lot more fun.

415
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,420
Now, it was not until the start of the year that we got to the point where we started to be able to do things

416
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:41,420
at Facebook. We were able to figure out the best way possible,

417
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,420
a few details we just needed to...

418
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,420
three of the things that we've been able to do is create a website for consists of this program,

419
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,920
and that was the first thing I worked on at SCANF was to make this a bit more interesting

420
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,920
because all of this, you can look at this and just find out what kind of projects we did

421
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,920
So, let's start with this project I think, which isП giderately less complex,

422
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,920
which is thenesdays, we have thousands of Thursdays coming in from all over the country.

423
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,920
So, zero-task is the range that we expect to access the right edge.

424
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,920
And it's a logical problem to be in the right space.

425
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Since we don't have an exceptional type of space,

426
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,920
we can't really do anything about that.

427
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,920
That doesn't mean that the space is not used.

428
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,920
It's very much a matter of space.

429
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,920
But, you know, it's a thing that we need to be able to access that.

430
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,920
And that's the basic idea.

431
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,920
But, when we look at the physical user, for example,

432
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,920
we can see for example, how fast we can reach the surface.

433
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,920
But, in the world, the first thing that we expect from the space of the ages

434
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,920
is the sum of these things, but it's not easy.

435
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,920
And we have to be expected to be able to do something that is possible.

436
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,920
And that's what we need to do.

437
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
And that's why we need to be able to do things like that.

438
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,920
So, now that we've worked out the idea that we're using,

439
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,920
what is it doing exactly?

440
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Then, of course, we can do it.

441
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,920
So, what we want to try to do is to go in a way that allows us to find the space.

442
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
But, there's quite a bit of room.

443
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
And so, we need to be able to find that space.

444
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,920
And that's what we need to do in space.

445
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,920
And this, I think, is a very important aspect of the physical space.

446
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,920
And that's what we need to do.

447
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,920
And that's what we need to do.

448
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,920
And we want that space to exist within the physical space.

449
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,920
And that's what we need to do.

450
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,920
And, of course, we need to be able to do things like that.

451
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
And that's what we need to do.

452
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
And that's what we need to do.

453
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
And that's what we need to do.

454
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
And that's what we need to do.

455
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
And that's what we need to do.

456
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,920
And that's what we need to do.

457
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
And that's what we need to do.

458
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,920
And that's what we need to do.

459
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,920
And that's what we need to do.

460
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,920
And that's what we need to do.

461
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,920
And that's what we need to do.

462
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,920
And that's what we need to do.

463
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,920
Butterfly Reasonings

464
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,440
This question is that if you're overindulged in a movement of

465
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,160
Ьndl teams that you just mentioned and wanted to

466
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,320
destrodi some elements created specifically for them.

467
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,880
And I hate to say anti-historic elements.

468
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,000
But there's a great level of dynasty

469
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
in some ways that were oxygenated.

470
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,640
But a few changes haven't been taken away from Animal

471
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,320
Studies at home and those settings aren't that important.

472
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,320
They are more of like the Schulen of the shells.

473
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,520
Some are alien MODS like to be happened to,

474
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,280
from the��게요 building and penal rested building.

475
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
to do.

476
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
That's the only way to do it.

477
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
Now, if you're running a platform,

478
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
we're going to remind you that this is a

479
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
technology-operated system that

480
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
is designed to most maintain

481
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
a more sustainable environment

482
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
and to have a more sustainable

483
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
infrastructure for the use

484
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
of applications for the

485
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
use of applications inside.

486
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,280
So, what I'm going to say to you is

487
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
that we're going to be using a specific

488
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
platform, so this is a platform

489
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
we can use for the use

490
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
of applications.

491
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
We're not just making a platform

492
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
and that's why we're going to use it.

493
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
We're going to look for

494
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,280
the platform to find the solution that

495
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,280
we can use as we go across the board

496
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
because the more you work in the

497
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,280
industry, the faster you can do something

498
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
and the more you can do is our

499
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
right track system. The grid lines

500
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,280
are the inside of the control panel

501
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,280
which we defined earlier.

502
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,280
But, suppose we use the

503
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
grid lines, then we expect the

504
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
grid lines to be the same size

505
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,280
and we need to match this

506
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,280
the grid lines. The grid lines

507
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
are the same size and we need to

508
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
match the grid lines to each other.

509
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
And what we're going to do is

510
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
we're going to be using something

511
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,280
different to find the solution that

512
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,280
we've never seen before in the

513
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,280
industry. And we're going to use

514
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
this to achieve that.

515
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
So, what I'm going to show you is

516
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,280
that we're going to be using

517
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
a different system that's a bit

518
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
different from the one we used in

519
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,280
the industry. And when we do that,

520
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
we're going to be using

521
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,280
a different system that's a bit

522
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,280
different from the one we used in

523
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
the industry. And what we're going to

524
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
do is use the grid lines

525
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
that are the same size

526
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,280
and we need to match

527
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,280
this to each other

528
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
because we don't want the grid lines

529
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,280
to be the same size.

530
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
We want the grid lines to be the same

531
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,280
size, not the same size.

532
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:37,740
I don't think the

533
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,740
and the first step of that is to make sense.

534
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,740
We've been doing this since 1966,

535
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,740
since the first time we did it.

536
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,740
Since then we've been testing it for years.

537
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,740
So the first thing we do is we're going to be doing

538
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,740
a lot of things in one place,

539
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,740
like print, internet, everything.

540
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,740
So we've got something specific.

541
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,740
But what we're going to do is we're going to start doing

542
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,740
the most important thing, and that's going to be

543
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,740
the last thing we're going to do.

544
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,740
We're going to write programs and whatever we need

545
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,740
to start doing these things.

546
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,740
We're supposed to have three different things

547
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,740
to go through and test, but in the end,

548
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,740
it's going to be the last thing.

549
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,740
Then finally, we're going to have to test three different

550
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,740
things, and we're going to start doing it for a year.

551
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,740
Again, there's a lot to do in this game,

552
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,740
and we're going to do it, but it's a different thing.

553
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,740
We're going to do it in a different direction,

554
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,740
but it's a different way to do it.

555
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,740
So we're going to be doing it in a different way,

556
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,740
and that's the reason why this is worth it.

557
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,740
So we're going to do it,

558
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,740
and it's pretty much the problem of this one.

559
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,740
Of course, we have to try to find the best way

560
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,740
to do this program, and we're going to try

561
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,740
to do this in a different way.

562
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,740
So we're going to try to get through

563
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,740
that process, and then we're going to do

564
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,740
it with the most basic importance,

565
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,740
and then we're going to do it.

566
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,740
So finally, we're going to do it

567
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,740
in a different direction, and the way to do it

568
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,740
is to try to catch the first one as soon as possible.

569
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,740
The transfer is the second step to the second

570
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,740
step, and we're going to try to get to the

571
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,740
last step, the third accountant as well,

572
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,740
as we can.

573
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,740
She said, we're going to haverag

574
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,220
an authentic line Google Share to a

575
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,520
fine person on our collection.

576
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
And in Language theme,

577
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,520
we're going to focus on international standards.

578
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,520
Your scrambling for something as

579
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,840
stringent as your own language terms.

580
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,840
So, because sometimes it gives you

581
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,840
certain "... เึ Ladies,

582
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,840
look at my notes."

583
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,540
are still included but there are 3 expenses

584
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,120
that we're different, but that must be

585
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,760
determined by itself.

586
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,860
On the paper, there is the elsewhere

587
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,960
constraint between the destruction of structures

588
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,840
over time.

589
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,280
But if you ask the volume of the Business History

590
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,640
the palm will probablyodirection about the damage

00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,880

tons of voices José And поэтому estamos tenidos a ustedes

el

595
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,880
These casinos are ended upDR both like your talks can actually form,

596
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,840
and the jamming could be so vocals were there to actually

597
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,680
다ح At the time the Hasta Vzen COMEX was

598
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:49,020
호캠 LP onwards and again on the

599
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:53,020
And that's why we have three thousands at our institute.

600
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,940
Do you know how many thousands that have been approved for this work?

601
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,940
Number two?

602
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,940
Every ten yeas.

603
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,020
Q. Of course there have been millions of 노�70s that have

604
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,020
resisted this work.

605
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,020
A. flipped it,lining it, forced it, pushed it.

606
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,020
That's the final press result.

607
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,020
Q. And are there White Blues?

608
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,020
A. doing that.

609
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,020
Q. How can you say this?

610
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,260
A. Approved.

611
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,260
From what the press says…

612
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,260
G. revenue interest spending!

613
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,280
A. lacommerce spending.

614
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,720
Q. how can we tell that not everyone is who they

615
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
think they are?

616
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
A. When we had our president Flash.

617
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
Thanks a lot, stress.

618
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,660
First of all we already had about forty

619
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,600
not doing things that are not indefiniteito nearly acceptable,

620
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,760
which again is serious,

621
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,400
it's totally Thanks you.

622
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,660
It goes and really with is a positive assessment,

623
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,720
a real difference of work,

624
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,740
in that to focus on ways that we can need

625
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,160
this partiality into interest.

626
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,140
With interest, I often thought I'm not yet.

627
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,400
But if I'd like, if I wanted that interest

628
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,480
is the sohut and what they're called religious communities.

629
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,260
Again, what happened here?

630
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,580
Absolutely, there were

631
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,540
sort of large uneven Denis 때는.

632
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,600
And, yes, you get an overonen Gwen Banker.

633
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
And so, I'm just realizing,

634
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,600
Ceiglus loves financials.

635
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,580
I'm just realizing that.

636
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,500
So, what?

637
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,180
Since we didn't have any social media,

638
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,560
and there were no social networks,

639
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:06,980
and so what we're supposed to do is

640
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,180
propel countries by other forces.

641
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,180
So I'm just trying too.

642
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,400
I mean, the re消 largest reveres

643
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,140
not only for me but in this case,

644
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,000
but TV.

645
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,880
And so, we have film called

646
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,080
Fruit飲.

647
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,780
It's a festival

648
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,020
that we call eat best.

649
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,440
viewed as a way of emotional activity.

650
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
It simply consumer來了 an inspiration.

651
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,760
I think that is what billionaires look at,

652
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,640
and that's something that's really obvious.

653
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,180
So would people is going to impact

654
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,960
it's amount of external and internal attention

655
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,020
to reforestation of things?

656
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,400
Develop a regular expression,

657
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,980
line to an objective,

658
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,900
and unpack certainAm傳 disappointed

659
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,320
We make itweisen must.

660
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,500
Because in eskimo the earth is exercised according

661
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,600
to Nietzsche'semale law to protect,

662
00:28:51,600 --> 00:29:06,780
as my sister says, the

663
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,180
mother tongue wants her law Captain tires lawyers

664
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,020
So all these relationships,

665
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,180
it could be the panel,

666
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,740
it could be the

667
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,280
school council,

668
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
it could be the

669
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,420
other before school,

670
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,620
it could be the

671
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,580
other, it's possible

672
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:20,980
that French students

673
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,260
blo delivered

674
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,880

bit odd six or it seems

678
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,180
to always as a

681
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,300
you see.

682
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,460

these are the

686
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,020
very few

687
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,940
such new

688
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,580
conversations

689
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:38,900
that you would
