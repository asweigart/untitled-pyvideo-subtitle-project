1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
it's people they were out in the world,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,420
even the climate is what they were dealing with.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,040
So these are the aspects that I have been

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,100
making certain examples of very specific

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,680
and specific tension.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,920
I've worked with stocks people to find

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,360
whether they put to use them on the side

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,560
as questions and theoretical questions.

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,580
So those

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,420
small黨 people,

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,400
which they have such that you would not

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,840
think of it as afraid that it is sharing

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,840
that Idoing does not bring as drinkable a heavy medicine on such as god's power.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:46,260
There is no medical wire 지금 strandereers, so we're also inciting among our dynamic

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,640
countries around the world that convince people not based on seeds of red,

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,000
southern and northern developing countries.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,340
Yes.

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,440
What I've really come out to say is that so if individuals

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,440
not knowing the reasons for how jargon can make a decisions,

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,500
a resourceful way of finding a way of finding those

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,040
누ladı's issues pertains to the digital

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,400
information system is very critical to who you handle

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,620
those problems and what methods and guidelines

24
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,320
may need to be down for the consumer wür entender

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,660
those alternatives.

26
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,980
Michael has also mentioned this idea

27
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,080
of a CDMS or a CR pure product system,

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,360
And it's a very interesting thing.

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,160
I think the question that people have got

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,400
and it's a very interesting question.

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,360
It's the question of the importance of the internet

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,440
and the importance of the internet.

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,760
So it's very important for us to understand

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,600
the needs of the internet and the needs of the internet.

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,080
And it's why we're doing that.

36
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,280
We're doing it to make it a technical business.

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,840
One of the things that we're doing is

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,480
that there's no energy balance in the sector

39
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,480
to transform the world of the services.

40
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,800
We've got billions of tax payers,

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,720
tax payers from conferences,

42
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,040
tax payers from the public,

43
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,040
and funds that are being used to pay for

44
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,840
tax payers from the internet.

45
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,840
And so it's very important for us

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,840
to understand the needs of the internet.

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,480
And it's also important for others

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,000
that the internet has a big influence on us.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And so I think that it's important for us

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
to understand the needs of the internet.

51
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,040
And this is very important for the people in the world.

52
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,680
It's important for the people in the country

53
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,360
to understand the needs of the internet.

54
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,800
It's important for us

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,640
to understand how we need technology and collaboration

56
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,800
for the раз.

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,360
And you are the thing that is championing this thing.

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,760
And so it's very important that

59
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,880
we pay attention to these things.

60
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,180
So that professional citizens Ayassin

61
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,040
as he was saying this morning,

62
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,200
does this not

63
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,400
force us into this big success?

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,480
...these latte making processes and everything to it.

65
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,500
And that is at the end of the day,

66
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,580
I wish you a happy Deep Home year with no misses

67
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,380
I wish you a pretty happy Deep Home Year!

68
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,820

And then someone will see some of this216,

82
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,540
one of whom has come up,

83
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,700
which I thinklaughter was here before,

84
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,060
I meanreuss claimed this that

85
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,460
if someone went in and tried to break photographs into

86
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,820
two quarters of a tape,

87
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,340
anyone who intellectualally could try to break photographs

88
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,780
in two quarters for a photo like this,

89
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,300
is really not approximately asMary Miss

90
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,460
because there's a whole shortly

if a newspaper prove the history of fake news

92
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,480
is it's important for us to have choice to use this tool to achieve that.

93
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,480
So, the number of the tools that we're using,

94
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,480
that we're going to use for the special use of our companies,

95
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,480
that we're going to use for the first time in the future,

96
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,480
is it's important for companies to use the tools that we're using

97
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,480
to make sure that our companies are able to use them.

98
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,480
But, it's important for us to use the tools that we're going to use

99
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,480
to make sure that our companies no longer suffer from biasmatic issues.

100
00:04:45,480 --> 00:05:09,280
And, of course, we want to ensure you know that my

101
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,180
and he just says, well, I still can also work out some

102
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:30,220
type of

103
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,760
consequences.

104
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,600

and tries to make food purely safe and такие

106
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,400
They just left completely and they didn't do anything else.

107
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,620
But they do think about a concept of mult�—

showed interest in the practitioners for the first time.

109
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,820
But there is another they addressed,

110
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,800
that frankly, is yet to be of great interest and what it interests them the most,

111
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,060
because they have never done anything for themselves.

there is not a lot of

116
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,500
time to do all this but

117
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,020
there's a Tesla

118
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,960
that you can

119
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,820
go to there, that's

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,960
totally involves

in place, politicals, climate change and so forth.

150
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,860
That's a question I'd like to look

151
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,140
at as a response from the world's public.

152
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,780
As part of some laboratory,

153
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:52,900
to look at how its projection can be

154
00:07:52,900 --> 00:08:07,120
So thanks to American

155
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,800
And this is just a way to make it a little bit more simple.

156
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,480
It's not that it's a simple step.

157
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,200
It can be a little bit more complicated

158
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,840
or a little bit more rational than it is a simple step.

159
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,920
So that was my point.

160
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,520
I'm going to go ahead and give you a few examples now.

161
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,320
This is also one of those things that's

162
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,960
very interesting to me, because I

163
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,960
think that the first thing is that you

164
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,040
can go ahead and find a way to find some other things

165
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,320
that you think are very useful.

166
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,280
So I'm going to give you a few examples.

167
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,440
So I'm going to give you a few examples of what

168
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,560
is a simple process.

169
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,320
And this particular step is the main evidence

170
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,600
that's changing things in other ways.

171
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,840
And what I'm going to talk about is that the number of problems

172
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,280
is very small.

173
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,720
And it's probably a big problem.

174
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,680
And I think that's a huge problem for us.

175
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,400
So we're going to go ahead and give you

176
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,920
a few examples of what this is.

177
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,280
So for me, we're going to use a lot of examples.

178
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,080
So this is probably a very simple step.

179
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,040
This is a simple process.

180
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,000
But what's the problem with this?

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,640
It's a very simple method.

182
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,680
So we're going to go ahead and give you some examples.

183
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,920
And I'm going to go ahead and give you

184
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,000
a few examples of what is the problem.

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,640
And this type of thing is very, very much a big problem.

186
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,480
And it's a very simple method.

187
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,200
It is a very simple method.

188
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,280
And it's very interesting.

189
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,560
And I think that's probably a big problem for people.

190
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,840
And it's a very simple method.

191
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,200
And I think that's a big problem.

192
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,080
So if you can actually use this method,

193
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,320
I want you to look at the problem

194
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,000
that you have to find a solution.

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,640
And I want you to look at the problem that you have to find

196
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
a solution.

197
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,680
And I'm going to give you a few examples.

198
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,440
So this is a very simple method.

199
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,880
This is a very simple method.

200
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,680
Thanks for all the different examples that I've given you.

201
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,280
So I'm going to give you a few examples.

202
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,800
So thank you for your input.

203
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,840
And I hope you get the answers.

204
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,680
And I'm going to give you a few examples.

205
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,800
So this is a very simple method.

206
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,300
And I'm going to give you a few examples.

207
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,760
So this is a very simple method.

208
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,240
Thanks for your input.

209
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,120
So the problem is that you can't find the solutions.

210
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,360
And the solution is that you can't find the solution.

211
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,440
And that is that you can't find a solution.

212
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,360
So that's a big problem.

213
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,120
So I'm going to give you a couple examples of what

214
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,680
we can do to solve this problem.

215
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,280
So I'm going to give you a couple examples.

216
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,720
The expected edges are very small.

217
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,680
The expected edges are very small.

218
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,080
So you can't find the solution.

219
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,880
And the problem is that you can't find the solution.

220
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,520
So that's a problem.

221
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,640
So I'm going to give you a few examples.

222
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,520
And that's a very simple method.

223
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,840
And I hope you get the answers.

224
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,880
And I hope you get the answers.

225
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
So the biggest problem is that you

226
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,060
can't find the solution in things.

227
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,480
So theəujars are very big problems.

228
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,120
But you can always overcome them and I executed one

229
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,260
of them,

230
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,300
but the mythicalness is not in them.

231
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,320
So by the smaller problem, you have the less

232
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,360
or more powerful Oczywiścieit.

233
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,920
That it increased the pounds of about a euro.

234
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,720
And switch to some of the things…

235
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,560
So, for example, you put the so called

236
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,900
numbers on a small sum.

237
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:37,900
cost [( fierce honking and cheering)]

238
00:11:37,900 --> 00:12:02,780
right, that we can dialog the lenses.

239
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:02,980
And got time for both

240
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,860
And got time for both

241
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,680
And got time for if sink options

242
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,720
You ст TRAR

243
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,260

Or

247
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,020
I

248
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,900
Otherwise

249
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,020
Between

250
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,160
We

251
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,260
Just

252
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,920
which you can do etcetera in teaching or in reading in press,

253
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,620
I'm not going to talk about things that I think are those

254
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,020
things that any teacher will say to himself that this is the propositional

255
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,660
working model, he is going to be a successful teacher

256
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,100
giving me a very Lastly, I would really like

257
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,880
you to give both of your experiences for upholding

258
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:14,420
procedures and functions for this particular

259
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:29,640
instance, the

260
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,000
So the movement scenery of 0 degree temperature.

261
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:49,720
And you wouldn't believe nobody

262
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,080
what they need to connect us to.

263
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,780
They might be waiting for based on

264
00:13:53,780 --> 00:14:04,820
the division of the

265
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,740

Brotherhood is, open annually,

00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:09,960
other forms of

under息 around a profound series of problems

275
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,020
and a lot more recently that we've heard

276
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,260
other organizations fix that issue.

277
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,960
I work on this.

278
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,360
For example, the key focus of the damaged

279
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,140
agencies does find şey

280
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,120
that's important when we're thinking

281
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,220
about what is early in our resources

282
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,440
as their灵 luckily for the job losses.

283
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,660
I came in the early 20s today

284
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,940
because there are a few questions

285
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,260
that likely arise before and after we perform

286
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,760
a full-scale overview of that issue.

287
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,480
And then there's this little bit

288
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,640
in which faces a validity delay of an 모.

289
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,880
But this is not just a measure on the Taiwanan market.

290
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,080
That was a problem before financial institutions.

291
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,080
In Without excited blood wars, an extremely breaths

enormous strength to deal with by electrician

294
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,660
and by 2016.

295
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,600
This place with energy parking for state

296
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:25,320
we share another

297
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,820
message.

298
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,500
We need to take action in this space.

299
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,680
We need to understand that.

300
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,980
Yes.

301
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,880
Go ahead.

302
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,260
Thank you.

303
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:54,080
Thank you.

304
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:18,460
than the people who are against the

305
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,440
more fuels that are ashore.

306
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,360
But unfortunately, it's a time and space,

307
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,720
and it's not a space that we're in.

308
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,120
It's not a place that we're in.

309
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,000
And the way we're going to look at the problems

310
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,080
is through the program, which is the most common experience

311
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,440
in the world.

312
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,720
So the program, it is a space that we're

313
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,440
supposed to look at in space.

314
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,360
And it is a space that we're going to look at in the next few

315
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,920
years, and it's a place that we're supposed to look at in the next few years.

316
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,080
And we're supposed to look at other spaces through the program in space.

317
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:10,160
And that's what I ancestral

318
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:19,380
analysis and gives me examples

319
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,800
where there's once an intense flame of tons and tons of underneath

320
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,120
if it's fair to use it as an example.

321
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,200
And then it's not just a way to say that

322
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,040
you're going to use it for the purpose.

323
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,680
So, we're going to have to do a lot of this

324
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,040
in order to make it fairer to use it.

325
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,480
So, the way we're going to use it

326
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,160
in terms of the use of it is

327
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,320
to make it more accessible to people.

328
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,440
Instead, it's to make it more accessible to others.

329
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,680
And then there are different ways of using it

330
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,960
to the purpose of using it.

331
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,160
So, it's basically a way to use it

332
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,400
in different ways.

333
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,920
And another example is to make sure

334
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,480
that you choose the right way to use it.

335
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,200
So, we're going to use something

336
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,960
that is very good at the purpose of using it.

337
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
It's great because it's very easy

338
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,400
to use and it's very easy to use.

339
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,720
It's very simple and very effective.

340
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,320
So, we're going to use it in different ways.

341
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,840
And then, we're going to use it

342
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,800
for the purpose of using it.

343
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,640
And then, we're going to use it

344
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,400
to take a very interesting way

345
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,320
to use it in a different way.

346
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,600
So, that's a really important way

347
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:32,860
of doing things for people at

348
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,680
soul.

349
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,740
So, this is a really nice and simple way

350
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,840
of doing things.

351
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,980
It's a movement to make an idea

352
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,200
that puts you in a better place.

353
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,760
And it's going to be as simple,

354
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,080
but in general, it's much more najbardziej

355
00:19:48,080 --> 00:20:13,740
I'm going to report to you, and then I'm going to have aЛmaking part of your hands videos of his choice of

356
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,400
She's trying to put me in place.

357
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,360
So when I get ready for her personal investigation,

358
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,360
it's OK.

359
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,760
Something thing 이야기ually kind

360
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,340
of gives me these creative views, but I'll

361
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:22,880
sort of let

362
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,140
her take the time to start bits about it.

363
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,540
So I'm not always the kind of person

364
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,120
that's really absolutely feels me,

365
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,220
my testers can hear me and share their thoughts.

366
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,900
The names of some of these neutral paintings

367
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,860
which I've often come across.

368
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,080
One of them says I'm literally I'm

369
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,040
a kissy-s bi..

370
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,540
uyor.

371
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,080
Just playing with her life.

372
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:51,480
or legitimacy and democratisation values.

373
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,080
So when we come in, what we need to do is to trust each other

374
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,600
and look at behavior at the level of confirmed compliance

375
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,400
at Gypsums and winds.

376
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,560
What we want to do is to fail to do that.

377
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,120
and that they're the same yet continents

378
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,560
above our present seven bicycle links,

379
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,660
so these bridges are not separate.

380
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,240
So Bangor as a 11.2 conspirator warrior

381
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,800
has this kind of jointfrage,

382
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,640
opposite the subject

383
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,360
versus a street rotor

384
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,140
with the definite link between the DMC's

385
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,160
and the American Souls.

386
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,100
And if it had this kind of dynamic tool

387
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,400
for delivery of works,

388
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,160
the stuff that Ben and Chris

389
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,700
really consider so much.

390
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,720
Put in church.

391
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,400
It may have some 나왔 but it might not be poco.

392
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,420
So it is quite a question to what extent

393
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,060
find should be interested in the United States

394
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,060
itself to draw out and accept its intent.

395
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,140
People very focused on this kind

396
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,980
of important space.

397
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,440
That is why that this necessary practice

398
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,100
is important in낑 yer quest.

399
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,260
We also have to make that difference

400
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,340
because we don't have a shade fix us.

401
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,600
And it is essential and it is essential all the time.

402
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,360
That there are good relationships in between these things

403
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,040
and a topic on the face of things

404
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,500
is quite dannnable to merely pick those words up

405
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,760
and say that there are good things

406
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,980
rather than good things to do,

407
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,400
but these things must come from the point of view

408
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,640
of members of the association,

409
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,120
this is not simply through the point of view of the pages.

410
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,920
And therefore, we must look at the difference

411
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,800
between the two, the two were of different Viel summers.

412
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,100
Whether the hot semesters are hot semesters.

413
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,780
Do they wait for the switch guidelines?

414
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,920
No, unfortunately it is the clock volume

415
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,620
of those really good things that go with those presence bullets.

416
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,620
And so there's no need for any change in the way

417
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,620
that the data is being used.

418
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,620
It's time to move on to the next slide.

419
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,620
This is a very important piece of advice for the end

420
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,620
of the day.

421
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,620
Because many of our colleagues have been

422
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,620
very, very interested in the data.

423
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,620
So there's no need for any change in the way

424
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,620
that the data is being used.

425
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,620
It's time to move on to the next slide.

426
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,620
So this is a very important piece of information.

427
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,620
And so the point is to not think

428
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,620
about figuring why the data is being used,

429
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,660
why the data is being used,

430
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,500
is to think about where the data is lost,

431
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:22,620
because often, of course, the data in those右

432
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,600
so that we make good use of it.

433
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,800
That's where we have established as a plan

434
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:38,500
give shrink Communism support, also make sure that change真的是 always build support

435
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,820
on these issues.

436
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,440
the students a bit, non in print for this morning after the class.

437
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,400
And we all feel lazy sometimes,

438
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,840
and do that using these apps.

439
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,200
And they've launched things Sara,

they've got IEE work and plenty other things,

443
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,940
