1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
All right.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Everything looks good. Thank you so much.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And I really trust that you all had a great day yesterday.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We are now day four of PyCon US 2023.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today and tomorrow we have more talks followed by the sprints.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So today's keynote is James Powell,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
who is someone who I really can't wait to introduce to you.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And but coming up soon we will have first the special guest,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
steering council is coming up right away after these messages.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And followed by the steering council,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
we have the diversity and inclusion panel today, soon.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And okay.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Thank you for giving the lightning talks today.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And yesterday is really great. I really learned a lot.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And you can still sign up for lightning talks,

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and the sign-ups are at the poster board next to the registration desk.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Expo hall is still there, and this is the final day for all the booths,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
the sponsors and the community booth startup rows.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Tomorrow that whole room will look totally different for the job fair and posters.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So if you haven't got your swag from sponsors, go there today.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And get your T-shirts.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If you order T-shirts when you register for PyCon,

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I saw there are still lots of T-shirts there.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
If anything that is unclaimed will be for sale tomorrow at 11.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And really I admit that I also missed out on buying T-shirts,

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
so I was bummed.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes, but tomorrow line up at the swag desk to buy the unclaimed T-shirts.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's really cool. I love the golden color there.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
PyLadies Auction is happening tonight at 6.30, room 151 DEFG.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And there is literally a one-of-a-kind item up for auction.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A vinyl record with performances by Python community members

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
titled The Zen Side of the Moon,

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
featuring musical talents from Python community members like Lynne Root and Thea Flowers.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
There is really only one record in existence and you should go to auction and bid on it.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
One thing I forgot to mention and I regret this.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
There is PyCon active. It's back in room 250.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
There is one more session today at 6.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And basically we have yoga sessions.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The mats will be provided and there's nothing, all levels are welcome.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
There are even people, if you notice in the photo, people were doing yoga in jeans.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So no preparation needed. If you need, if you are interested, just go there.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And I want to thank you all for continuing to follow our health and safety guidelines.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And during lightning talk this morning,

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Quang shared a DIY ear saver technology while wearing a mask.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I think it's advanced technology.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So if you missed out that lightning talk, go talk to Quang in PyCon APAC booth.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And I'm really grateful for you all to continue to do this.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
For every person who complains about the policy,

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
we get like 10 others who are so grateful that you are doing this.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We may be the one who set up the rules,

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
but it's really you all who are doing this, helping us by masking up.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So thank you for being considerate for those who are vulnerable

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
and wouldn't come here really otherwise if we had decided to lift the mask policy.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So thank you so much.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And as a reminder, here's how you report COC incidents.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And it's really impossible for us to be everywhere in the venue.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a large venue. We can't be everywhere all at once.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So please do continue to send us reports for mask violations.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And thank you for folks who have been volunteering, but we actually still need more.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I was at the speaker room yesterday.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We're supposed to have session runners who will take the speakers to their room.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We didn't have enough.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Like I had to tell speakers to please go to your room.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If any of the speakers there had to go alone, I'm really sorry.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But you can still sign up to help out,

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and you would just go to the PyCon US dashboard to volunteer.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And speaking of volunteering, my challenge for you is still on.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And you can report your score to me by you can mention me, you can even DM me,

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
which is the scariest thing you can tell people.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Tell me about it or use the PyCon US challenge hashtag.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I'm really actually I'm happy to see folks participating in this challenge.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I saw people open pull requests.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I saw some type of fixes to the PEPs repo.

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And a great job.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And I want to give a shout out to Amethyst.

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
She managed to actually propose a new PEP, PEP 713.

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's a huge accomplishment, her first ever PEP.

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And PEP 713 is still, I think, it's still being reviewed by the PEP editors

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and is being sponsored by core developer, Lukas Langa.

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
PEP 73, callable module.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's awesome.

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Lots of respect to you, Amethyst.

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And for the rest of you, be like Amethyst.

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Take on these challenges.

87
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
All right.

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Thank you.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay, sorry.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We actually before the steering council,

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
we have a brief message from one of our visionary sponsors, Google.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So thank you.

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Hi, I'm Nina Zakarenko, and it's great to be here at my 11th PyCon.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Thanks.

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
If this is your first PyCon, I wanted to extend an extra special welcome.

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We're glad you're here.

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'd like to share a message from Google, one of PyCon 2023's visionary sponsors.

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You may already be familiar with some of the some of Google's initiatives around Python,

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
our ongoing financial sponsorship of the PSF as a visionary sponsor,

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
donations of Google Cloud infrastructure to the PSF,

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
as well as funding of Python's developer and residence program.

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But something I'm really excited to share a little bit more about is the team that I work on,

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Google's open source security team.

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let's take a quick survey of the room.

105
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If this applies to you, please raise your hand.

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You use open source software, including Python.

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay.

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You contribute to an open source project.

109
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You're all awesome.

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Lastly, if you're a core maintainer of an open source project.

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay.

112
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Given how ubiquitous open source is, there's an imbalance between use of open source

113
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and contribution to open source, both time and financial sponsorship.

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That dynamic has many consequences, one being that it creates a security gap

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
that bad actors can take advantage of.

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Our team at Google recognizes this, and over the past few years,

117
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
we've been creating tooling and contributing time resources as well

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
to open source communities to enable them to be more secure.

119
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Our team has collaborated on the creation of several significant supply chain security projects

120
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and their ongoing development, including Salsa, Sig Store, Scorecard,

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
along with the Linux Foundation and the OpenSSF and other partners.

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Our team sponsors an open source fuzzing initiative called OSSFuzz

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
that enables automated scanning for bugs in software.

124
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We run the service for free for critical open source projects.

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
We have a reward program, and at this time, we have almost 30,000 verified bug fixes.

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We don't just release tools.

127
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We also contribute developer time, both to interested projects to help them tackle

128
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
low-hanging fruit and configure their builds to be more secure,

129
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
but also to the Linux kernel, improving areas of memory safety

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
to help prevent entire classes of vulnerabilities.

131
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
On top of developer time, we also contribute funds and sponsorship.

132
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We contributed towards the fund that sponsored the PSF's new security developer and residence.

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We run the sos.dev rewards program along with the Linux Foundation

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
to fund security improvements in critical open source projects,

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and in the past, we've also sponsored some larger initiatives,

136
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
such as vendor work on integrating Rust into the Linux kernel,

137
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
critical security improvements to PyPI, and contributing to OpenSSF's Alpha Omega funds.

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We continue to explore options to give back.

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
While there's still a lot of work to be done, I'd like to say that I'm proud of the work

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
that Google's open source security team has been doing to advance security in open source

141
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
while being a partner to communities and to maintainers,

142
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and of Google's continued support, both of the PSF, of PyCon,

143
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and lastly, of the Python community.

144
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Thank you all, and I hope you have a wonderful PyCon.

145
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Thank you.

146
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
All right. Thank you again, Google, for being our visionary sponsor.

147
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And right now, we will have the Python Steering Council who will take stage,

148
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and the Python Steering Council is five people elected by the Python core developers

149
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
who basically, the Steering Council is the governance model that replaces the BDFL model

150
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
that was held by Guido van Rassum for many, many years.

151
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So, welcome. Welcome, Ansit.

152
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
All right.

153
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Well, good morning. Good morning, everybody.

154
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Welcome back to another wonderful day at PyCon.

155
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
My name is Brett Cannon, and I get to have the honor to represent the five of us up here

156
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and give you kind of a quick rundown of who we are, what we do,

157
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and some highlights of what's coming in 3.12, which means all of you are about to get a point,

158
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
so congratulations.

159
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So, first key question. What is the Steering Council?

160
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Hopefully, this will answer the question of the person who asked me this the other day on the elevator.

161
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
If you want technical details, you can go read PEP 13,

162
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
which defines exactly the role of the Steering Council and how elections work and such.

163
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You can also watch the presentation last year where Pablo and Thomas talked all about this,

164
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and I think we're able to go into a bit more detail.

165
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But basically, the Steering Council is the group on the Python core team

166
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
that make final decisions when necessary.

167
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We try to make decisions based on consensus, but sometimes, obviously, that's not necessarily obvious.

168
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And so, in those instances, the five of us have a deliberation, talk about things over,

169
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and just have to make a final call.

170
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Typically, this is mostly around PEPs, so, and this is PEP,

171
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
PEP will be one that will come to us eventually, and we'll have a discussion,

172
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and then as a group, potentially make a decision if the core devs themselves

173
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
don't come forward and say, as a more unified body, we want this or we don't.

174
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We also have to sometimes help make technical decisions when core devs kind of seem split on one way to go or another.

175
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
We also sometimes, unfortunately, have to deal with COVID conduct issues.

176
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But in general, anything involving the core team where some final decision needs to be made,

177
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
it eventually works its way up to us, and we have to make that call.

178
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
In terms of who can be on the Steering Council, it's actually open technically to anyone

179
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
as long as they are nominated by a core developer.

180
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Core developers are allowed to nominate themselves.

181
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Voting is done by a fellow core developers.

182
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
If you're at all into voting systems, you can read PEP 13 for details on how all that works.

183
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Now, in terms of who we are personally, there are five of us.

184
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Emily Morehouse of CuddleSoft.

185
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This is our first year on the council.

186
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We have Greggy Smith from Google, who's here for his second year.

187
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We have Pablo Galindo-Salgado from Bloomberg on his third year.

188
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We have Thomas Wutters from Google on his fourth year.

189
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And my name is Brett Cannon from Microsoft.

190
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This is my fifth and final year on the Steering Council.

191
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So amazingly enough, we have a one, two, three, four, five terms of seniority.

192
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't know how that worked out, but it's convenient at least for this talk.

193
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, and by the way, if you really care, PEP 8104 covers the actual election itself.

194
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So you can see who else ran, voting count, all that stuff.

195
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So this is when all of you get that point for what's coming up in 3.12.

196
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
If you want to see what's already landed technically in the main branch,

197
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
you can go to the What's New page for the 3.12 docs.

198
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Now, to be very clear, when you go to docs.python.org, it's going to be defaulted to 3.11.

199
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So if you want the 3.12 docs, make sure to hit that toggle in the upper left,

200
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and then select 3.12, and then you'll be able to see the What's New.

201
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But I will say these are just highlights. It is not exhaustive at all.

202
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And some things are not necessarily on here because they haven't landed yet.

203
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But to give you that point, here are some highlights.

204
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So to start off, we're getting better F-strings.

205
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So unfortunately, we forgot to capitalize out for that extra point.

206
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But basically what this means is actually Pablo and fellow team members

207
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
put in a lot of work to actually add F-strings to the parser.

208
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So F-strings are going to get faster because the parser will deal with this upfront.

209
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You can now nest quotation marks.

210
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So any of you who have all gone, ah, I've got to use single quotes and then double quotes

211
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and single quotes and kind of make that all work, that's been taken care of.

212
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And all the nesting down below gets taken care of as well.

213
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah, it's one of those small little things that just really makes things a lot nicer.

214
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So, obviously awesome.

215
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If you attended Eric Snow's talk yesterday, you already know about the optional

216
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
per subinterpreter gill work. That has not landed yet.

217
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Eric is now under pressure to get that done.

218
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But basically what this does is we have a feature called subinterpreters,

219
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
currently only available via the C API.

220
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But what Eric's work does is it makes each individual interpreter in that process

221
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
have its own gill.

222
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So watch Eric's talk if you want to get some juicy numbers of how that could potentially

223
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
actually get you some performance boost.

224
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
We are actually, as a steering council though, looking for the community to try this out.

225
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Try out APIs, kind of design stuff and kind of get feedback within the community

226
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
of how this should maybe get exposed to Python at the Python level.

227
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So please give it a try.

228
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We have improved syntax for specifying type parameters, i.e. if you are all into generics

229
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
when you're doing your typing, you're going to be very happy.

230
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
This is another feature that hasn't quite landed yet, but we accepted the PEP.

231
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It will make defining generic code using typing way, way easier.

232
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So all of you tired of writing out type alias, you're going to like this.

233
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
All right.

234
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So the next round of applause will be for Pablo, because we're getting even more

235
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
improved error messages.

236
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah, go ahead.

237
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
We know you all love it.

238
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
There's multiple.

239
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm not even going to try to go through them all, but you're getting more of those.

240
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
We are removing just utils just to give everyone a heads up.

241
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
All right, yeah.

242
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Makes my life easy.

243
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
There's less code now.

244
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah, we've been playing this for a while.

245
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
We're just kind of moving all the packed new stuff out into the packed new community

246
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
to let them handle it, because let's be honest, it's kind of just been sitting there

247
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
because we've been too scared to change it to break people.

248
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So that's moving out.

249
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
A bunch of old unit tests methods are finally going away.

250
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Hopefully you've all been paying attention to the deprecation warnings.

251
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
If not, you're in for a surprise.

252
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And another thing is invalid escape sequences are now a syntax warning.

253
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So if you've accidentally done slash, I don't know, s, s not valid, you'll get a warning

254
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
about that actually at the syntactic level just to let you know, like, you probably meant

255
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
to add an extra slash to escape that thing, or you typed the wrong letter.

256
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
As I said, there's some other things coming.

257
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
We've actually preliminary approved PEP 649, which is all about type hints and making those

258
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
lazy.

259
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There was a last minute update.

260
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
We haven't officially accepted the new update, so we hope that's coming, but there's still

261
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
some things in the pipeline.

262
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But there's a deadline.

263
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So beta one is due as of May 8th.

264
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Thomas is our release manager, so he gets the unenviable job of cutting everyone off.

265
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And also thank you to Pablo for being our release manager for the previous two releases

266
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
of 3.10 and 3.11.

267
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And Wukash is here, and he just retired thanks to 3.9 being done.

268
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Anyway, the key thing is all features have to get in for beta one, which is going to

269
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
be May 8th, so two and a half weeks, roughly.

270
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Whatever Thomas says.

271
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And so the deal is all the features have to get in.

272
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Once we hit beta, we then ask all of you in the community, and so I'm now personally asking

273
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
every single one of you who maintain Python code, please, please, please, please, please,

274
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
please, please, please test the betas.

275
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
We need this feedback because we need to know if we're breaking people in some horrible

276
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
way that we weren't expecting getting feedback on the features because once we reach that

277
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
release candidate in end of July, we're feature frozen.

278
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So we can't take anything back anymore.

279
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So I'm once again going to beg all of you, please test the betas.

280
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Please.

281
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And especially if you're on PyPI, if you can create beta wheels, really, really, really

282
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
appreciate it.

283
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So please do.

284
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And obviously the final release will hopefully be in October as is our normal schedule, the

285
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
anniversary of Monty Python's flying circus.

286
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
If you have any questions, feel free to walk up to any of us at the conference.

287
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You can also email us at steering-cancel at python.org.

288
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
There's actually also a GitHub repo at GitHub.com slash python slash steering-cancel where you

289
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
can also open an issue if necessary to reach us and ask us a question.

290
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Those are all our personal email addresses if you need to reach one of us directly.

291
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
As I said, though, I will be leaving at the end of this year, so you have a limited amount

292
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
of time to bug me about this stuff, but the rest of these folks might still be on, so

293
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
who knows?

294
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
We will be holding elections in November, historically, so you'll potentially see these

295
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
same faces again.

296
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You'll only see one new face next year.

297
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And I believe that's it.

298
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So thank you very much, everyone, and enjoy the conference.
