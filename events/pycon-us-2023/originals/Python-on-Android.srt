1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yes, in every area of the public lecture,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and to add to that, and to add to that,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and to add to that, and to add to that,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
we have this very nice cycle of

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
interviewing these students,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
particularly this week,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and I'm especially happy to be here today

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to present to you my

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Changes to Selective C

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
in this presentation.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But I'm not going to be

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the only one who will be able to

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
look at the platform.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's right, everyone is different

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and I'm going to be in this different classroom

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
that many of you have been to.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's the biggest

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
networking system in the world.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's 41% of the public

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and community access to

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
the market here.

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Right now, the next

23
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
number of people in the industry

24
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
is about 20% and 20% of the public.

25
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So that's a huge number of people

26
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
who will speak with those

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
one-way servers,

28
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
support glitches,

29
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
take advantage of the support

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
platform that we have in the public.

31
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So you'll see that later in the school

32
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and after the lecture,

33
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and I think we'll be done with the

34
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
whole class from this day

35
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
starting this conference today.

36
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now before we get into the

37
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
general, I want to say a few words.

38
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Thank you.

39
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So I want to talk a little bit

40
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
about the different things that we do

41
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
in the school.

42
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
One of them is that it's not a special

43
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
school.

44
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And the other one is that it's not

45
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
a really big, open school

46
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
that we're going to be coming to.

47
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We're going to be doing a lot of

48
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
different things.

49
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We're going to be doing

50
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
a lot of different things.

51
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We're going to be doing some

52
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
different things.

53
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
One of the things,

54
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't know what Bohs said,

55
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I think he should think that

56
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,040
is a prejudice if it's just

57
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,340
because we're huge,

58
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,340
we're huge numbers of people.

59
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm not sure if that untuk

60
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,040
zorong answer this.

61
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So to work for the platform,

62
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
for the schools that're

63
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
about to be workshops of otherwise

64
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
large blocks of storage that

65
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
you have in school is

66
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,260
looking for the arranged

67
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
silverware community

68
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
jobs model that is right

69
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
behind you,

70
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
is in the �cl Partners� framework.

71
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,640
More ain't as

72
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
much has been done

73
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
among people,

74
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:25,000

76
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,120
By the phrase,

77
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,120
what you need is

78
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,840
support and support.

79
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,420
By that and by the word

80
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,520
what it's termed as

81
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,980
support and support.

82
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,860
We've СтRAJD and they have a superkaunut, about 100% oflines, just a

83
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,940
잠깐만, bit about 5 seconds.

84
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,860
So everything actually needs to be taiatique before we talk about

85
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,940
that, right?

86
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,140
The next slide, if you haven't seen our slides yet, these are

87
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,700
my slides.

88
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,660
The back pages are about the IR transformer.

89
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,660
We don't have fulfillment.

90
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:17,740
We don't have the

91
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:36,980
the

92
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:47,600
to

93
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,800
and I think that we have to be thankful for that.

94
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,720
And very soon, we'll be talking about it.

95
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,920
So if you're interested, it's going to be

96
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,640
quite an exciting time.

97
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,760
And I'll just have a couple of things

98
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,240
before we start to talk about it.

99
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,300
And I'm going to talk about the

100
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,140
things that we've been talking about.

101
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,440
I'm not going to go into detail,

102
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,640
but I'm going to give you some tips

103
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,360
to go over this thing.

104
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,560
I'll just give you some tips

105
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,680
that you can do to trust us.

106
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,440
I'll just give you some tips.

107
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,080
So, I'm going to talk about it.

108
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,880
I'm going to explain a couple of things

109
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,860
that allow us to teach as a group.

110
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,940
And a couple of things that arouse

111
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,260
the increased growingboy energy

112
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,800
and reason, I'm going to explain in just a few words,

113
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,280
and what many of you just know from this talk.

114
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,120
And the fact that we can do it

115
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,020
in as many different ways as possible

116
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,760
is a key and it's about low- 가능ities

117
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,860
to accept the elements that can be

118
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,020
at the end of this thing.

119
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,800
I just want twenty minutes

And what exactly?

126
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,320
Because I feel that if you want to pl syrup to,

127
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,600
what is the problem?

128
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,720
All I should be is I want to ....

129
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,680

why do you actually provide free CPU

131
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,400
why do you actually provide free

why do you choose

136
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:06,580
Why do you choose

its

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,200
have obtained a

161
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,960
degree in the course of science and

162
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,640
engineering.

163
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,640
The

164
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:17,420
research showed that the

165
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,640
process of

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,120

169
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,580
had quite a little bit of consensus

170
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,880
in terms of the

171
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,880
spe 명ilistion of these.

172
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,200
Unfortunately not much Canada

173
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,440

Besides it

177
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,540
is reflected

178
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,780
and it is experientially important

179
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,360
to haveget the value the

180
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,800
other way around,

181
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,160

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,220
to move in UEF

183

quite part of aufger

And about that is

191
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,760
important for the

192
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,760
So, the idea of this is that we can actually

193
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,760
use the data that we have in the database.

194
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,760
So, in this case, we can actually

195
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
take the data from the resource.

196
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
So, we can actually take the data from the resource

197
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
and use it as a resource for our system.

198
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,760
And then we can actually use it

199
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,760
to do a lot of things.

200
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
So, it's not just the information

201
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
that we can use to do that.

202
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
And in fact, the data that we can use

203
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
for our system, like for example,

204
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,760
for our teams, we can actually do that

205
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
in the database.

206
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,760
The way that we do that is

207
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
we can basically use the data

208
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
that we have, like the data that we have

209
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
in the database as a resource

210
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,760
for our system and the database.

211
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
And we can actually use it in our database

212
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
for our system to do a lot of things.

213
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
And that's why we have a lot of tools

214
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,760
that we can use to do that.

215
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
So, that's it.

216
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
And I think that's a great way to

217
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
use the data that we have in the database

218
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,760
to do a lot of things.

219
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,760
So, we can actually use the data

220
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
That's blue.

221
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,300
And everything you see is a little bit different about the

222
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,320
old one here.

223
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,760
But anyway, that's the limited truth that I got about emitters

224
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
here, and항 it may have the nose.

225
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Something I just tried to think about.

226
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,500
And what it basically is.

227
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,420
And so, maybe just to clarify.

228
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,900
I guess the naturalist one is an engineer who just had

229
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,000
specializations in reality.

230
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,620
And then there are definitions for authors.

231
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,000
For instance, that ن arribat y・et ni nn br okay so she has

232
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,660
thelekpatsножis, that well, if I have to answer both these

233
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,060
which are the things that make this component

234
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,860
specifically one component.

235
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,500
So we're going to start by introducing

236
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,660
some of the things that make this component

237
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,660
just a function of the component.

238
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,780
So these are things you can, as I said,

239
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,140
look at the other components.

240
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,060
And these are stuff that we're going to do.

241
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,180
And then I just want to look at some of the things

242
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,860
that you can do with something that you can do

243
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,660
with a component.

244
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,460
But I'm going to especially go to the component.

245
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,020
And what we just have to look for,

246
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,300
listen on to the respondent Miyan and, by the way,

247
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,280
the method of public input,

248
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,440
extrapolating to one component on another component.

249
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,740
And we'll look at the system reverse Around 1 offensive

250
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,280
from the matrix itself.

251
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,740
This is just something that we can see the point.

252
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,460
Now there are many things that we can do,

253
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,380
but we're also going to focus on the regular order

254
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,880
we have planned for the excel index.

255
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,400
First of all, we have an advantage many times.

256
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,740
That is, we're awar, and all of a sudden there's

257
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,260
we're on to the Lightning.

258
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,700
things situation in Doors'Mary."

259
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,760
Remove various hiddenwar andere inferences

260
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,080
of the same strings.

261
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,140
If you use the same strings,

262
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,240
use the sums to the region you've tugged on.

263
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,000
So that gives us a little bit of context.

264
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,320
In other words, tie circuits context in registro,

265
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,940
Shi jewelry in registro.

266
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,420
That puts me in the centre.

267
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,940
And that mutates literally across a combination

268
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,780
of two Sweepdam不是

269
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,120
because all reverberations are the same, in both.

270
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:39,620
the

271
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,420
that there's not much evidence of that.

272
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,140
So I want to answer your question.

273
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,100
I think that's something that you can answer.

274
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,020
And I think that's something that you can answer.

275
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,340
But I think that's something that you can answer.

276
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,860
If you were interested in learning

277
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,780
how to get a good grade in math, then you

278
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,500
are up to something for that.

279
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,660
So there's a lot of things that you can do.

280
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,500
But the most important one is to have a good grade.

281
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,100
Also, in practice, for example, if you're

282
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,820
first considering writing a thesis,

283
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:13,860
come up with a illustration for your journey down to university,

284
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,700
as a result you will die, which is when you die.

285
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
Then you come back to work, and you're

286
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,260
actually ready to go to college.

287
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,720
So let's do this.

288
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,220
And I'm, I love this idea of technology that

289
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,300
allows you to go to school.

290
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,060
in 30 years lived here sen.

291
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,980
Moreover, after the White House

292
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,560
and 8 years as it made West

293
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,800
India, the U.S.

294
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,420
The place was combination of

295
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,900
Practice Sheet Garden physician

296
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,240

spirit打興

298
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,560
a

299
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,600
set of

300
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:57,840
house

301
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:23,720
还有,对于法人的加入,他在这个角度上是非常有 så discovering that he has designated the

302
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,220
and we're going to have to do it in a very short time.

303
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,620
So there's nothing that I feel really useful.

304
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,860
But I think that the important thing

305
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,100
that I'm going to say is that one of the things

306
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,140
that's important to me is that I'm

307
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,340
going to be able to do this work.

308
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,740
So I'm going to talk a little bit about the reason.

309
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,260
And I think that's one of the reasons

310
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,820
that I'm going to be able to do this work.

311
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,060
And I think that's something that I'm

312
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,220
going to be able to do at this time,

313
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,660
is to be able to do this work.

314
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,320
Just so I can get something into the center

315
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,560
of my written work there.

316
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,000
And I think everyone else installed

317
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,240
some really useful things too,

318
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,920
along the signs and parameters.

319
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,400
ninguém lighting, friendly stuff,

320
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,280
hoping we're going to find something that

321
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,040
I can fill in the room, that they need to approve.

322
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:20,740
But instead of dried ramen, that they're

323
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:20,760
But I can fill in the room, that they're

324
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:20,780
going to cover and publish it on the sea.

325
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,020
and publish it on the sea.

326
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,180
got it shredded just like that and we're not gonna want

327
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,680
to go to another kingdom.

328
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,520
Just one.

329
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,100
I've had a few ideas and there were some ideas

330
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,300
and they're all like yeah,

331
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,020
you can start packing stuff or you can justFor challenges

332
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,060
like that.

333
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,700
Can I just go in and try changing the dyslexia?

334
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,140
I didn't because it's a very IPL'd type of idea

335
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,760
that can be super important for signing.

336
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,700
So I kind of think that's just a bone ivory

337
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,540
for a clue.

338
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,720
balanced effort that we bring in these days,

339
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,560
to make sure we fix them.

340
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,880
thinner overall, tenía some background

341
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,240
from the previous report in the press,

342
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,240
has shown is there any select bell for me

343
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,740
exactly we haven't thought priority

344
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,280
to energy that was trimmed for a channel.

345
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,440
One last item, was the

346
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,940
built for itself we also call CHRISP.

347
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,780
And sometimes there's very little people

348
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,580
that actually go very bare.

349
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,620
And I think their way to clockwork is to give how

350
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,720
they're doing their work.

351
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,220
There are some, for example, engineers

352
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,940
that spend a lot of hours working on having

353
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,360
their private units of them.

354
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,280
So it's easier for fixators, which

355
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,200
can be fairly puntual, for people

356
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,040
like that, do set-am roll.

357
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,140
And I just want to mention that the fixator and our fa México

358
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,000
정estä, for example, would usually

359
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,500
the argument immediately.

360
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,760
someone will be Raz it at that time.

a component of fraudulent language bilding.

367
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,360
But I said, if you couldn't get in the information

368
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,380
pense you were wondering where advertisements.

369
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:14,660
Or the LAN speed had come up when

370
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,680
I got here.

371
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,200
I couldn't figure anything that doesstth coefficients

372
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,660
out of that thing.

373
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:26,340
and it's a critical resource for the development of this work.

374
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,540
That's why you saw the back-end.

375
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,900
It's a small engine, it's a car.

376
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,420
That's why it's a very small engine.

377
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,020
And it's a car that's not so big or that it's small.

378
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,660
It's a car that's not so big or that it's small.

379
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,740
And then you look at the other pieces,

380
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,140
causes of the engine, it's a car that's not so big or that it's small.

381
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,100
And it's a car that's very small, but it's very powerful.

382
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,580
And then you look at the other pieces,

383
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:54,100
causes of the engine, it's a car that's not so big or that it's small.

384
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,260
One thing to be sure of is that the level of efficiency of the car itself

385
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,820
that is expected in this project is not so big.

386
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,060
Because of the fact that it's a big engine,

387
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,620
it's a very small engine, and it's not so big.

388
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,700
It's a very small engine.

389
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,340
And that's why we're going to have to do a lot of study and research

390
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,140
to ensure that we're using the engine for this.

391
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,220
And what's on the map, the engine is not so big,

392
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,060
and that's a very small engine.

393
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,060
And that's why we're going to have to do a lot of study and research.

394
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,780
So the big thing is, you know,

395
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,900
we're still in the middle of the process of the construction of the car.

396
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,420
But the way it's looking, the car is doing it.

397
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,740
The car is doing it.

398
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,860
And the big thing is that the engine is still in the process of being built.

399
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,260
And it's still in the process of being built.

400
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,380
So it's very interesting.

401
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,980
It has a very thin line.

402
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,100
There we go.

403
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,380
And it has four long lines.

404
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,300
It's very thin.

405
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,300
I can see this.

406
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,820
I've got to try and make it.

407
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,940
Can you see that?

408
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,780
How many railings are there inside the engine for the vehicle?

409
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,700
So this is a 10 gallon truck that's located on top of coronna coal say this.

410
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:23,920
it, and then after you do that moving on, after the

411
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:30,920
Miiblings, you get some också as well of course

412
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:41,360
involved before you veure

413
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,800
so, and we talked about family locations where people

414
00:17:47,800 --> 00:18:10,680
this

415
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
they make some points.

416
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,720
So, anyway, whether it's in now or

417
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,800
tomorrow, it's safe, and it locally

418
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,320
pronounce different codes, different

419
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,320
about what they understand.

420
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,480
So, what does that mean?

421
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,080
앉а pois о 오 mete Gentlemen students go first,

422
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,580
massive enthousiasm comes forth,

423
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,120
formulate itself.

424
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,920
paid in assets.

425
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,400
All compfitiousness benefits

426
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,860
pure and trepidation of the person

427
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:27,200
loyal of his fear.

428
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,160
and he was the king of the church.

429
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,360
He was the king of the church,

430
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,560
the king of the church of the family.

431
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,880
He had to file a lot of documents

432
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,440
which was very simple.

433
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,760
But the money was in his hands,

434
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,400
and he had to pay them back.

435
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
So he was very generous.

436
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,640
And what I should say,

437
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,680
everybody would be happy to see this.

438
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,400
I'm not going to just be

439
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,480
a guy who's in the university,

440
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,360
but the president of the board of the university,

441
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,840
and I'm going to be a student.

442
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,800
And I'm going to be a professor,

443
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,240
and I'm going to be a professor.

444
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,760
That's the spirit.

445
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,720
So he was emerging from that spirit

446
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,960
to the world of us.

447
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,400
And he began a growing of various kinds of armies

448
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,320
and religious foods and ideas

449
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,000
for himself and his class.

450
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,120
His father had dedicated himself

451
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,400
to the work he had done

452
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,360
and moved into a new direction

453
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,120
of pursuing the practice of

454
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,560
YouTube.

455
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,440
So then of course,

456
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,000
we get to a degree again

457
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,600
to this very basic type of thing

458
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,560
and Jacqueline,

459
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,080
and everything that you got

460
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,060
Ook番 생각버 into the totally

461
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,020
Anton Ailden route which comes

462
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,980
after the first Cor 4 year sixty

463
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,480
Well you know,

464
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,460
you have to look at,

465
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:42,980
or property which you will see in

466
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,020
card information which is can be HASGN.

467
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,300
And Internet of redo, they usually are

468
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,940
sometimes well- Donged and are.

469
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,500
At least the ____zzle on Facebook

470
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,980
and such, you generally now know

471
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,420
your IP address and how many

472
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:06,600
spots are

473
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,520
being ?

474
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,440
uggly which is well not

475
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,780
available today so a general

476
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,780
statement out there is

477
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,160
I can put ourselves on the list, but it's about...

478
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,820
if the children are good,

479
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,200
I'm not giving the best medicine just trying to end our pollen use up,

480
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,780
I'm not giving kids who have exactly the same drug use up the same amount of money

481
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,540
I'm going to get my nutrition into it first succeed

482
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,560
as soon as I get it into it

483
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,200
and it's a very small amount of work

484
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,900
because once this is in the hooks

485
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,020
it's really possible to go south east

486
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,280
that a

487
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,740
normal first success is not going to happen

488
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
It's an open

489
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,780
So I'm just going to talk a bit about some of the things that we've worked on in the past.

490
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,780
So we've all got the drive company about for cloud funding and we've also got the remote

491
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,780
service and it's time to find out if these projects are going to work for you.

492
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,780
And we've got a few things as well.

493
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,780
I'm going to talk a bit about specific things.

494
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,780
So I'm going to talk about some of the things that we've done in the past.

495
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,780
So we've got the response to the deployment and the development of the project.

496
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,780
And we'll be sticking with the new ideas from the state and what we've been doing in the city.

497
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,780
And I'm just going to go ahead and put it in front of you.

498
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,780
We've got a phone festival in the front of you that is coming up in the room.

499
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,780
So we're going to talk a little bit about those things in front of us.

500
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,780
I'm going to show you a couple of things that we've done in the past.

501
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,780
So let's go ahead and start.

502
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,780
Thank you.

503
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,780
Thank you.

504
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,780
Thank you.

505
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,780
Thank you very much, Matthew.

506
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,780
I'm going to start by asking you to now speak to us.

507
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,780
So you have been talking to us for three years now.

508
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,780
And it works very well.

509
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,780
It's very, very good.

510
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,780
And I'm just going to speak to you a little bit more because you have a screen in your

511
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,780
head that says, we have a phone.

512
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,780
It's not the first time we've done this.

513
00:22:53,780 --> 00:23:00,780
But we can recommend it to someone who's been in the city for a long time.

514
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,780
And the phone that I'm going to show you is in the back of your screen.

515
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,780
And you're going to see it in the back of your screen.

516
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,780
Thank you.

517
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,780
Thank you very much.

518
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,780
Thank you.

519
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,780
Thank you.

520
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,780
Thank you.

521
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,780
Thank you.

522
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,780
Thank you.

523
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,780
Thank you.

524
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,780
So, I'm going to give you something that's a little bit more

525
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,780
interesting.

526
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,780
So, I'm going to give you one of the most important things

527
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,780
that I'm going to talk about in this talk, which is the

528
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,780
importance of the language here.

529
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,780
And I'm going to give you some ideas on how to speak

530
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,780
in English.

531
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,780
And what works in English is that I'm going to talk about

532
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,780
the different ways in which English is used.

533
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,780
And I'm going to give you a little bit of a brief overview

534
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,780
of how to use English in this talk.

535
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,780
So, thank you.

536
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,780
But, thank you very much.

537
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,780
I'm going to give you a little bit of a summary of what

538
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,780
English is used for.

539
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,780
What it is, the words, the things that you can use

540
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,780
English for.

541
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,780
What it does, the features, the things that you use

542
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,780
English for.

543
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,780
What it's kind of the limitations that are used.

544
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,780
The things that you can use in the system that's not used.

545
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,780
So, I'm going to give you a little bit of a brief overview

546
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,780
of what English does.

547
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,780
So, I'm going to say a couple of things.

548
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,780
First, I'm going to give you a brief overview of the

549
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,780
language in which English is used.

550
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,780
And what is used for in English.

551
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,780
So, I'm going to give you a brief overview of the

552
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,780
everything died.

553
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,780
that一樣.

554
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,780
Eis y 120,azione 100 .

555
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,780
trabajar deategory avoided,

556
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,780
simplifying a CEOs

557
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,500
battlefield strategy

558
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,860
important,

559
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,660
but within the legal scattering

560
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:35,860
as early as it was

561
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,720
great.

562
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,480
So the technology should have been developed in ghost memory,

563
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:03,960
in

564
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:18,140
ghost memory.

565
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:31,640
그것을 웃ista

566
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,040
And if you tell me, it just doesn't seem like something

567
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,340
that's going to be used in this kind of technical question.

568
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,340
This is a question.

569
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,340
I'm not sure what the problem is.

570
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,740
The question is, how do we get rid of the error?

571
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,240
How do we get rid of the error that we want to make

572
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,440
if we use the option?

573
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,540
I don't understand the question.

574
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,040
I don't even know what it's like.

575
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,840
It's pretty difficult to do this in full,

576
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,240
this particular section.

577
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,540
I've got everything I need to do this on the basic.

578
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,540
I hope it works with this multi-part conference.

579
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,340
My other task is full of views.

580
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,940
Thank you very much, everybody.
