1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
See you everybody so that through these Beyoncé works you

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,260
are for drawing up this sucks day in and day out,

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,640
and you're here this dickать time.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:24,900
Coming into this introduction 2019

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,420
dramatic change.

6
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,420
Thank you everyone.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,420
Just a quick shout out to everyone who's been on the phone for a while.

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,420
I'm just going to give you a little bit of a tour of the things that we do.

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,420
We're going to be taking a look at Microsoft for the first time.

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,420
We're going to be having a look at Google Home and other things.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,420
If you run out of time, I will be hosting you.

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,420
Which is going to be a great, down to 80 people, at most.

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,420
Especially in a three-foot-feet-long software.

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,420
So if something gets too far away, you might ask for a quick look at the web page

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,420
or something like that.

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,420
Or just drop me an email.

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,420
I'll be right back.

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,420
So, I'll just be trying to speak a little bit.

19
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,420
Okay, thanks.

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,420
So, you probably get a point in what is the web page.

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,420
So, the way I define it is that the things that are not necessarily

22
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,420
in the case of the things that are actually working.

23
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,420
I mean, it's not that it's not working.

24
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,420
I mean, now I can actually just keep the additional things in there.

25
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,420
That's the absolute, every one of them is going to be supported.

26
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,420
Or, I don't know if you're not going to believe the ways that

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,420
what I need to do is work to make sure that it's not going to be

28
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,420
out there soon anyway.

29
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,420
But this is because if we have never given a software, we have never

30
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,420
thought about using it ever again.

31
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,420
We have to get it to the stage to get the same results that we need.

32
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,420
So, I think that might be a bad thing to do.

33
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,420
There's lots of people out there that don't know how to do something like that.

34
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,420
I mean, there'll be a lot of people out there that don't know how to do it.

35
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,420
But I think it's a great solution.

36
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,420
Yeah.

37
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,420
What I'd like to do is to put a little block face in the numbers, but I'm

38
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,420
going to put a little bit of the impact.

39
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,420
And so, I think I'm going to use for myself that work what I can use to

40
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,420
make sure that it's true.

41
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,420
So, I could actually say, so, I'm going to put a little bit of the

42
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,420
problems in place.

43
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,420
I'm going to just go to this block face.

44
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,420
That's far back where there was possibly a lot to do with this.

45
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,420
I think it's quite a big thing.

46
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,420
So, you have to use the other block face.

47
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,420
I think you're going to need it.

48
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,420
I was talking about respect.

49
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,420
So, you have to use that as a big thing to see what happens to people.

50
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,420
But you're going to see that that's great.

51
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,420
So, you're going to see that that's a great step up.

52
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,420
So, if I could bring the people who are in front of me to look, if I had a lot of

53
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,420
respect, I could take it in.

54
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,420
I think I could only look at the students who are both part of the

55
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,420
adolescents.

56
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,420
So, that's going to make me think about what's the best program to do.

57
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,420
And you can use manipulation that would teach every single person a lot of

58
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,420
hard work together.

59
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,420
But you can also use the other block face.

60
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,420
So, you can see the block face.

61
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,420
So, you can use the other block face.

62
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,420
I think that's all the gravity of the nation that contributes.

63
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,420
And it's truly worth the community and the people training in this program.

64
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,420
So, I can use both of those things to train the people that are in front of me.

65
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,420
I think that's what it's going to be.

66
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,420
So, I think it's going to be a great thing that it's got to be done.

67
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,420
It's so much more difficult to do this than just looking at the block face.

68
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,420
I think it's that.

69
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,420
There's the audience that's not here.

70
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,420
So, people don't know who you can call locals.

71
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,420
It's not a most comfortable place to be.

72
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,420
Maybe a couple of nights, a little bit of a long night for a week.

73
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,420
That's what you can do.

74
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,420
It's not a drop-down.

75
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,420
It's free.

76
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,420
So, you can't have anything to start here.

77
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,420
I think it's a good thing.

78
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,420
I was very involved in the production of the network.

79
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,420
It's not that great.

80
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,420
This is one of the largest things.

81
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,420
You know, we're going to do a lot of cool results.

82
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,420
I think that now it's going to be a lot of people coming to the speakers.

83
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,420
You can't have a church event, right?

84
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,420
So, it's a great thing to be part of.

85
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,420
You can't have a church event.

86
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,420
You know, if you're in jobs, there will be 10,000 people in the church events.

87
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,420
You cannot live with that.

88
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,420
So, I was very involved in the network.

89
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,420
I think it's really something that you can do to get to that level of success.

90
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,420
So, there's a lot of stuff that you can try to find that you might not realize.

91
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,420
You might see a block face.

92
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,420
But, you know, what I've worked on, I've been working on for a long time.

93
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,420
I've worked on a very nice one.

94
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,420
I've been working on that.

95
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,420
So, I hope you're able to bring that into your life.

96
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,420
It's a great thing to do.

97
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,420
It's a great opportunity to do that.

98
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,420
So, thank you.

99
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,420
Thank you, James.

100
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,420
In fact, I'm going to give away the mic to you today.

101
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,420
This is a fact that we've heard from some of the other folks in the office around the world

102
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,420
that the church is going to take what I've presented in this last year or so.

103
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,420
So, it's a bad thing to do.

104
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,420
It's a real person's bad thing.

105
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,420
But, I think that's a good idea.

106
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,420
I think you're right.

107
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,420
It's a good idea to do it.

108
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,420
Right in jury.

109
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,420
We're going to not be able to make room for crime.

110
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,420
We have to work and work to ensure we don't run into any justice.

111
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,420
I think we have to be a bit cautious to be honest.

112
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,420
So you can do anything you figure out if someone puts their door behind them,

113
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,420
do the tires.

114
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,420
And what's up with that?

115
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,420
We can't give up Citeρηκούη주� wage.

116
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,420
We've got others, just don't need to.

117
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,420
Other states…

118
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,420
I think we all like to read the ropes.

119
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,420
So, if you don't want to go to the rifleaming…

120
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,420
you can't.

121
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,420
How to tink comes.

122
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,420
Otherwise, you stick it up on the floor issues, as opposed to going through the EU.

123
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,420
So, remember that this is a rest.

124
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,420
These are not exactly racist.

125
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,420
So, kind of investors.

126
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:14,420
One, so while some of the questions that you need to think about

127
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,420
from a legal perspective, please, go to this one.

128
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,420
Also, when I think about this stuff, I want to give you an example.

129
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,420
So, one of these are the things that you can take down and you can

130
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,420
think of a form that you can use when you're engaged with them.

131
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,420
One of the things that you know, what you can do is do that

132
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,420
is do that form for a different organization, to progress with a different

133
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,420
organization. You can use it to come up with a style that you can use

134
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,420
when you're focused on it.

135
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,420
Okay, so I'll just talk about these.

136
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,420
So, I'm talking about just, you know, if you have your own

137
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,420
agency that you're focused on, you know.

138
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,420
So, you can go to any data market, see the information for biologists,

139
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:57,420
go into some web, medical web, still have a heavy weight on your shoulders.

140
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,420
Where is it? Is it directly in the series or on the other side of the

141
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,420
growth queue?

142
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,420
And, what does this have to do with fundamental numbers, right?

143
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,420
This is kind of the point I was talking about.

144
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,420
Actually, do you guys believe in fundamental learned capabilities where

145
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,420
there's enough individual investing?

146
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,560
And, just in terms of, you know, examples, you know,

147
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,560
we had a standard pump platform that was unfortunately taken down this

148
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,420
week, sohmmerano.bg.

149
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,420
We had it out this week.

150
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,420
We had a very big growth race, and that was basically ran out

151
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:36,420
We have a funfuntions point. We're going to use that as a query code in a custom. As I said,

152
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,420
you've got to go and keep that in the other container. So we've got to add a function in the

153
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,420
way you've got to construct this function that you've got to put in the other container.

154
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:50,420
And we're going to put things in the other container. The rules are hard because it's a problem,

155
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:56,420
but now, as I mentioned earlier, we've got those functions. You're using the way you can

156
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,420
create ridges using this function actually. If you thought that's a good thing, that's

157
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,420
not going to happen. But I do think that adding a function in the container is a great

158
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,420
way forward. And I think giving this class is a fair amount of time. So it's not hard to

159
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,420
give it a recoup before you do it. Our personal evaluators are about many, many different

160
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:20,420
people, but I'm actually making a different type of evaluation. So I just like that as

161
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,420
great for index. Okay. So that's a thing that we're going to work on.

162
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:30,420
Our second recommender is committeeArt.com. So no, I don't even know what committeeArt is

163
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:36,420
teaming up. No, both of these. So, the interesting thing is, we used THE STATES.

164
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,420
Our neighboring right is the scope of your type that is the whole box, which makes up

165
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,420
the whole thing at the end of it. Unit witheraming, overrolls ofagua based understand,

166
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:49,420
and else like, the l simplemente Compare the walks between theOY case, which is more

167
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,420
For example, first, when we started the systems, we had a rather complicated health system.

168
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,420
There was no good way to explore access to space, so I mean that by a lot.

169
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,420
That's what it's got to do, everything.

170
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,420
For the medical school, that's what that's supposed to do.

171
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,420
We might have to control it a lot more.

172
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,420
So I'm going to leave that.

173
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,420
So like that, there are two things we need to do.

174
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,420
One is to continue to reach and connect every other thing to the presence of Texas and the UK.

175
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,420
So, in terms of what?

176
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,420
Class, family, follow-up.

177
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,420
Technically, you can write your level code with just the same things.

178
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,420
You just take the same thing and you're good to go.

179
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,420
We're just going to move on.

180
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,420
Yeah, this is the basic calculus.

181
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:39,420
We've looked at some basic data, these are open-source, physical Python functions.

182
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,420
So, for those of you who don't know what a physical function is,

183
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,420
it's the fact that it's one of the most creative, scientific methods in the state of the human race.

184
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,420
Where it gives you the other three-fold in the process data.

185
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,420
And it makes commercial decision-making easier than it does.

186
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,420
We know what a physical function is.

187
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,420
We know what an exercise is.

188
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,420
We know what a physical function is.

189
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,420
We know what a physical function is.

190
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,420
We know what a physical function is.

191
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,420
We know what a physical function is.

192
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,420
We know what a physical function is.

193
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,420
So, those are the basic things we've done.

194
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,420
So, I think that's all I have to say about the physical functions.

195
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,420
So, thank you.

196
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,420
I don't know what's up down there, but I'm just going to go ahead and give a little bit of an overview.

197
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,420
Yeah.

198
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,420
I think that's all I have to say.

199
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,420
As I said earlier, there are like four things to focus on.

200
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,420
So, I'm going to give you some rather important features.

201
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,420
I'm going to just give you a little bit of a fact.

202
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,420
So, I'm going to go to a couple of things.

203
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,420
This is the post-transitional of the physical functions.

204
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,420
So, you can see the federal government's data from the federal government's data source.

205
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,420
So, I'm going to give you a little bit.

206
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,420
So, we're going to be looking at a lot of things that are, in its actual health and research,

207
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,420
actually responsive to the physical functions of physical functions.

208
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,420
So, I hope this is kind of a broad impact on the health of things that are going on in the city.

209
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,420
So, we're going to start with a very simple example.

210
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,420
Which is a very good example.

211
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,420
X.1.

212
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,420
X.1.

213
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,420
Now, I'm going to mention these components in the very,

214
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,420
we're going to be able to talk about them in the book.

215
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,420
We're going to be able to talk about them in the book.

216
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,420
We're going to be able to talk about them in the book.

217
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,420
But this is from a true physical function.

218
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,420
So, it's not going to affect the physical functions that we're talking about.

219
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,420
This is the question.

220
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,420
How do you distribute a data?

221
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,420
We're going to be able to talk about this in the book.

222
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,420
So, the answer is,

223
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,420
you know,

224
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,420
it's a very simple thing to do.

225
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,420
It's not a big deal.

226
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,420
But, it's okay to do it that way.

227
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,420
But, like I said,

228
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,420
you see, for an actual experience, you might want to

229
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,420
start with a very simple example.

230
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,420
You see, for example, this is a walk down function.

231
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,420
Now, it's very simple.

232
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,420
It's like a five-octave, and it's going to be an X.

233
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,420
That's it.

234
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,420
But, really, it's very simple.

235
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,420
It's always that way.

236
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,420
It's a very simple function.

237
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,420
It's a type of technical, it's practical, it's just a bit of

238
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,420
a do-or-die-by-the-sense,

239
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,420
but it's a few things.

240
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,420
It's a very, very fast, it's a little bit of a

241
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,420
tick-to-much-to-much.

242
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,420
So, that's it.

243
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,420
And the Prep and Digitizer,

244
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,420
as an example, is so easy.

245
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,960
So now, you have these little

246
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,500
Whoa-o-wow functions called

247
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
learnable speech functions called

248
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,740
diesels question nursing and

249
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,740
actually, we will use this in talks,

250
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,740
but it's not available here,

251
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,740
so, all that gets used,

252
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,740
if you all live in Texas,

253
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,880
feel free to check that out,

254
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,940
if you're carefullyrep sketched,

255
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,940
you'll realize that there is not much

256
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,620
to learn about in this webinar.

257
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,820
you don't have the right test name or

258
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,820
But we took out a lot of experiments.

259
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,820
We didn't get any results.

260
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,820
And we think something's missing, so we don't know.

261
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
So we've been providing decades of information to speak most

262
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,820
in spite of the fact that the structure of the proposal for the

263
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
Finder function, right, and then I think all of that function

264
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,820
would probably fail in passing.

265
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,820
So bra 큰 but The fflg bucket atleast

266
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,820
with some other secure developers to redesign and

267
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,820
improve the experiment and, just thinking that there

268
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,340
might be a need to technically do the experiment and

269
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:18,740
spaghetti out there is certainly an additional exercise

270
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,740
to help people to increase their possibility of

271
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,740
Many people have said that.

272
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,740
So, we decided to put that in place.

273
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,740
But, if I try to re-arrange it, I just don't think it works.

274
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:36,740
Because, I can write stuff that never happens on the right or the left,

275
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,740
but that's just in fact the classic, the classic,

276
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,740
and I could write that in a lot of definitions.

277
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,740
It specifically shows that the way that that's supposed to be accepted

278
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,740
is not available to any of the other groups,

279
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,740
and that's what you're supposed to do after you've built that.

280
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,740
So, again, that's the reason it's supposed to not necessarily be backstaged.

281
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,740
It's not something that's in the most of the guys' boxes to find for you.

282
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,740
And, again, you guys have to find any other places that you can get.

283
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,740
I don't think that's the only way to do it.

284
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,740
But, there's new examples of groups that are more near-trivial than much bigger.

285
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,740
That's that.

286
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,740
Like, I was already asked to do something like this to this.

287
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,740
And, also, people go like,

288
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,740
there's a lot of stuff like this, there's simulations in it,

289
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,740
but people really don't expect that.

290
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,740
Why? Because all these new, like,

291
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,740
new things are going to always like,

292
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,740
right, because of some of these things.

293
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,740
It's pretty clear.

294
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,740
I mean, what is it really?

295
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
What else?

296
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,740
We have some questions.

297
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,740
Yeah.

298
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,740
So,

299
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,740
how do you store a company that's in a major process

300
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,740
in a small-life customer?

301
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,740
So, these are all that kind of things, right?

302
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,740
Yes.

303
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,740
Another question that somebody's raising is,

304
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,740
what does managing mass data really do for people on small lives?

305
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,740
You mean how do you actively manage things,

306
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,740
how do you have to actually manage them?

307
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,740
And, like,

308
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,740
that's the farming area of the motorhome

309
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,740
and what do you see going on

310
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,740
with governments?

311
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,740
And, well, one of the things đi next year to think about that

312
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,740
is also getting rubber because…

313
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,740
but I think that is what I said before I came from Delhi,

314
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,740
Now, we're going to try to do all those things with this report,

315
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,740
but I'm different, but it's different.

316
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,740
There's a way to write this by the end of the slide.

317
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,740
That was the end of the presentation.

318
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,740
But, let's get back to the presentation.

319
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,740
So, what's my big problem?

320
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,740
We know that there is a great amount of people asking questions,

321
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,740
but how are the questions being asked?

322
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,740
Oh, okay. What was that question?

323
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,740
Oh, it was the question, okay.

324
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,740
Do I have a country that is pretty strong?

325
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,740
Okay, now I just have to raise it by myself.

326
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,740
Okay, so that's what you're talking about.

327
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,740
So, is this a right?

328
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,740
It's a right.

329
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,740
Now, in fact, we do have a few prototypes that we've been giving to see how far we've

330
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,740
stretched the range from the amount of people that have been asked questions.

331
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,740
But, interesting question.

332
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,740
So, we have the spell, probably, that we've been trying to find for a long time.

333
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,740
What happens when we're talking about prototypes?

334
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,740
We have a few more pieces that we have to find.

335
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,740
So, we've got some prototypes that we've been trying to find.

336
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,740
So, it's in the...

337
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,740
And there's actually a specific reason why we've invested in this particular format.

338
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,740
Because, basically, the reason we've done it is very much that

339
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,740
often the data is compiled into a set of reports,

340
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,740
and it's really simple.

341
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,740
So, it's a container of a set of reports,

342
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,740
so we're really looking at the limits of the use of the product.

343
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,740
Usually, we look at an existing project,

344
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,740
and we're like, okay, we're going to use this product.

345
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,740
But, this one has to be based on the actual use of the product.

346
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,740
And that gives us a lot of risk.

347
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,740
This is a solution that we have to use in a business job,

348
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,740
and this is extremely important.

349
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,740
So, we're not just actually waiting for the world to be

350
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,740
providing the product, it's really the data that's being used constantly.

351
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,740
So, we've made lots of notes, and there's a specific reason why we've done it.

352
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,740
There's a very specific way of trying to keep our data consistent.

353
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,740
So, we've used products like Ferri and Eksper.

354
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,740
So, again, you don't have to...

355
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,740
You'll get the choice, but basically,

356
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,740
what this will do is type up data,

357
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,740
like, the data you say, you'll get a base object,

358
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,740
and you'll get this type of box.

359
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,740
But, we want to make this a little more relevant

360
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,740
and at least actually provide a base object.

361
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,740
We were expecting to see the data being used in these products.

362
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,740
I've been thinking about this case,

363
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,740
it's been a common question.

364
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,740
One of those ads we've been making,

365
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,740
is we've created an ad with those,

366
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,740
we've been saying we're trying to create 5,000 products.

367
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,740
So, we've got the matching, there's another chance.

368
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,740
That's what makes it so difficult.

369
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,740
All of the potential elements of our product,

370
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,740
the components of our product,

371
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,740
they work together.

372
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,740
One of those things is the impact for the business.

373
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,740
So, if you said the house is too big,

374
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,740
and you can't fit stuff,

375
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,740
I would think there is a reason why we provide the right access.

376
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,740
There's a lot of other things that we can do.

377
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,740
It's the other function type.

378
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,740
Like that, we can reduce the pressure

379
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,740
to the right way, to the left way, to the left.

380
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,740
But reaching right is what you're going to do.

381
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,740
I think it's a little bit of a cost,

382
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,740
because this is all the different parts.

383
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,740
So, I would argue this is a little bit of a distinction.

384
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,740
But, you know, we're just going to

385
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,740
create the project for the first person,

386
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
for the entire team.

387
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,740
Because we want everything to look good for each other.

388
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,740
We all know if you're all like that,

389
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,740
5,000 products, we want to slow that down.

390
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,740
So, this is why we're trying to do all of that stuff.

391
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,740
Next, we'll go to the most complex of values

392
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,740
that have control points.

393
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,740
Create an object in X.

394
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,740
And what is the index of this?

395
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,740
And we have the regular size of this.

396
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,740
That's X minus one.

397
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,740
What does that mean?

398
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,740
And if we did like the steps three,

399
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,740
it would be the whole thing of just the first step.

400
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,740
And we're just going to put the first step in.

401
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,740
So, this is our first step.

402
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,740
We're going to do that on the second step.

403
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,740
So, first step, the second step.

404
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,740
The second step.

405
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,740
So, we have one and a half, one and a half, one and a half,

406
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,740
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

407
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,740
ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.

408
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,740
We're going to do some construction in the middle.

409
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,740
We want to hear about the five ways to do that.

410
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,740
We want to hear about that.

411
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,740
Yeah.

412
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,740
See, we've created six points.

413
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,740
But here's the question.

414
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,740
What index will let you decide about X minus one?

415
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,740
What index?

416
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,740
This is the first step.

417
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,740
Second step.

418
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,740
So, you've got to reach your family.

419
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,740
Right, this is the third step.

420
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,740
I've got things in pockets, quarter, and ounce, right?

421
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,740
And so, this is the people who have X plus one,

422
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,740
or X plus X, it means they're just in the middle of the degree.

423
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,740
So, just because X plus one could work,

424
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,740
X is the number of X plus one, we're good.

425
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,740
Does that mean Y has the desired index?

426
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,740
Y has the number of X plus one, we're good.

427
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,740
Excuse the question.

428
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,740
So, this is the case of this.

429
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,740
Right there, right?

430
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,740
So, we have all these, all these three points.

431
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,740
I want to discuss a few things.

432
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,740
The one half of the structure is the correct index, right?

433
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,740
So, the index number four, left.

434
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,740
What's the number of the index?

435
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,740
The O, the first one is the right-handed index.

436
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,740
So, this way, also, I've got a chance to try to make a whole situation right.

437
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,740
Now, here's one question.

438
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,740
What do you do if the right-handed is right?

439
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,740
How do you get yourself to do the right-handed work with the right-handed?

440
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,740
Okay.

441
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,740
So, if you look at the big picture,

442
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,740
you may have wondered what the design of the index is.

443
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,740
That's what I found out that in the operation structure,

444
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,740
you're going to say, hey, I'm not completely sure

445
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,740
this combination of stuff, please try some other shapes

446
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,740
of ways to get it to work, right?

447
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,740
So, for instance, this square, the number of sides of this thing,

448
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,740
and then, if you look at the index, that index starts

449
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,740
having a tendency to not do very much.

450
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,740
So, you can apply that to the four or five right-handed sides

451
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,740
to be the right-handed.

452
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,740
Now, I keep repeating this.

453
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,740
If you want to try to make that shape, it's a key to success.

454
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,740
The reason for this is that at this new level,

455
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,740
this could come about to be really just

456
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,740
S dot n, d z y comma x,

457
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,740
or the equivalent of the y-axis.

458
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,740
And in the estimation, there's a y-axis,

459
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,740
and it's very close to the exact same result as the second product

460
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,740
of the right-handed index.

461
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,740
So, once you have all those little boxes,

462
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,740
it's like a step.

463
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,740
The second piece of our practice is not where it starts to try to click.

464
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,740
We want to stick that to the triple-triple index

465
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,740
of the right-handed index.

466
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,740
Now, whether you've been doing stroke classes,

467
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,740
you might be working on the model.

468
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,740
But what happens before I want to do stroke classes,

469
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,740
I think that's a good thing.

470
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,740
And why is the difference between everything you do

471
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,740
over the right-handed index,

472
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,740
in terms of what is a program,

473
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,740
the second style of practice,

474
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,740
because you make sure that the index is kind of displayed

475
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,740
to make sure that your points get put in the right order

476
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,740
as in the other problems.

477
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,740
Now, there are rules for that.

478
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,740
So, if you want to lead your practice,

479
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,740
you have to start with the right-handed index.

480
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,740
So, it's like a foster rate,

481
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,740
but that's not the same as the left-handed index.

482
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,740
In case that it's difficult to kind of try

483
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,740
to build a better control over it.

484
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,740
First, you have to make sure that the index is in the right order.

485
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,740
So, you want to know, you've got the practice index,

486
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,740
right, but it's in the right order.

487
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,740
But to be a professor, then it's more regular.

488
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,740
You think about this because they're doing it

489
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,740
because you've got the stroke class,

490
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,740
you've got the right-handed index,

491
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,740
you've got the stroke class,

492
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,740
you've got the stroke class,

493
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,740
you've got the stroke class,

494
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,740
you've got the right-handed index,

495
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,740
and you've got the stroke class,

496
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,740
not the right-handed index.

497
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,740
That's not the same as the left-handed index.

498
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,740
So, there's a lot of ways to get into the stroke class

499
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,740
when you're in college.

500
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,740
There's one person who needs to do this,

501
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,740
there's some class, and then you go home.

502
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,740
Now, you want to also make sure that

503
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,740
you've got the right-handed index,

504
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,740
that you've got the right-handed index,

505
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,740
and you want to make sure they're different.

506
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,740
What's going to do on a research site

507
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,740
like the CFA?

508
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,740
You go on a research site,

509
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,740
you go to a research site for commercial,

510
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,740
you're taking the other person,

511
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,740
if you are a particular person,

512
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,740
you have to go to a course,

513
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,740
you have to go to a private class,

514
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,740
but don't go outside.

515
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,740
It's like that.

516
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,740
What's the point of going to a different place?

517
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,740
So, you just have to be able to make

518
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,740
a big step between more personal

519
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,740
and personal experience.

520
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,740
So, it's a clear commitment to yourself.

521
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,740
So, the role of the CFA is to decide

522
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,740
whether you want to apply to the research

523
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,740
or just go to the other side.

524
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,740
You try it when you have to

525
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,740
get the stroke and not the class.

526
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,740
Okay?

527
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,740
So, this is how you increase the

528
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,740
bench of time, right?

529
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,740
So, you start to pick up the other person

530
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,740
who took the phone call

531
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,740
to just do a funny operation.

532
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,740
This role plays a role in everything.

533
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,740
It does not.

534
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,740
It doesn't play it.

535
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,740
And this is just with it.

536
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,740
It's not a fun way to do it.

537
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,740
It's a fun way.

538
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,740
Like, you usually have a good time

539
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,740
to get some fun.

540
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,740
And it is really smart,

541
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,740
I'm sure you've had a good time

542
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,740
with the class.

543
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,740
There's a way to work with the

544
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,740
training program and the training program.

545
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,740
This is why the process is so important

546
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,740
to you and your child.

547
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,740
It's not something that's at the level

548
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,740
of your kid coming.

549
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,740
Your doctor is going to tell you

550
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,740
that you need to do that.

551
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,740
And you need to do that

552
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,740
and you need to get those over with.

553
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,740
Right?

554
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,740
Now, once we've done this,

555
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
that is what it takes to get

556
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,740
the right person.

557
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,740
What do you say?

558
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,740
Okay.

559
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,740
Okay.

560
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,740
Okay.

561
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,740
So, it's all about the way you do it.

562
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,740
It's all about the way you do it.

563
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,740
It's all about the way you do it.

564
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,740
It's not just about the stroke and the touch.

565
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,740
But once you have a strong

566
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,740
concentration of a lot of those people

567
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,740
you need to get that through

568
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,740
the rest of the day,

569
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,740
it's a trouble maker.

570
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,740
You're like,

571
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,740
you're going to think about

572
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,740
that's not as far away

573
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,740
that what the right side is going to try

574
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,740
to do.

575
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,740
That's where you're going to

576
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,740
step up things and what things

577
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,740
you don't know where you want to go.

578
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,740
We hope this next year is a good one

579
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,740
so that all the contracted children

580
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,740
that we do out there

581
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,740
get that out of there

582
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,740
to the people outside of it.

583
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,740
But also that it's going to be

584
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,740
a good, good, good

585
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,740
and complete and complete and complete

586
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,740
and complete and complete.

587
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,740
Okay.

588
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,740
And we're going to have all the time

589
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,740
to make sure that we have time

590
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,740
to answer these questions.

591
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,740
I'm going to go into how

592
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,740
and show you how to prepare

593
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,740
a public-private combo

594
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,740
and how to share

595
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,740
cash and stuff.

596
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,740
So,

597
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,740
times the amount of money.

598
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,740
Good.

599
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,740
That's cool.

600
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,740
Okay.

601
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,740
How much money do you think

602
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,740
we have?

603
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,740
Okay.

604
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,740
That's a good one.

605
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,740
So, what are your

606
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,740
relationships with

607
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,740
these people?

608
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,740
I'm going to get some

609
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,740
information on the

610
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,740
biggest questions.

611
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,740
And you know,

612
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,740
while it's a lot of work,

613
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,740
it's very specific

614
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,740
and it's very easy

615
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,740
to find the right

616
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,740
to get the information right.

617
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,740
And that's basically

618
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,740
what happens in the future.

619
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,740
But, you might know something.

620
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,740
We don't have like

621
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,740
a whole lot of information

622
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,740
in the future

623
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,740
that is going to get

624
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,740
spread out

625
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,740
and I think we are going to

626
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,740
have to think about that.

627
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,740
But,

628
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,740
we might have the right

629
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,740
to get it right.

630
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,740
That's one of the

631
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,740
one of the most important

632
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,740
questions.

633
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,740
Okay.

634
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,740
So,

635
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,740
basically,

636
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,740
the great

637
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,740
kind of

638
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,740
different stuff

639
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,740
that we have

640
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,740
is that we're going to

641
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,740
have to think about it.

642
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,740
I'll also say

643
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,740
that it's really

644
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,740
very important

645
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,740
because it's

646
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,740
essentially

647
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,740
sort of

648
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,740
affects

649
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,740
a lot of

650
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,740
different things

651
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,740
and that's

652
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,740
going to be

653
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,740
a big difference

654
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,740
in the future.

655
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,740
But,

656
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,740
that's great.

657
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,740
I think that's

658
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,740
a really

659
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,740
not

660
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,740
a really easy

661
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,740
way to

662
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,740
address that

663
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,740
especially

664
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,740
with the

665
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,740
sort of

666
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,740
stuff that

667
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,740
we're

668
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,740
going to be

669
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,740
talking about

670
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,740
in the future.

671
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,740
And,

672
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,740
I think

673
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,740
that's

674
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,740
really

675
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,740
important.

676
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,740
Okay.

677
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,740
So,

678
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,740
basically,

679
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,740
the great

680
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,740
kind of

681
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,740
different

682
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,740
things

683
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,740
that

684
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,740
we're

685
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,740
going to

686
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,740
be talking about

687
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,740
is

688
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,740
the

689
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,740
kind of

690
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,740
things

691
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,740
that

692
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,740
we're

693
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,740
going to

694
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,740
be talking about

695
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,740
in the future.

696
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,740
So,

697
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,740
that's

698
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,740
really

699
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,740
important.

700
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,740
And,

701
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,740
I think

702
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,740
that's

703
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,740
a really

704
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,740
important

705
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,740
thing.

706
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,740
So,

707
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,740
that's

708
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,740
really

709
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,740
important.

710
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,740
And,

711
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,740
I think

712
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,740
that's

713
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,740
really

714
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,740
important.

715
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
So,

716
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,740
the

717
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,740
sort of

718
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,740
important

719
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,740
things that

720
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,740
we're

721
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,740
going to

722
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,740
be talking about

723
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,740
in the

724
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,740
future.

725
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,740
So,

726
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,740
that's

727
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,740
really

728
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,740
important.

729
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,740
And,

730
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,740
I think

731
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,740
that's

732
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,740
really

733
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,740
important.

734
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,740
So,

735
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,740
that's

736
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,740
really

737
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,740
important.

738
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,740
So,

739
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,740
that's

740
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,740
really

741
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,740
important.

742
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,740
So,

743
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,740
that's

744
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,740
really

745
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,740
important.

746
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,740
So,

747
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,740
it's

748
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,740
really

749
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,740
important.

750
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,740
So,

751
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,740
that's

752
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,740
really

753
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
important.

754
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,740
So,

755
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
I think that's

756
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,740
really

757
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,740
important.

758
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
So,

759
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,740
that's

760
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,740
really

761
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,740
important.

762
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,740
And,

763
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,740
I think

764
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,740
that's

765
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,740
really

766
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,740
important.

767
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,740
So,

768
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,740
that's

769
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,740
really

770
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,740
important.

771
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,740
So,

772
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,740
I'm pretty much one of two schools who are interested in the field.

773
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:46,740
Coming up here is the life of the real financial person,

774
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,740
the type of guy who works for a much more viable type of entity

775
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,740
because it's a good story.

776
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,740
I could just come to that if you want to know more about it.

777
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,740
So that's my story.

778
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,740
Unfortunately, I have two extra questions from that institution

779
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,740
that I think is most important.

780
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,740
If you want to try to get the company's full frame,

781
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,740
if you want to try to buy my truckings,

782
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,740
put them between the two of them,

783
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,740
or if you want to put them between the two of them.

784
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,740
Right.

785
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,740
And I also have a question for you,

786
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,740
which is by the way, coming out of the six record,

787
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,740
that's what it seems to me, but no.

788
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,740
All right, let's go to the questions.

789
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,740
I have a question.

790
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,740
I think we have a question.

791
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,740
I have a question about the fact that

792
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,740
when you say being a coach,

793
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,740
that's my basic thought.

794
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,740
So if you make a few decisions,

795
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,740
you're going to be a coach.

796
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,740
And the first thing that comes to mind

797
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,740
is that if things are not going to be the same,

798
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,740
then you're going to be a coach.

799
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,740
So I want to give you the answer.

800
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,740
I work for a government institution.

801
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,740
I do work for a financial institution.

802
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,740
So I mean, we are basically doing something in the community.

803
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,740
I 꼐 yes.

804
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,740
We are then doing things to some extent.

805
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,740
I think you would really be wise to think about

806
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,740
that the white people actually have this understanding

807
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,740
how to respond to the situation.

808
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,740
They Villain why do they have this understanding,

809
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,740
especially with your way of defending an interest

810
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,740
because you know policymakers need to respect themselves.

811
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,740
So do you want the probably the right people

812
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,740
inside making decisions because

813
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,740
pretty much этого es definitely possible.

814
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,740
So, I think it's fine now.

815
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,740
If it works, we're very careful about that.

816
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,740
And I think it's fine now.

817
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,740
And I think it's a good thing to have a copy.

818
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
Okay.

819
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,740
So, those guys just sort of,

820
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,740
they were really just trying to set things up.

821
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,740
They were actually setting up.

822
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,740
So, it's been a lot of the right things.

823
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,740
Just really focused pretty quickly this week.

824
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,740
So, just go back to the basics.

825
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,740
So, that's what I think.

826
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,740
Now, we've also opened the windows of the ancient buildings.

827
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,740
We have been thinking this the same stuff.

828
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,740
It's really nice to be able to actually look at what it looks like.

829
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,740
So, yes, we need to actually look at what it looks like.

830
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:19,740
So, in the early years of the original construction,

831
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,740
you were using the way you did the way you did the effects together.

832
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,740
And you can really see that in the effects.

833
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,740
The effects are really nice.

834
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,740
I just want to put a little bit of that down.

835
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,740
Like, the deposit, though.

836
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,740
Yeah, so those are still in the early days.

837
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,740
So, that's exactly what I was talking about.

838
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,740
So, we're just going to go through that.

839
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,740
And just move on to the basic things.

840
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,740
And it's been a really good thing.

841
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,740
So, I think it's very good.

842
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,740
Yeah, good.

843
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,740
There's a whole set of posts about the building.

844
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,740
And I think that's a really good thing.

845
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,740
Yeah, I think that's a really good thing.

846
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,740
I think that's a really good thing.

847
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,740
Thank you very much.

848
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,740
Thanks.

849
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,740
Thanks.

850
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,740
Thanks.
