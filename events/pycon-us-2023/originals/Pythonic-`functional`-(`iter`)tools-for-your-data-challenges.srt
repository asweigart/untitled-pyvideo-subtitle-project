1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hmm ...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,540
I A.

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,300
Try to get this from the front.

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:04,880
Honest.

5
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,040
For now, I try to read some names.

6
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,180
These are not changing at all.

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,540
It's obvious.

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,220
It's like a video of an anucksle

9
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,740
if you put them here.

10
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,120
My pen.

11
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,960
Ask.

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,680
Tell.

13
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,160
How do we say?

14
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,420
This page here.

15
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,160
See?

16
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,760
The book has the same grammar,

17
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,440
but the z Track skip is notMüzik.

18
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,460
Unfortunately,

19
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,700
this part is the cake.

20
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:50,100
Today I have two

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,820
We're working really hard for it.

22
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,700
And we're also working for this.

23
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,220
We're in 20th of March, we're in the city,

24
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,620
we're in Britain, we're in the city of London,

25
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,300
we're in the UK, we're in the UK of London,

26
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,980
and we're sending them home.

27
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,540
They're in a little bit of a different country,

28
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,940
and we're doing great.

29
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,300
We're happy.

30
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,980
We're in the city of London,

31
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,620
we're sending them home, we're in the city of London,

32
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,500
we're in the city of London,

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,300
and we're making this country a great country.

34
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,260
So, thank you for the wonderful talk we've been able to make.

35
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,460
Yes.

36
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,740
Hmm, well it's not quite so,

37
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,380
it's absolutely difficult,

38
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,180
but overall, difficult.

39
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,740
So, it's really nice really,

40
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,980
I'm not exactly sure

41
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,940
how to describe it,

42
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,860
but it was good,

43
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,140
which off stepping的是 tight,

44
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,780
which, yes, is important.

45
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,900
And the fact is the Ro導 jumper

46
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,140
is certainly one that you'll find

47
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,100
at the back of the fireky

48
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,100
worry jumper

49
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,060
which is essentially

50
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,300
anything

51
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,620
that will sink into the central Data circle.

52
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:54,740
It is a good thing that the production of this work contains so much of the time we need.

53
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:00,220
We have contributedこんにちは and but unfortunately obviously it is a big honor and

54
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:06,780
we have to sacrifice this opportunity, this great opportunity with the instrument and

55
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,960
massTime will be Welcome.

56
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,240
And we take special place in public.

57
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,520
only if you focused all of them in different Jackson.

58
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,080
In other words, if you found something that you would rarely find,

59
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,060
it does not have anything to do with any different and it does not mean

60
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,920
that you cannot either get some of it to everybody.

61
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,860
Knowing that if you incorporate in some conditions.

62
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,960
Someone said that you just want to find more of the power

63
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,840
that you will need to the abilities

64
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,240
more commonly used in supplementary and appreciative

65
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,720
invitations or invitations of our student coordinates

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,680
that we callberger controversial.

67
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,020
UMC actually needed theCreation

68
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,520
mapping for our study carefully

69
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,740
to avoid children that are experiencing

70
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,180
things that explain voluntary invitations

71
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,740
of people that are experiencing

72
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,140
disability needs in particular

73
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,360
study ofical issues.

74
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:27,120
allowance dates to about an account of 45 million users and users are able to contact

75
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:56,000
There's also a lot of the

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,480
And then they are working out.

77
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,740
And then down the stage they are going to use

78
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,900
saxophone, they'll go round,

79
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,640
we'll use support legendary.

80
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,600
And, you see instructed them

81
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,580
and actually,

82
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,540
every day's content is perfect,

83
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,080
that focus and the林ke

84
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,800
is using the complete of it

85
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,980
to actually say about it

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,820
we're on the road

87
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,340
to new features.

88
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,500
And you can see

89
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,380
there are two different recognitions

90
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,500
going on around the Holo Mitchell nature.

91
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,100
and then I found some really interesting things

92
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,100
that I really didn't want to do.

93
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,900
And that's why I decided to do it.

94
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,100
And I was kind of disappointed.

95
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,500
I was really told that I didn't want to start with it,

96
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,100
but definitely I didn't want to.

97
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,700
And I just thought that if I didn't do it,

98
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,700
it would be difficult and not cool.

99
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,900
I thought I didn't want to do it.

100
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,700
I was very disappointed with myself.

101
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,700
And so I decided to do it.

102
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,700
And I was really happy with the result.

103
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,700
And that's it.

104
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,300
I'm going to talk about some things that I really didn't want to do.

105
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,300
I'm not going to discuss them today.

106
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,100
But I thought that I was going to do it.

107
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,300
I was really disappointed with myself.

108
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,300
And I thought I was going to do it.

109
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,700
And so I decided to do it.

110
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,500
And I loved it.

111
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,300
And because I digged back through it,

112
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,500
I wanted to do it.

113
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,900
I actually wanted to do it.

114
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,200
Not that I just did,

115
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,600
but I also wanted to do it.

116
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:41,140
And I was really come we left it sit for us and were waiting for his usping back to everything why

117
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,740
it was even If you live in a lot of countries near in it that it was a bit,

118
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,140
you know,

119
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,520
But there was a lot of people there.

120
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,520
the

121
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,520
the

122
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,520
the

123
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,520
the

the

the

the

the

the

180
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,520
and I think that's a very important point.

181
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,520
I think that's a very important point.

182
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,520
I think that's a very important point.

183
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,520
I think that's a very important point.

I think that's a very important point.

I think that's a very important point.

I think that's a very important point.

188
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,520
I think that's a very important point.

189
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
I think that's a very important point.

190
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,520
I think that's a very important point.

191
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,520
I think that's a very important point.

192
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,520
I think that's a very important point.

193
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,520
I think that's a very important point.

194
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
I think that's a very important point.

195
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,280
I think that's a very important point.

196
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
I think that's a very important point.

197
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,280
I think that's a very important point.

198
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,280
I think that's a very important point.

199
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
I think that's a very important point.

200
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,180
I think that's a very important point.

201
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I think that's a very important point.

202
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
It's very spring and autumn.

203
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
It mind you spring, autumn, autumn season,

204
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
a very healthy spring season.

205
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:49,600
�

206
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
And if you think about the past,

207
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,040
you know, from the time to which he had been

208
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,880
is really insurmountable.

209
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,600
And it is insurmountable to think that he would be home.

210
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,060
Because you have to remember that

211
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,560
as he was talking to his family this evening,

212
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,840
he was saying to himself,

213
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,780
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, goodbye.

214
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,120
I don't know if you can understand it

215
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,980
or it sounds very important to me.

216
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,100
But I'm just saying to you,

217
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,800
this is a very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

218
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,080
very, very, very, very, very, very, very interesting,

219
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,560
very interesting, and very, very interesting,

220
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,320
very, very, very, very white.

221
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,200
And the VA gave this kind of sloping privacy

222
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:40,860
to the whole

223
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,620
abundant across most of southern Professor John.

224
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,940
Professor John cannot be ignored within a week of him

225
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,280
as subjects are wod for the mission community

226
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,280
and even in the faced indoor where

227
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,820
you'd be a kick out all your participated

228
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,600
that could be more likely made to facebook

229
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,340
that that work by

230
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,940
they'd be followed through

231
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,180
during 합니다 also

232
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,900
in certain settings

233
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,300
since we've seen

234
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,680
those stuff of their own

235
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,760
I'll explain inctors and companies

236
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
that is, the first thing that I would say is that

237
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
when you're doing the conversion,

238
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,760
you don't have to do it so you can do it in the best way.

239
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,760
The first thing is that there is a way

240
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
that you can get the people in the transition

241
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,760
to do the conversion.

242
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
You have to get the people in the transition

243
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,760
to do the change that you need.

244
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
And that's what I do.

245
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,760
I have a space for it to be built.

246
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,760
So I think that it's a good idea to do it.

247
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,760
I think that it's a good idea to do it.

248
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,760
And I would say that

249
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,760
I think that it's a good idea to do it.

250
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,760
And I think that

251
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
I think that it might be more natural

252
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
for people to do the transition later

253
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,760
than it is to do it now.

254
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,760
But I think that it's a good idea

255
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
to do it and to assume that it's a good idea

256
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,760
to do the conversion in the best way.

257
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,760
So, speaking about the transition,

258
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,760
I would say that

259
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
it's a good idea to do the transition

260
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
with some politics again,

261
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,760
with a policy that's having a lot better

262
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
than it is currently, actually,

263
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
than it is currently in the current situation.

264
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,760
I would say that

265
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
I would say that

266
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
I think that it's a good idea

267
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,760
to do the transition in the best way.

268
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
But I would also say that

269
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
I think that it's a good idea

270
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
to do the transition

271
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,760
with some politics again,

272
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,760
with a policy that's having

273
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
a lot better than it is currently,

274
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760
and that's a good idea to do it later.

275
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,760
I think that it's a good idea

276
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,760
to do it in a way that

277
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,760
is not a good idea to do it now.

278
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,760
But I would say

279
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,760
that it's a good idea, for example,

280
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,760
to essentially get the transition

281
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,760
in the best way.

282
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,760
I would say that it's a good idea

283
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
to do the transition

284
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
with some politics,

285
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,760
to get the transition

286
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,760
in the best way,

287
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,760
and that's a good idea to do it later.

288
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
So, I would say that

289
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
I think that it's a good idea

290
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,760
to do the transition

291
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,760
in a way that is

292
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,760
basically the same one that I said earlier,

293
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
in that I think that it's

294
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,760
a good idea to do the transition

295
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,760
between the character and the politics

296
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,760
that we're doing in many different youth groups in the world today

297
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,760
and that we're jet lagging

298
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,760

299
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
in each of those fields.

300
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,760
These are the same subjects

301
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,760
which I've combined with the

302
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,760

00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,760

We don't like to hear people talking about how political things are not going to change forever even though

322
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:37,260
week because I'm too tired of working in the office now.

323
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,240
We decided to take a different view.

324
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,840
It was an international project.

325
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,480
We wanted a different architecture,

326
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,400
with many different things,

327
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,460
from different directions.

328
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,180
Let's just get back to making a manifestation

329
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,340
the homework,

330
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,780
which is basically for special objects,

331
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,940
especially for everyday ثrete accountants,

332
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,940
and everything that you will see in the first.

333
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,940
And the pure, the first and the most

334
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,940
sensible way to say that you're going to do it,

335
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,940
is to do it with the training,

336
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,940
the level of the training,

337
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,940
and the training that you're going to do,

338
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,940
and the level of the training that you're going to do,

339
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,940
and the level of the training that you're going to do,

340
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,940
and the level of the training that you're going to do,

341
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,940
and the level of the training that you're going to do,

342
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,940
and the level of the training that you're going to do,

343
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,940
and the level of the training that you're going to do,

344
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,060
and the level of the Wednesdaystes only three decades.

345
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,140
And some of those days also became

346
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,140
limited in level with the Jay Pal swells.

347
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,160
I've come down,

348
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,860
did a little play around a few times

349
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,360
in the day 對 בת Goldenido nothe day,

350
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360

from閃entswomen.

352
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,160
Because of that, for the time for a few weeks ago

353
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,980

introduction and it is

interesting, first

you

369
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,460
and that's been moving to the truth.

370
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,460
We're trying to figure out if they're going to work on it

371
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,460
or if they're going to turn it into a new puzzle.

372
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,460
And this is a whole other puzzle that's going to follow.

373
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,460
This is a solution that I think is going to be a great thing

374
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,460
to do in the future, and I hope that people will be able

375
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,460
to help us in this discussion of the actual risk.

376
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,460
And this will be the most interesting thing to do.

377
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,460
I think that's a good point.

378
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,460
I think that we're going to be able to do it in the future.

379
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,460
So, the solution to the puzzle is that we're going to be able

380
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,460
to work on the actual risk of the puzzle, and I hope that people

381
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,460
will be able to help us in this discussion of the actual risk

382
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,460
of the puzzle.

383
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:41,460
So, this is a very interesting solution that we're going to be

384
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,460
able to work on.

385
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,460
It's going to be a very interesting one.

386
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,460
I think that we're going to be able to work on it in the future.

387
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,460
So, I think that we're going to be able to work on the actual risk

388
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,460
of the puzzle.

389
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,460
I think that we're going to be able to work on the actual risk of the

390
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
puzzle.

391
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,460
So, I think that we're going to be able to work on the actual risk of the

392
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,460
puzzle.

393
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,460
I think that we're going to be able to work on the actual risk of the

394
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,460
puzzle.

395
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,460
I think that we're going to be able to work on the actual risk of the

396
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,460
puzzle.

397
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,460
I think that we're going to be able to work on the actual risk of the

398
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,460
puzzle.

399
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,460
I think that we're going to be able to work on the actual risk of the

400
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,460
puzzle.

401
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,460
I think that we're going to be able to work on it in the future.

402
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,460
Yes, Speaker.

403
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,460
I think that we're going to be able to work on the actual risk of the

404
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,460
puzzle.

405
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,460
Yes, I think that we're going to be able to work on the actual risk of the

406
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,460
puzzle.

407
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,460
I think that we're going to be able to work on the actual risk of the

408
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,820
For example, if you just set up a business that's going to be there,

409
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,020
if you get some money, you're going to get a lot more money,

410
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,220
but you're not going to be very bad in the street.

411
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,580
And it's interesting that this person does expect that

412
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,980
this is going to be a little bit of a change.

413
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,700
I don't think that could happen by a simple,

414
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,620
but very clear year, that you get a little bit of a change

415
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,860
in the house.

416
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,860
But I think that it's going to be a change

417
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,140
in the value of the money that's going to be there.

418
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,620
I think that it's going to be a big change in the value of the money.

419
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,860
This is interesting because in the event

420
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,620
that this is going to be organized to do with data,

421
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,700
so it's a big change, and I think it's going to be very full-back.

422
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,860
And all the services that are in this area

423
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,100
are going to be taken into account

424
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,580
when you're ready for what you're doing.

425
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,780
And I think this is a big change that we're going to have

426
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,580
with the administration.

427
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,860
And so, I feel that the end of the season

428
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,460
might be a bit different than any other season.

429
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,180
So, it's important to start earlier than anything else.

430
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,500
To start huring data from city,

431
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,100
thinks it's going to be a shift in how we keep it separate,

432
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,940
as a team, all the time,

433
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,220
but it's a big change,

434
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,020
because you don't have so many shots of data.

435
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,100
I see that in state victorious.

436
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,260
And I feel that big changes will eventually come

437
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,580
when there's a choice available

438
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,420
that needs to be done in the الأminister of data

439
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:12,260
I think that this is a very interesting video to make, and I think that when it gets released,

440
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,340
I just think that there are a lot of things that are, that are not very interesting, but

441
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,860
that are definitely something that I should be talking about, so I'm going to try to

442
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,820
look at it this way, but I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it, but I'm going

443
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,820
to be able to do it because, you know, because I'm going to be doing a lot of stuff, and

444
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,860
I'm going to be doing a lot of stuff, and I'm going to be doing a lot of stuff, and

445
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:43,060
I'm going to take all of this information, and then, and then this is the whole picture

446
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:50,980
and I'm going to take a look at this so I don't bite off here.

447
00:21:50,980 --> 00:22:01,300
So I'm just going to start with something, from what I've been looking at at the past,

448
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,300
This is the final benefit.

449
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,640
I think that the health care system will be really

450
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,740
close to the steps we'll be doing.

451
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,220
But it's really being done in a way that will make

452
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,900
a difference in the economy.

453
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,100
And I think that will be a big contribution

454
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,500
that we have made to the need for the health care system

455
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,580
we can achieve.

456
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:24,140
And I think that we can have some benefits.

457
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,700
This is the final benefit.

458
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,500
I think that we're still focusing on the health

459
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:54,320
care system because there's an respects and

460
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,600
it would be really big use可 SOL VAC.

461
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,600
This is something that affects the subtitles of enhancements.

462
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,600
There are some etcetera within my approach,

463
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,600
for instance, who started writing however they are most often onlyone series,

464
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,600
orЖz, although I am not the editental author.

465
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,740
And finally, when following step-by-step Pain,

466
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:29,900
so that they might be leasing reflects to make a day of a song Delicious Right.

467
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,380
Thanks to the McDonald's sexual respect of that kind of processing,

468
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:40,960
and also possible research that can make people peace in the classroom.

469
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,720
In particular, since I'm talking so much about the subject of TFall Space,

470
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
Yahhh.

471
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,700
Hopefully, we will be involved inLLIFT, baby, he is going to be the kinda desert in a

472
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,220
desert Finland pert 나�h rid desj jaud roo.

473
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,560
民 jeunese ration.

474
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,280
Both are meant to decide which man and what man are the hunt?

475
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:13,720
Both Ac assistant manager Mr.

476
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,720
and that's what we're going to do for this year's event.

477
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,720
I think that we're going to be able to think about

478
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,720
the future of the people that we're going to be able to

479
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,720
play with and maybe even better than we were before.

480
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,720
We have a lot of things that we're going to be able to do

481
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,720
and it's going to be interesting to think about the future

482
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
of the people that we're going to be taking into account

483
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,720
and we're going to be able to make a few changes

484
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,720
and some changes that will actually have a big impact

485
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,720
on the future of the people that we're going to be

486
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
taking into account today,

487
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
if we're able to do something like that,

488
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,720
then I think that's something that we're going to be

489
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,720
able to work together on the basis that we're going to

490
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
be able to take into account the people that we're going to

491
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
be taking back to the kind of people that we're taking

492
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,720
into account today.

493
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,720
Then, J.P. Julian bending down to turn on his horn

494
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,280
to explain what he was actually speaking about.

495
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,780
What was the logic behind this question?

496
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,300
I think we need to know the answers

497
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,840
beyond that uncertainty point.

498
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,320
For example, some of the things we are concerned about

499
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,660
is that the Indian author, tabla,

500
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,540
found some heavily

501
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,940
misinterpreted parts

502
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,320
of hisolina about many names called midas,

503
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,160
referring to the people who wrote thisús scare pale

504
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,680
teacher of bedtime literature forcing him up

505
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,960
onto the gun always?

506
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,720
so I try to find a way to do the same,

507
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,920
using the same obserences by creepilyder's things

508
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,560
in order for them to understand

509
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,960
the three agents in it first.

510
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,100
The excellent,

511
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,960
we can have some prerogative,

512
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,260
guess we don't need that because we believe in it,

513
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,960
but we can also see what these ledges

514
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,620
and defenses of our focuses,

515
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,760
and then we can years to go

516
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,260
było, straight into the also.

517
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:09,260
I'm not sure if this is the first step in the progress calendar,

518
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,260
but I think that we should have done this.

519
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,260
I think that some of the things that we have done

520
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,260
and I think that we should have done,

521
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,260
are now the latest function,

522
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,260
the latest function for our country.

523
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,260
So this will be the first thing to do.

524
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,260
So I think that we should take a look.

525
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,260
I think that we should take a look at the next step.

526
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,260
This is the first step in the progress calendar.

527
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,260
So this is the next step.

528
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,260
If I think about it a little bit,

529
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,260
we have done the bolder thing,

530
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,260
the planter, the planter.

531
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,260
The planter.

532
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,260
Yes.

533
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,260
The next step is the planter.

534
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,260
And we are on the next step.

535
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,260
I think we've done this so that

536
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,260
I think we are really good at our job.

537
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,260
So this is the next step.

538
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,260
The next step.

539
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,260
The next step is the first step.

540
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:03,960
a single node in the project is useful in the management tree

541
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:13,760
usually the F sobie is found which is a sc Pearson-cell Estoy

542
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,560

543
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:25,760

544
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,100
true

545
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:36,300
However, I am very proud to be izle

546
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:41,400
WHO represents to be united

547
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:50,840
a TurboM법

548
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,840
So, I made everything that it does in a very interesting way.

549
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,840
And I'm going to show you a couple of things that I've done at the start.

550
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,840
So, in fact, I'm going to show you a few examples.

551
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,840
I'm still in the middle of the development of the key.

552
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,840
And I'm going to show you a few examples of that.

553
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,840
So, I'm going to show you a couple of examples of that.

554
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,840
shine hard, WhatsApp hands aren't ever used now

555
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,840
This was one book, there wouldn't ever be an 11 distraction

556
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,840
that was supporting base packets.

557
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,840
And with that some people were coming back and sending people back packets.

558
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,720
more some have introduced, it has been second to second monthly

559
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,940
Dieser Xian, the newcomer, these are pretty uniqueall

560
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:42,840
Maybe we'll Eagle waves

561
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,240
Look out for this next chapter of our brilliant vision

562
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,240
o th elegaking for discipline,

563
00:28:49,240 --> 00:29:01,360
o the

564
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,360
This is a very interesting topic that is very very unique,

565
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,360
but I think it's very very valuable to some people,

566
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,360
and especially to this subject.

567
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,360
This is a subject that is largely introduced

568
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,360
by many conservative people in terms of

569
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
the political and political,

570
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,360
but also the traditional way of looking at it,

571
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,360
and that's a very important topic

572
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,360
that I would like to talk about for the rest of the presentation.

573
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
I would like to show that this is a very important topic

574
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
and a very important subject.

575
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,360
This is a subject that is very very important

576
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,360
and a very important one as well.

577
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,360
It depends on the person,

578
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,360
but this topic is a very important topic

579
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,360
and it's very important to me.

580
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,360
It's a very important topic

581
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,360
for most of the people that are thinking.

582
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,360
It's a subject that is very very important

583
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,360
for all of us in this discussion,

584
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,360
but it's also important for the people that are thinking

585
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,360
This is actually a topic that I want to see on too,

586
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,360
but still it is a subject that is very very important

587
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,360
and it's very very useful for some people

588
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,360
as well as some people who may like it,

589
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,360
but this is also a subject

590
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,360
that I would like to discuss in the middle only,

591
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
but I think that's a good point.

592
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,360
I would also like to talk about this topic

593
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,360
because I think it's interesting

594
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,360
and I would like to say that something from the beginning

595
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,360
and the way that I think

596
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,360
is very interesting.

597
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,360
This subject is very important

598
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,360
and so from the beginning of the first round,

599
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,360
this is that the background can be a bit more

600
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,360
and that the series is a bit more difficult to make

601
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,360
or as a matter of fact, more difficult to do.

602
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,360
This is a very interesting subject

603
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,360
and I think that's a very important topic

604
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,360
about when you think about a series of projects

605
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,360
that do not seem to do much

606
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,360
and can not be used at all.

607
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
This is also connected to this subject

608
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
and you can't be호�ve

609
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,360
and so it is an interesting topic

610
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,360
but you have to anyway understand

611
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,360
or beenary

612
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,360
or simple in fact

613
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,360
and I would also say that this subject

614
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,360
should not be used on a regular basis

615
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,360
my material is I use something

616
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:38,400
a word and a brochure labeled that only makes a promoting perishable object waste.

617
00:31:38,400 --> 00:32:03,060
the

618
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:07,700
and what is good and can be competitive with entrepreneurs

619
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,140
and play a big role in that.

620
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,260
And so I think that's one of the big things

621
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,860
that's been shown and we've had a lot of opportunities

622
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,700
to do that.

623
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,200
Thank you.

624
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,100
Thank you, sir.

625
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,600

Thank you.

Thank you.

634
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Thank you, sir.

635
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Thank you.

636
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
Thank you, sir.

637
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Thank you, sir.

638
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
Thank you, sir.

639
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
Thank you, sir.

640
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Thank you, sir.
