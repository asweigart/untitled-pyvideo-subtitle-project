00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,300
What worries you?

15

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,180
And I'm sure you'll be very happy.

We are just two sides of the same coin.

28

How do you even do that?

29
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,180
I mean, it's still a magic.

30
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,180
The only other way to know how to do it is to be clear on the magic.

31
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,180
It's better to do it when you can call it.

32
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,180
It's easier to see it in the background.

33
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,180
I mean, it's fine.

34
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,180
I mean, it's not so much a game, but it's you.

35
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,180
Only you have to do it.

36
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,180
It's a game, buddy.

37
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,180
I'll go ahead and ask the staff to go ahead and ask.

38
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,180
I'll go ahead and ask the staff to go ahead and ask.

39
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,180
I'll just tell you how you're going to do it.

40
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,180
So, you're going to say to your own staff,

41
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,180
hey, I'm going to do it.

42
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,180

00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,820
The shopkeeper continued to walk the circumstances

00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,680

The measure began with the timing to feel each other.

94
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,040
I finally rehearsed the

00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,960
I was born in the United States of America

186
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,960
and I was born in the United States of America

187
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,960
and I was born in the United States of America.

188
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,960
I was born in the United States of America

189
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,460
and I met one of my family members

190
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,960
when I was a child, in South閽 tomatoes,

191
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
and he said to me,

192
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,960
you do work a lot, And what do you do for a living?

193
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
I don't touch those things

194
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,960
and nothing of that kind.

195
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,960
The United States of America is practically

196
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,960
the best state in the world

197
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,960
that the United States of America has ever lived.

198
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
My bottom line is

199
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,000
But not to recognize the stag IST� as one in the world,

200
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,180
Saint Catherine from the last century is the future sub humanity.

201
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,200
And this is a beautiful anthropological meeting in eligible

202
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:36,920
Healing authority, and it requires a full conversation

203
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,920
between müslim raise and side...

204
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,220
Without hands and mouth.

205
00:13:45,220 --> 00:14:10,860
Those that I will not Frank about the

206
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,640
There are manyrice найти new opportunities.

207
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:29,180
But the most important thing first is to neat up the

208
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:34,720
improvements of potential enhancements.

209
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
I'm going to be talking about the

210
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
first time I've ever been to a

211
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:26,860
on their own piece of mediums and also the

238
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,700
spent the longest lack of time.

239
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,560
So it was Movie Gear that became Ichiban.

240
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,760
橋を乗せてuyu I lost my friends and country Yeah

243
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,180
Oh by which the

244
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,980
But I was

245
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,460
in the

246
00:16:53,460 --> 00:17:00,300
a

247
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,500
but

248
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,920
enough

249
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,720
Would you stand up as you walk away,

250
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:33,680
the

251
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,340
and

252
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,940
as

253
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:51,920
people

254
00:17:51,920 --> 00:18:21,920
I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,500
lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm

257
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,840

a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm

260
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:52,260
And I think that's the reason why we have to say that we have to be able to do this

261
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,260
and that we have to be able to do this.

262
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:58,260
And I think that's the reason why we have to be able to do this.

263
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,260
And I think that's the reason why we have to be able to do this.

264
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,260
And I think that's the reason why we have to be able to do this.

265
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,260
And I think that's the reason why we have to be able to do this.

266
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,260
And I think that's the reason why we have to be able to do this.

267
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:18,260
I know that as Adam SeudНет Ying and as Debby Buckett said all the time,

268
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,260
the future of the UK is not a continued story in that respect.

269
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,260
And if you really do think of theб this tragedy ン

270
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,340
Kidding!

271
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,260
난neen senon ko enthusiastic

272
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,260
But that name has created a larger role and Lara Say wiping it over time.

273
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,260
I had my son to do my Volda since I was two years old on a street.

274
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,280
But half-'...

275
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,680
Not half-然, further tops the milk coffee.

276
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:32,040
When they want to eat going into the

00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,820
...during one of two special days of Professor Al retired...

00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,820
...at his house at the Peirje View Show...

284
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:01,600
...where he and his wife, about half an hour, did their killer there.

285
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,340
And – it was deleimmering.

286
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,340
The

00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,340
The

288
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,340
The

00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,340
The

00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,340
The

The

00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,340
The

00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,340
The

The

The

The

308
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,340
The

309
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,340
The

310
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,340
The

311
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,340
The

312
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,340
I think that's a great way to do it.

313
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,340
I think that's a great way to do it.

314
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,340
And I think that's a great way to do it.

315
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,340
And I think that's a great way to do it.

And I think that's a great way to do it.

And I think that's a great way to do it.

320
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,340
And I think that's a great way to do it.

321
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,340
So, to conclude by taking on the role of Director for National rearrangement,

322
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,340
is to congratulate the Asian riflemen,

323
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,340
which G你看到的是中國國 tiger,

324
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:59,260
and the M1925

325
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:05,260
It's not a salt Chrome use of private brands, it's not like that.

326
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:24,980
There's some differences about the

00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:32,260
the

00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,260
We are a community of people who are in need of help.

332
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,260
We are a community of people who are in need of help.

333
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:45,260
We are a community of people who are in need of help.

334
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,260
We are a community of people who are in need of help.

335
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,260
We are a community of people who are in need of help.

336
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,260
We are a community of people who are in need of help.

We are a community of people who are in need of help.

338
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,260
We are a community of people who are in need of help.

339
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,260
Now turn around in your chair.

340
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,260
I have raised my eyes.

341
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,260
I没有 older relatively young people,

342
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,580

strides beyond our age of chili elaels.

344
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,280
I think they are more vulnerable to violence in their society.

345
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,260
Many people great to learn to speak in the online

346
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,280
school and social media.

347
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,260
The world is 48 years older

348
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,260
I'm a little bit of a

I'm a little bit of a
