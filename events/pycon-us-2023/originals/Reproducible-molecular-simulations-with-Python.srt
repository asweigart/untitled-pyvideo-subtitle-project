00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,100

We can work together find the possibilities

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,400

but

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:03,960
speeches

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,700
were

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,360
me

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,900
But I'm glad we're able to get the chance to do this.

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,780
As I said, I'm very pleased to be here.

22
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,200
It's a great pleasure to be here.

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,780
It's been a great pleasure.

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,900
It's been a great pleasure.

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,940
So I'm just excited.

26
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,200
It's a great pleasure to be here.

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,940
And I'm proud to say that I'm very happy to be here.

28
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,500
And I'm just proud that the world is beautiful.

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,700
But it's really, really beautiful.

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,700
So I'm pleased that I'm here because I'm very pleased to be

31
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,200
here.

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,060
I'm very pleased now that I'm here because I'm here

33
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,160
to help you.

34
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,000
And I think I'm really excited to be here.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,800
It's been a very fun experience.

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,480
So what we do is we integrate with the scientists.

37
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,840
We find some pieces that we've already discovered.

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,400
One, the other, we've done experience,

39
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,000
especially the other, is very important.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,880
It's been a very exciting experience.

41
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,960
And I'm very pleased to be here.

42
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,200
So that's why I'm so happy to be here.

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,560
That's why I'm so happy to be here.

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,760
And I think that's a great experience.

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,200
So I'm very pleased that I'm here.

46
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,320
That's been a great experience.

47
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,160
It's really exciting to be in this military.

48
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,320
But you know what I mean?

49
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,240
I mean, it's true.

50
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,960
Because you get to play with it.

51
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,600
You get to get out there and play with it.

52
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,760
You're not just playing with it.

53
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,400
You're also getting to play with it.

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,160
So I'm very pleased to be here with this.

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,520
We're all getting to play with it.

56
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,320
We're all getting to play with it.

57
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,080
And that's great.

58
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,240
And it's been a very, very, very good experience.

59
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,400
And I'm glad that it's happening in this country.

60
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,560
It's been a great experience.

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,440
I'm glad that it's happening in this country.

62
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,160
And I'm glad that it's happening in this country.

63
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,760
So last month, we had the news for the first time

64
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,520
that the immigration policy for the United States

65
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,040
was up against the immigration policy.

66
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,800
And the first thing that came to me was the immigration law,

67
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,960
which is a law that is so convincingly

68
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,160
that immigration is a policy that's

69
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,760
in the job market because it's convincingly

70
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,040
it's not just in the job market.

71
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,400
It's in prison.

72
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,000
And that's what I was talking about 15 years ago.

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,760
By the way, this is what I'm calling

74
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,080
the political and political struggle

75
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,680
because this is the worst thing that's

76
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,440
going to happen in the future.

77
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,800
We're getting harder and harder to do.

78
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,600
The immigration is getting harder and harder.

79
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,520
There is a lot of future, but there is no future.

80
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,360
There is no future.

81
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,920
We've been going on throughout the United States.

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,400
Before I just start, I want to say this particular story

83
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,360
that I was talking about, because I want to talk to you about.

84
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,600
The first thing that's constantly happening,

85
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,480
particularly the day that it's constantly happening,

86
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,200
is the way that the data is happening.

87
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,480
The way that the data is happening is that it's just

88
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,040
not in the country.

89
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,400
And so the kind of things that are happening,

90
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,240
especially everything is constantly

91
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,920
happening because of our data.

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,720
So this is a force for me to look at the data

93
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,960
and look at the data.

94
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,080
You know, one of the hardest parts of that fact

95
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,720
is the way that the data is happening.

96
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,720
And I think that's one of the things that is going to be

97
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,760
one point.

98
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,320
Yeah, we're going to bring it back.

99
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,960
Trust me.

100
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,520
Usually, it's not just like data, it's not just like data.

101
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,600
It's like we're going to do something about the data.

102
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,240
The specific data we want to deliver

103
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,480
is the data that we're going to be

104
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,360
like doing in the workplace.

105
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,640
So this is the way that we're going to do it.

106
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,240
We've got to focus on this.

107
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,640
So we're going to do this.

108
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,280
And I think it's much more open data.

109
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,400
I think that the way that we're going to do it

110
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,600
is a little bit more interesting.

111
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,360
And what's interesting, I think, is that it's

112
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,240
not a truly public space.

113
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,560
It's become public space, first of all, that's right.

114
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,960
And more than that, I think that that's

115
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,480
also a big thing, that's very important.

116
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,600
So that makes it just a little bit more

117
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,920
interesting to think about this thing

118
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,840
that we're doing in the workplace.

119
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,080
So it's important for us to do that.

120
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,520
So it's something that's very, very special to us.

121
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,920
And we're going to do this.

122
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,720
We're going to do this in a way that we think

123
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,320
is interesting to us.

124
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,240
I mean, that's what we want to do.

125
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,520
It's probably not something that we want to do.

126
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,080
You know what?

127
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,200
We have done stuff that we're doing.

128
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,440
And we're going to do it.

129
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,960
So we are proud that we're in this community

130
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,760
that started with the pandemic.

131
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:47,140

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,900
in the biome and in the matrix.

186
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,340
And that's what we're going to do,

187
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,140
picture the data of the biome, or the protein

188
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,380
that we're using for the biome.

189
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,980
So part of the question is, what are we

190
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,400
going to use to model the proteins?

191
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,940
Now, to the economics of this, we are trying to do this

192
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,800
better.

193
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,640
And we can say, this is much more straightforward.

194
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,340
But it is a method that lets us use

195
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,520
that first-person view that is the one that

196
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,960
is the main goal of the choice.

197
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,320
So this is what I call the first-person view,

198
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,120
the actual question.

199
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,960
You can see it's not over how interesting it is to work.

200
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,120
This is really, really complicated.

201
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,560
This was the answer to what we had been asked to focus

202
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,640
on in a specific study.

203
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,520
But in fact, the whole data that is there

204
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,520
has been possible from the answer that we

205
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,760
have to focus on the most acceptable

206
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,800
and the most acceptable problem in the spectrum.

207
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,240
So yeah, proteins are very, very complex.

208
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,360
We have them.

209
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,260
And we need to develop the formation

210
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,860
of the structure of the protein group

211
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,860
in order to achieve different proteins

212
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,020
and different types of proteins and things like that.

213
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,900
So this is previously what was the approach

214
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,060
to this particular study.

215
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,540
Can you see it?

216
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,460
No, that's it.

217
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,140
That's it.

218
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,580
That's the answer.

219
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,300
That's the answer.

220
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,820
So what's this thing, in the middle of that?

221
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,800
Is it three steps?

222
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,380
The first step is to come up to the wander gang

223
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,240
and see what happens to the protein group

224
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,920
and what happens to the studies' flow.

225
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,600
So it's the onboarding, the overall Verein burgers

226
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,140
for proteins, proteins, proteins, proteins, proteins,

227
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,760
proteins and things like that.

228
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,220
And the second step is to develop a protein sequence

229
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,960
and statuette to make the structure

230
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,080
the structure of the functions.

231
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,600
So without models, that could actually

232
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,880
fit into the structure.

233
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,440
But now this structure that is in the kind of body

234
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,280
that you're going to try to use is very nice.

235
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,320
So now we have the engine, the motor,

236
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,040
the engine, the equipment, the engine,

237
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,440
the external system.

238
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,880
So there is definitely a lot of new stuff

239
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,880
coming into the engine.

240
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,920
And also as a result, the output that we can use,

241
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,920
we have a very high-level of the engine.

242
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,580
Because as I said, nobody feels very propping up

243
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,220
for something you never plan.

244
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,940
So add something that is big enough

245
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:29,260
to build some really big torque takeaway

246
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:35,340
that when this city

247
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,800
is in its computer死

248
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,060
while it drives it to do something.

249
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,000
So we have pretty advanced sees its apples that

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,720
it has in its me.

251
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
and I think that overall, the

252
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
difference is very, like,

253
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
diversity to the particular

254
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
sectors.

255
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
So it's not that plagiarism is

256
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
very much part of the

257
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
common sense, right? It's the

258
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
fact that if you put mention of

259
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
the things that we do, we're

260
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
not actually the things that

261
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
we're interested in, to

262
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
probably be complicated

263
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
and sometimes it's the

264
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
things that we do, but we

265
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
actually have access to things that we

266
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
have, and then so it's

267
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
like that, and so we walk out

268
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
and we say, well, we're going to take a picture, right?

269
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
But it's not a positive

270
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
or a negative, it's

271
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,720
we have

272
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
we have the access to

273
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
real, real, real ideas

274
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
and we have real, real solutions to

275
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
structures in this area

276
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
that actually gives to the

277
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
problem, so we're not going to go

278
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
over this part of the mention of

279
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
the things that we do, but we actually have the

280
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
things that we do, but we actually have the

281
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,720
access to real, real, real ideas.

282
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
So it's a big time point in

283
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
need for all these

284
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
things to go public, right? It's time

285
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
to go public, right? It's time to

286
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
start the journey once we get

287
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
to the design of this

288
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
very important and technical

289
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,720
solution, how is the time of

290
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
planning of these tasks really

291
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
important? One thing is

292
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
this thing called the things from

293
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
video我們自身想走,

294
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
happens to map the video,

295
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,720
in any other

296
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
solution, in the

297
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
same way that

298
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,720
everyone else that

299
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
brings the team of

300
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:36,720
foresight on

301
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,020
because that's the only way to do that.

302
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,020
If there's any more�도ρ ever talked about.

303
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,720
For example, about the empty custom

304
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,160
that Frans Lentz did in Bruno,

305
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,520
in görünest name,

306
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
you add a full window

307
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
and then you show people

308
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:48,860
what Paulo V designed

309
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and it's like that.

310
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,000
And the new�הpt them

311
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,160
is called Cad Delhi for whatever project,

312
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,820
because con 중요aЯ

313
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,660
Achille 옆de Fag immersion

314
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,720
the tropic thingru

315
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,800
And that's why we have the ability to do that.

316
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,320
So we have these labs.

317
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,440
It's called the team lab.

318
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
We can call it the team lab.

319
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,560
They call it the team lab.

320
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,680
So it's a very successful team.

321
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,760
So now that we have this very, very successful team,

322
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,240
what do we make the use of?

323
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,640
So people have a very powerful team

324
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,120
that work with us at this point.

325
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,560
We have a dynamic team.

326
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,240
So let's say people are using this.

327
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,400
They have this program that they're

328
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,680
going to have to construct a new team.

329
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,920
They are in the middle.

330
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,880
And this is what we're going to do.

331
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,120
But it's just part of the community.

332
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,960
It hasn't come from the production line.

333
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,600
Of course, we could have used one of these programs

334
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,080
to make the dimension.

335
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,640
But it does have a very powerful team.

336
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,040
And we can just put the reactionary

337
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,120
to use the strategic team.

338
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,560
What we saw before was that it was being used

339
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,600
in the field.

340
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,120
It was a very powerful team.

341
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,760
And we were able to build a team that was very powerful.

342
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,720
So I think we got two of the best teams.

343
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,520
Five percent, six percent, seven percent.

344
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,760
Between that and all of these teams,

345
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,040
we have about 15% of the teams.

346
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,280
So we used that as a question.

347
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,960
But each of the teams, I think, started to think about

348
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,040
how the team was going to be used.

349
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,680
It was more of an organization.

350
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,080
I think it was a very important team.

351
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,600
They were concerned with the competition.

352
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,840
But we also had more of a team that was

353
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,960
going to be by our side than we wanted to have.

354
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,400
And that is that it's good.

355
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,160
I think it's a good team.

356
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,480
So one of the key things that we're

357
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,920
going to do to bring the team to this stage,

358
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,440
because we're only thinking in terms of the great statistics,

359
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,800
is to incorporate what's in the management.

360
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,280
Not the marketing, but the design of the team.

361
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,760
So it is very small.

362
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,160
And of course, quite important.

363
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,840
But it's a nice little scale.

364
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,120
So what we're doing is we're taking a course period.

365
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,000
And we do a course period that we don't want to take

366
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,160
into account.

367
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,120
And so I think the rest, I think,

368
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,800
I'm not going to start that much longer.

369
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,520
But I think what we need to do is

370
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,640
we need to focus not just on the specific points,

371
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,320
but on the quality of the management

372
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,120
and the statistics in these course periods.

373
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,280
And we need to focus on the quality of the management.

374
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,400
And this is how we're going to do the important things.

375
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,480
But the quality of that work is sort of the best of the best.

376
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,080
It's the right community to go to.

377
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,800
And that's what I think is important.

378
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,120
So I think that's really important.

379
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,400
So that is not good.

380
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,080
It's really about quality.

381
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,720
So we need to repair quality.

382
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,880
That's what I think.

383
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,480
So that's what we need to do.

384
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,280
This is the second thing I want to talk about.

385
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,000
So what do we do as a course period to do it?

386
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,080
We use the third thing, which is about the fact

387
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,120
that there's not a lot of time in this for this to get

388
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,400
this time to pass.

389
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
There's a lot of time to get to work.

390
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,200
And we do some of the stuff that we're doing.

391
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,680
So we use the third thing.

392
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,320
And I think that's probably what we

393
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,040
would have to focus on is the quality of the management

394
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,520
and the statistics in these course periods.

395
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,880
So that's what we're going to focus on.

396
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,080
So that's the third thing.

397
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,800
And that's what I think is important.

398
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,320
Some of the rules of these files are very important.

399
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,880
So let's think of a course period for the development

400
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,800
of these files.

401
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,200
So we can go back to the fact that we

402
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,480
have these files from X number 5, as a child's

403
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,760
and a five-year-old.

404
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,840
So we are going to have to imagine part of the process

405
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,560
for this to be just the most successful course period

406
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,760
for this course period.

407
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,000
So what we're going to do is we're going to have to do this

408
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,360
and we could do is find a standard format.

409
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,360
So we're going to have to do the pre-file

410
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,120
and start the writing.

411
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,600
You have to start with the pre-file.

412
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,960
So that's the first thing.

413
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,400
Even then, we can actually do is just find a format

414
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,840
that we actually need to do.

415
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,640
So we're going to have to do this by way of the pre-file

416
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,360
for this program.

417
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,840
So this is not just this pre-file.

418
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,600
It's pre-file.

419
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,960
But that's a kind of a feature to the pre-file.

420
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,640
So once we have found with write,

421
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,960
it's not as great.

422
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,400
That doesn't make any sense.

423
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,400
So I'm going to go from here to here about some images.

424
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,200
We're going to take some of these images.

425
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,720
It's just the idea of some image production

426
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,760
and write and actually do some of it.

427
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,560
So as before, it was easy to do.

428
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,360
Now, the special reason I said so is

429
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,920
that many of you took the image processing

430
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,040
and put it in the instance of the file.

431
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,080
You can put the box in and do the image processing again.

432
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,480
So that's the way we're doing it.

433
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,640
So we're doing this even in further.

434
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,040
So we're doing the post-file.

435
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,320
We are just starting to find something

436
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,920
basically un-muted, but it's just like some virtual

437
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,760
expression of a movie.

438
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,200
And it starts with a question, so it's not a problem.

439
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,360
I want to give this a little bit of a sense

440
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,160
that by the fact that here, for example,

441
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,120
there'sart because printing is purely to Okay,

442
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,640
so this gives you thenyard of how it's � 5Ar,

443
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,500
so the process society might just probably

444
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,960
will be when you actors in such fact

445
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,480
self- promotional project.

446
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,240
But you have to incidentally experience

447
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,800
the action that you just saw.

448
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,000
Especially in the way that what it's

449
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,440
mentioning just now is that it's not

450
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,740
always the time and the place for oneNickkel

451
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,580
or F блок is a bit different here in tolerant of populations.

452
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,440
So we have types Gustavs and dere narines

453
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,120
that's the dream of the people of the United States of America.

454
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,240
So things like me, I've got my time-lapse of time-lapses,

455
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,160
time-lapses, time-lapses that the public is using,

456
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,040
but is also a time-lapse.

457
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,280
So I think that's the dream.

458
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,120
That's a dream.

459
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,800
So I'm going to select two groups of society celebrities,

460
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,800
and then we create the fundamentalists,

461
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,720
the fundamentalists, and the fundamentalists.

462
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,600
The fundamentalists is based on the fact that we do

463
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,880
have the public opinion, so China appears in that group.

464
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,720
We actually see that the expense of the work

465
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,720
of the fundamentalists takes on the public opinion.

466
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,840
So this is the thing that is the central to the business.

467
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,120
What we look like in the field of the great African leaders

468
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,800
and the human experience is that it's tried to then

469
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,960
be used in the actual sense.

470
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,280
And then it's still focused on the fact

471
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,680
that it is a very topical study.

472
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,760
It's not going to be an excellent product.

473
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,800
It's not going to be a good thing.

474
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,760
But it's not going to be as good as it was supposed to be.

475
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,760
And it's still about the use of the public machine

476
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,160
that we have in the great state.

477
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,280
And we create a model of how we can create

478
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,760
an effective work that is not going to be

479
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,400
a product of the expense of that business.

480
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,360
This is the thing that we have seen as a product.

481
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,120
We have seen the things that are ready,

482
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,080
how they're going to be effective.

483
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,560
So we have that kind of thing, and we're

484
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,720
going to be making a lot of this stuff

485
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
for the future of our society.

486
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,520
So I'd like to note that for this reason,

487
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,680
we have these four main steps.

488
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,200
Relying on the number of the states,

489
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,000
there is a number of rigid components

490
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,440
for the people to express.

491
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,040
So we have to manually change the size of the design

492
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,160
companies that use that in the future, which is a number two.

493
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,920
So the workers can go to reproduce

494
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,200
in this case, they're able to do it in a few years.

495
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,600
So we need to make the best of it.

496
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,560
But as I know, for example, there are

497
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,680
things that are more important than that.

498
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,040
It's too much.

499
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,680
It's too much.

500
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,240
There are things that are more important than that.

501
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,080
So this is where we work on the challenges.

502
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,240
Then why would all the things that are important

503
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,320
objects that you can't change in real time,

504
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,680
why would you want them to be from the world?

505
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,040
So you see, it's very important that you can

506
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,600
make sure that the problems that you have

507
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,120
are not the problems that are around the time that you do this.

508
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,960
So there are a lot of different ways

509
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,880
that there's not too many problems.

510
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,400
Of course, we need to start experimentation

511
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,960
because you have methods that are

512
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,720
far more robust in connection still with the markets.

513
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,600
So I think there's a lot of different ways to do that.

514
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,400
Modify these objects to be a task

515
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,280
because you have to find new directions.

516
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,880
If you modify code, then it's probably

517
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,920
taking real time in real time.

518
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,760
So that's essentially what you're

519
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,600
supposed to do, which is to start to specialize in.

520
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,040
So this is one of the many problems

521
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,800
that we talk about from a week.

522
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,760
That's also if the data comes in,

523
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,480
it's a two-year-old's dynamic.

524
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,960
So it can be that everything is structured by the facts

525
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,600
if you want to put this thing in.

526
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,680
By now, we're not talking about the things

527
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,400
we do for this type of ecosystem.

528
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,200
Part of it is that I do all the things

529
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,080
together to deal with that this thing is moving.

530
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,640
But everything else that's happening

531
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,440
is happening, especially the most related structure.

532
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,080
So we have to go in and fix the problem

533
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,840
in the other segments, frameworks, and elaborates

534
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,720
that we have to deal with.

535
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,520
Once we've got it, we will make much more different models

536
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,320
of the big and big problems.

537
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,120
So we have to fix some of the different problems that we have.

538
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,160
We have to do the algorithmic problems

539
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,120
separately for this problem, which basically

540
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,560
creates a section for how we're going to come together

541
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,040
as a case-by-case analysis to exploit the fact that we

542
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,120
have to extract these frameworks within a few weeks

543
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,360
to get our code and distribute this code

544
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,920
by the state of California to the United

545
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,840
that we just first did.

546
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,200
That you have to write to the defense

547
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,000
and you have to write these proportions first

548
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,520
to each of the different types.

549
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,960
And this will bring the limitation

550
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,960
that it's not a big problem.

551
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,200
So it's one of the models that we're really first on.

552
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,440
So these are the ones that are going to get that accelerated

553
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,520
step-by-step to the original rules, which

554
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,560
are the original values that this engagement process

555
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,280
is going to be.

556
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,320
And we have to think about it.

557
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
It doesn't get forced to it.

558
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,320
We have to think about it.

559
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,280
This is one of the things that's really important.

560
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,920
We have to optimize for that specific problem

561
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,560
that we're going to get.

562
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,040
So that they're going to be in the right direction.

563
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,880
So that's part of the whole thing.

564
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,720
So I think that's the whole thing.

565
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,320
And I think how to do this is there are some dynamics.

566
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,960
And so what it says to do is you have to ask the problem,

567
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,320
and you have to go to the model, and you

568
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,920
have to ask the problem.

569
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
So you have to go to the model.

570
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,440
Basically, you have to go to the model,

571
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,720
and you have to use the geometry to create a model.

572
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,360
And I think that's the thing that then you

573
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,320
have to speak about, speak about the other spectrum.

574
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,640
So if you are a react, the problem,

575
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,360
it's an advanced response problem.

576
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,200
If you are a place, it's a problem.

577
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,800
If it's an advanced problem, I would

578
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,360
say part of making this a very important aspect.

579
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,000
It's a very significant factor to focus on.

580
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,600
So I think we're going to be able to do this for this instance

581
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,120
by replacing the other things.

582
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,320
So I would ask you to speak about this.

583
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,080
It's a very important aspect to focus on.

584
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,160
So as I said, there are other applications.

585
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,680
So I guess I'll now begin to talk to you

586
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,400
about in general, how you can fix this model.

587
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,240
So I'll start with the first one.

588
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,920
But in general, I think that the system

589
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
is not a good system.

590
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:00,120
And so my thing then, in other words,

591
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,680
is as the policy is, we have to have

592
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,360
different facilities other than that of the framework.

593
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,920
Yeah, so we can see the model picture.

594
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,800
And we're using the framework for the table.

595
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,480
And the biggest distinction that we have is the sense curve.

596
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,040
So if you have a very solid curve,

597
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,440
you're going to have to do some extremely good things

598
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,400
to get the sense curve.

599
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,840
The second thing is to get into revenue.

600
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,480
That might have been something prayed

601
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,240
for on the tourist industry.

602
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,920
It's very simple formula, but the point

603
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:52,020
is that even if unreliable

604
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,980
So we have to get a couple people in this model.

605
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,580
You've got to know the model and you've

606
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,020
got to ask the first person who's using the model

607
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,300
to tell what kind of methods this thing for them

608
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
helps them in the first place.

609
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,500
And there's a lot of points you have to consider

610
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,820
when you're making this kind of stuff.

611
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,140
So yeah, so it was a very useful piece of information

612
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,100
that I could help you take in.

613
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,500
Yeah, we really think that it was a cool thing.

614
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,700
And now that we've got this ready,

615
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,820
we've got a lot of methods that we can use.

616
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,740
When you graphite this, the smallest and so on,

617
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:33,420
you can see that there is a lot of stuff where

618
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,540
you can use some of the science and the other things

619
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,460
that you can use for that.

620
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,740
That's really helpful for so far the people

621
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,100
to work with to make these things work.

622
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,100
And then you can use them to make it so that they're

623
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,020
ка sudden again.

624
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,540
And what's important is to understand

625
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,980
how it's going to work in a certain way.

626
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,520
How exactly do they work at the time

627
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,220
for using胡mi estoy.

628
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,260
It's a really important aspect that it removes.

629
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:08,540
It leaves up every sense of responsibility.

630
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,200
So in this case for example, I've

631
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,280
been thinking about unregulated approach

632
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,900
as the argument between some of the people

633
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,940
who need mutual respect in Schweiz.

634
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:42,780
final scoresOoh.

635
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,320
is not important.

636
00:27:44,340 --> 00:28:07,620
Other

637
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:12,620
One thing that we use to get better at doing these things

638
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,620
is we use the tools that are available that we're using

639
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,620
to get better at communication.

640
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:22,620
So all kinds of tools, there are more tools outside of the experts

641
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,620
that help us to experience things.

642
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,620
There's some already know about this work that I think

643
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,620
is difficult to do, so that would be specifically to get

644
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,620
the users to like what they're doing, but we don't want to

645
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,620
put them through a lot of experience and experience

646
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,620
experience and experience with everything that we do.

647
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,620
So that's a good question.

648
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,620
That's a good question.

649
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,620
That's a good question.

650
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,620
We have a lot of stuff that we use.

651
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,620
I think we have a lot of things that we're not, we have,

652
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,620
we need to make a real life experience.

653
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,620
And that's what we have.

654
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,620
We have a framework that is practices that we use.

655
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,620
And that's pretty cool.

656
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,620
And it does look like we need to, all we need to do is

657
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:16,820
even value the

658
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,360
be decided.

659
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:36,500
But basically, the darkness from the

660
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,340
that maybe we could accumulate and expand

661
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,280
this extra time thinking about the loop,

662
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:46,640
where we can learn the same last

663
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,820
few years after these bendels

664
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,580
in their previous waste cat broke down.

665
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,580
We like that 맹pler.

666
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:50,900
In these case,

667
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,960
at the same time that we're talking about,

668
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,580
I thought we'd come as occasionally

669
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,880
as fast as we can get to the end.

670
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,220
I also fragrance easy way to

671
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,080
use Painting in these chamois

672
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,880
because we're using the

673
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,740
needed place often at appreciate

674
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,420
the previous?...

675
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,140
yet again but you're going.

676
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,640
For those of you that don't know what

677
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,240
to have a certain number of people

678
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,880
who use that word specific to this,

679
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,840
or it's a different word than the one that you want to use.

680
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,240
But you already took to this all,

681
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,080
you took to this.

682
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,080
So we're gonna do this,

683
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,480
I have a few approaches asking this,

684
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,080
trying to model something in the data,

685
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,720
where it's something that's out there,

686
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,080
and it's pretty fair that we're gonna

687
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,240
have a few approaches to find out.

688
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,680
It's very, very helpful,

689
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,840
and we're talking about some of the spaces

690
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,680
that we're gonna take,

691
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,440
but I'm gonna leave it there for the questions.
