00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
because I'm so sorry to say that.

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840

Like that to be honest

40
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,600
we see that the

in terms of babies.

51
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,860
Mr. B endured its experiences

52
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,100
more than it could.

53
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,500
His idea of death is a good one

54
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,980
because phase stage suicide's 18 weeks.

55
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,620
And I think this is going understand

56
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,420
that there must be ...

57
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,940
The bigger problem is that I think

58
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,280
some people who are experiencing it

59
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,300

and the government of the world.

64
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,360
And I think that the

65
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
government of the world

66
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
can expand its influence

67
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,860
in the next few years.

68
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,860
So, I think that we should start

69
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,860
with the fact that

70
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,860
we should start

71
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,860
with the fact that

72
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,860
we should start

73
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,860
with the fact that

74
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,860
we should start

75
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,860
with the fact that

76
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,860
we should start

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,860
with the fact that

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,860
we should start

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,860

they are now following the same

119
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,900
And I believe is the very reason I believe in the technology

120
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,960
because it becomes a social threat even I wanna keep my home

121
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,860
because I think the most roz0000000 and I really think the most

We are very proud of ourselves.

and to be able to present ourselves in a way that is not funny.

125
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,860
And so it is a great honor for us to be here today

126
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,860
and to be able to speak on this event.

127

And so we are very happy to be here today

128
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:56,860
and to be able to present ourselves in a way that is not funny.

129
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,860
First, I think that this is a great thing,

130
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:20,580
In fact, in this event we Government

131
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,860

they could我也 take

00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,200
the numbers

139
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,760
instead of

00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,500
spending

141
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
a lot time with

and seeing

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,440
all that

146
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:37,940
and telling

154
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,140

157
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:45,940
what

158
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,700
we know

159
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,040
significantly

160
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:52,640
It's

161
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,240
isn't

162
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,560

rainforest

164
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,340
And it's a very big area, and I think that's a good example of that.

165
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:04,340
So this is a great example of some of the best things that we can do at the street fair.

166
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:10,340
This is a very big area, and I think that's a good example of some of the best things that we can do at the street fair.

167
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:17,340
To provide more help at the street fair, and we're going to be doing this for a long time.

168
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,340
to provide more help at the street fair, and we're going to be doing this for a long time.

169
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:31,340
We are going to be doing this for a long time.

170
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:55,120
fundamental as developers and the

171
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,420
First of all, I would like to say a shout out to the board of directors,

172
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,860
mural jouissance,

173
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,080
and, of course, to students,

174
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,780
colleagues who have done these things for us.

175
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,720
The folks at interwede for TONER

176
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,960
who helped to create Quaker nursing space

177
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,260
and妹like speculate in this,

178
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,460
these folks,

179
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,880
you know how we should be punishing them.

180
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,680
I'm just red- demonstrated that

This is 삈 knights and angst.

184
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,860
This is a big style, I saw it a few times.

185
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,880
It's a bit of a military, not aHelp but for it's troops,

186
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,540
and a 바�ée that this **COVID19**

187
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,660
are doing to pull together to fight in this game.

188
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,340
We also have to see how the 50% income

189
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,860
and passing are not normal.

190
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,440
We just necesita be aware that this figured

191
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,440
And I was actually very, very, very aware of what people were asking me to do.

192
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,440
So I was very happy to see that this is an option.

193
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,440
And I was very excited about the idea of the new show and the best way.

194
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,440
And I was very excited to see the show and the service that they've given us.

195
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,440
And this is a lot of dollars right now.

196
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,440
So I'm very excited about the success of the program.

197
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,440
And I think this is a very important thing.

198
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,440
I think that the program is a very important one because we have to get the job done.

199
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,440
We have to get the job done and be able to benefit.

200
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,440
So I'm so happy that we have the opportunity to work with the program.

201
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
And I think that the program is very good.

202
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,440
I feel like we can do a lot more.

203
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,440
I think that we can really make a difference.

204
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,440
I think that we can make a difference in the whole of our system.

205
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
Thank you very much, Steve!

206
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Thank you, Tim.

207
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
I want to take you back to that.

208
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,440
So you mentioned that the business was pretty near the bottom of the sheet,

209
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
so you could have written something that would have been buffalo that we've seen.

210
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
But again, I hope, we heart would have been in luck in returning it.

211
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,440
And I want to stay stronger in Caesar and to provide this experience with more more

212
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,440
social work so that people are interested in it.

213
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,440
But let's not sit back and wait.

214
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,660
because she is an nevertheless quite solution.

215
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,040
So,タン слライボ内 blog,

216
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,540
Pリスヴィアラスラウ待プラ Kan Spencer,

217
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,040
which name is actually it's a very beautiful name

218
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,520
but very short and very interesting name

219
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,100
so I will write it off.

220
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,380
Pautott Wrestleuis is known

221
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,940
who had before been given

222
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,980
some IVM expert at the time.

223
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,300
She takes those medical recipes

224
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,680
and they are in a lot of context

225
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,520
There's still room for though.

226
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,060
field expense everywhere very little in my memory.

227
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,760
For now of course not for the relevant pace of special offer

228
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,300
because these in my schools,

229
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,760
if you go ahead and pay dollars collection,

230
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,040
and not just in that percentage mortgages biosecond

231
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,000
because if we were to have that which knew

232
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,480
the earth will nights over and on restible,

233
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,640
in parts of the size of 2000,

234
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:37,100
if the

235
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,720
has to get them out.

236
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,320
And fingers crossed we theatre

237
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,560
would take in the impacts harder to

238
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,060
do AND if it were a

239
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,340
cake out of the booklet.

240
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,700
And

241
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:59,940
hands on the

242
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,920
right direction.

243
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,820
Hands on the right direction.

244
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,040
And you can see Oneız

245
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,020
hands on the right direction.

246
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,340
and you can see Oneiz

247
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,820
to help you discover

248
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:05,900
to help you discover

249
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,900
not just in the United States,

250
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,700
but in the United States and the United States.

251
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,400
So this is a terrible situation

252
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,800
that has become so difficult

253
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,900
and difficult to face in the United States

254
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,300
by the social and economic system.

255
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,100
And we find this so difficult and difficult

256
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,700
because the government,

257
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,500
the government is so successful in this.

258
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,600
The social and economic system

259
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,400
is so bad that it's difficult

260
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,600
to get this in the United States.

261
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,400
And that's why we can't really

262
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,900
get this in the United States

263
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,400
without us having these doctors

264
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,700
and their bullshit

265
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,800
and if we get this in the United States,

266
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,300
we're going to be so much more

267
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,200
and much more very successful.

268
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,000
This is so sad.

269
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,400
And so sad that we can't get this

270
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,500
with the government and social and economic system

271
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,500
and so bad that it's so difficult

272
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,600
and so hard to get this in the United States.

273
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,100
And it's terrible.

274
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,200
It's so difficult to get this

275
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,500
with the government and the social and economic system

276
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,100
and so bad that it's so difficult

277
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,600
to get this in the United States.

278
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,100
And so we have to ask,

279
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,100
and this is a very, very specific

280
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,700
and very serious and very difficult question,

281
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,300
but people are certainly better

282
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,900
than people in the United States.

283
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,400
And personally, I think that

284
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,800
the government should be very careful

285
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,500
because certainly it's a very, very bad

286
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,100
and very serious and very difficult question.

287
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,300
And also, I think that

288
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,000
this is a very, very specific question

289
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,800
because certainly the government does

290
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,200
very well and very well

291
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,800
what they are to try to do

292
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,500
to make sure that the government

293
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,000
is very careful to get this done

294
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,200
and that the government runs

295
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,900
very carefully and carefully

296
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,600
and this is very important.

297
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,400
And I think that the government

298
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,700
should be very careful

299
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,900
and very good at what they are doing

300
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,800
to get this done and very good.

301
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,000
And also, I think that the government

302
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,800
should be very careful

303
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,600
and very careful

304
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,200
and try to make sure that the system

305
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,300
is very, very, very specific

306
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,400
and very consistent

307
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,800
and very, very, very accurate.

308
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,600
And if we try to make sure

309
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,700
that the government is very careful

310
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,900
and very good,

311
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,900
certainly the government

312
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,900
should be very, very, very good

313
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,900
and certainly not too difficult

314
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,900
and not too hard.

315
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,900
Next, I'd like to talk about this.

316
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,700
I have a sophisticated idea

317
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,700
that the government should be very, very careful

318
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,400
in terms of the person who is saying

319
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,700
this is a person who is saying

320
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,000
that we are all very, very, very good.

321
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,300
And this is a very, very specific question

322
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,300
about the situation with

323
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,800
certain people in question and other things.

324
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,100
This is totally the best example

325
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,900
of doing it in a certain way.

326
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,900
I felt that the community

327
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,700
is very good and is very good at this.

328
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,700
And I think that the system

329
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,500
is very good at all of the special things

330
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,000
that we do work with.

331
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,100
And this is the kind of

332
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,000
very specific idea

333
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,300
that the government has

334
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,200
especially in terms of experience and knowledge.

335
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,700
And we have a very different community

336
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,900
where we take a different approach

337
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,100
in a different way to some of the work

338
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,700
that the government does

339
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,200
and define as very, very different

340
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,300
in terms of what we see in our

341
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,700
political and political discourse.

342
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,900
And if we ask this

343
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,400
and we ask them to have a very specific

344
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,100
and specific idea

345
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
that the system is very good

346
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,300
and is very good at having a manager

347
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,360
in charge of their agencies for certain

348
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,900
things and perspectives

349
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,200
which are perhaps significant

350
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,900
to the problems

351
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
with amounts of locks-down

352
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,600
where they would hold the sticks

353
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,800
as whenever the cosmetic company

354
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,700
would do a certain testing

355
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,300
to keep them within control

356
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
during a disconnection

357
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,300
and leave some room for pre-dこんにちは

358
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,500
this would be quick and hard

359
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:46,420
and professional removed from

360
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,260
Do us God owe your son and all that he did me

361
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,220
but take all the salmon

362
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,600
and dip it in Mike bracket

363
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,760
and load it.

364
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,800
It is necessary by serving through the last six years

365
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,820
and with God's help

366
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,800
et cetera,

367
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,680
that the powers of fortification

368
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,680
which we fear don't.

369
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,120
It isicity ituld ofCCI

370
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,520
When I've been through this or put on the mod and stopped it, I feel like I've been

371
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,180
in it since I wasVerlessness to the infer cheesecake.

372
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,500
And it endowed, being in Ireland through hardly anything since the films, the visuals were

373
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:04,060
society which had 개ERO at the time, it forgiven, it please the people.

374
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:10,900

focused input..

379

And we hut it all together.

386
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,620
It went a lot.

387
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,580
That's the lyrics at the bottom.

388
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,560
So, it changed in a lot.

389
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,880
It was very emotional lyrics,

390
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,960

391
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,620

392
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,920
it feels very emotional.

393
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,040
And it was,

394
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,060
you know,

395
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,000
in the beginning,

396
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,840
I said that,

397
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,040
it was so emotional

398
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,880
and, of course,

399
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,900
it felt an incredible,

400
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,720
so,

401
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,620
that if the team doesn't assume this way of electronic training today and still these

Hello,

00:20:52,320 --> 00:21:07,300
I see like

412
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,200
and we are now able to appreciate,

413
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,960
and I hope you pay this special respect

414
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,900
to this amazing receptionist,

415
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:26,920
the

416
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,860
sesiq !

417
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:37,860
that she can get the galaxies not all known but just a bit of a deeper knowledge

418
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:43,040
that a this these these edges of the storm

419
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,900
sounds very much create for what I can say

420
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:59,540
that all of this is that so city for a

421
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:05,540
And the first thing is that we have to be aware of the potential for the future of the

422
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:11,540
world, the value of the abilities, which is to be aware of the potential for the future

423
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,540
of the people we're all fighting.

424
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,540
And we have to be aware of the potential for the world.

425
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,540
So, we have to be aware of the values that we have.

426
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,540
And we have to be aware of the values that we have.

427
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,540
And we have to be aware of the values that we have.

428
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,540
And taking the traditional leadership CARE program, we want to encourage it.

429
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,760
And universities should also have carved out their own

430
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,760
unique rules or traditional rules.

431
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,540
And, you know, it just shows in this event that ouraleures

432
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:44,540
is designed to compete for the world, and you know by that this is…

433
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:49,020
is it our mission to be as the most aggressionous and most violent

434
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:54,020
1982 school is a place where we are to Molly Pickering,

435
00:22:54,020 --> 00:23:09,260
It's a

436
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:16,260
and we are confident in that and we are confident in this kind of knowledge and the campaign

437
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,260
that we have for the world.

438
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:25,260
So, this is the discovery that is being made by the state, by the state of the United States

439
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:33,260
and by the state of the United States, and by the state of the United States.

440
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,660
So, you see that we have future wars and there is a great beer coming soon,

441
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,660
with a huge-sh expansive drink shop because many people there usually eat the nothing drink.

442
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:50,660
And we have a Kirchnerk可以m and it is possible we will get the unique history and masks

443
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,660
for the color religions people have taken pictures on, when they got married

444
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,660
and we are about oneatted and it is very difficult to set it,

445
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,380
So this advice is expected, and...

446
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,380
and...

447
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,040
the first device

448
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,740
to select a assigned apology

449
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,880
compared to what I did before

450
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,020
is trying to fully exhaust

451
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,800
and deploy the retrouve

452
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,200
for a certain benefit

453
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,620
exactly what I have suffers

454
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,440
during this

455
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,180
irritation

456
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,360
and going through it

457
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,580
for a long time.

458
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,900
And I just want to point out

459
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,820
that I felt

460
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,700
We don't have to put all the things together.

461
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,700
We can do it.

462
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,420
We have to.

463
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,380
We have to.

464
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,500
We have to see that there isn't.

465
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,140
So before, it's important.

466
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,580
We have to see that there isn't a whole lot

467
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,300
of different things that we can do.

468
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,060
So we have to do it.

469
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,580
We have to create a house.

470
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,580
We have to create a house.

471
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,020
We have to create a city.

472
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,660
We have to create this city.

473
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,620
And we have to create a city.

474
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,380
I can't wait to see what it's like.

475
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,420
This is the last time I'm doing that.

476
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,940
So hopefully, it'll be a cool bit.

477
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,020
And I think that this is the last time

478
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,660
that I'm going to be doing this.

479
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,660
And I also want to say this,

480
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,140
because I think that this is the last time

481
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,380
that I'm doing this.

482
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,220
I think that this is the last time

483
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,540
that I'm going to be doing this.

484
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,460
The final part I think is going to be

485
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,780
coming with the part that,

486
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,140
because the idea of the first attempt

487
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,740
in the building,

488
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,580
and the idea of the first attempt

489
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,260
in the building,

490
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,740
and the idea of the first attempt

491
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,340
in the building,

492
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,180
because it's not the kind of building

493
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,820
that I'm going to be doing.

494
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,100
And so I'm going to be trying to say,

495
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,460
because the mostorious thing

496
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,540
where I wouldn't say this,

497
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,260
nowadays of the eco- seriously,

498
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,180
would be looking at high- Honeyeng Xing 무�n travel visit,

499
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,700
so it's not going to be my first time again.

500
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,140
So to speak up,

501
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,780
what's going to be doing is trying

502
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,780
to include

503
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,180
a set

504
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,920
of existing

505
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,860
the Eties joining the

506
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,020
pyramid

507
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,460
twenty five or twenty western ones even.

508
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,980
So, what we can afford is

509
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,740
in the market now and the target

510
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,240
now, we can hacerlo

511
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,860
following up steps

512
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,840
during a pandemic

513
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,840
during an economic period

514
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,060
For example, you are now

515
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,980
theLuice follows up

516
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,820
self work

517
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,180
and with you it's a

518
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:47,760
lock'ná do

519
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,380
we open again

520
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,560
On some, he might even get getting old,

521
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,560
How it's little, he yet to get old.

522
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,140
because, as I said,

523
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,840
Also, the box or just this,

524
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,160
The card or this,

525
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,500
is that as it is old and old.

526
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,340
I'll go back to the picture.

527
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,180
Just in preliminary,

528
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,840
I could have healthy The box or just this,

529
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,920
like the Rveis and I just trust

530
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:27,440
Specifically, that they don't have to wait until Christmasore that they drink or drink

531
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:35,440
alcohol when they can, and, frankly, I think that that's probably a very good euphonium

532
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,240
for people with disabilities.

533
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:43,100
And I would sometimesier if I were, if I were to say, I'mственно wasted, and I would

534
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,100
from that government in the U.S. New York issue.

535
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,100
And this service, this service, this service is a service

536
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,100
that is created by the individual citizens,

537
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,100
by the people of the United States, the American citizens,

538
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,100
the different folks who are taking this break.

539
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:06,100
And this service is a service that is being done

540
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,100
by the people of the United States,

541
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,100
and that's why we're putting it on the table today.

542
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:19,100
I think the second part of my address and my sentence

543
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:24,100
is to say that I take this very difficult, very difficult

544
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:30,100
from the very beginning, and I think the people of the United States

545
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:36,100
are very much in trouble, and I think the people of the United States

546
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,260
are in trouble, and I think the people of the United

547
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,300
States are in trouble, and I think the people of the United

548
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,260
States are struggling through that crisis, and you see

549
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:55,300
the majority of us exponentially fall through that system.

550
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,660
So this depends

551
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:02,260
on how we fix those things together that can only be done

552
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:21,760
We are, of course, taking this very también witfully with the work that's going on in college in England and in going out, and screaming, saying they can't do it, they have no choice but to want to do it and they still don't have the courage to do it.

553
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,980
I think that's part of the students' skills and the idea that it's worth there.

554
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,980
Let's see.

555
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:39,600
I can say this is his main approach for早ogate

556
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,840
They Kun thực rekия.

557
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,120
They just talked there.

558
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:54,340
They discussed strange

559
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:54,980
things.

560
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,800
It obviously has been very positive experience.

561
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,100
And that's how I got my one- đing easy.

562
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,720
Over like, five years I had, uh,

563
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,300
four, five great golden medals for the International

564
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,900
كون평. The National ONE stratern Jimin atvenant

565
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,680
andcourse, and only one medal, can I really be proud of all the

566
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,240
this in hid from a

567
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,480
of

568
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:35,140
of

569
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:40,140
And he's already doing a lot of such a thing with the film.

570
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,140
And I also just felt that the director,

571
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,140
I don't know if I should say,

572
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,140
he's doing a lot of this recently.

573
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,140
So we have done a lot of actual choice.

574
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,140
I think we'll have to do a lot more there.

575
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,140
So, and, yes.

576
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,140
I think that the director is a good example

577
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,140
of the kind of story that you have in your films.

578
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,140
I think that the effects of the film are very, very strong.

579
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,140
And so I think that the director,

580
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,140
because of the extreme material standards,

581
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,140
and the fact that the director really has a passion,

582
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,140
and he's done a great job of showing through the film story.

583
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:24,140
And I just feel that I'm very, very, very excited

584
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,140
that the director has done a lot of this.

585
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,140
And I feel that I'm so excited.

586
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,140
And I think that the director,

587
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,140
because of the extreme material standards,

588
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,140
and the fact that the director has a passion,

589
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,140
and he's done a great job of showing through the film story,

590
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,140
and so I think that the director is a very, very,

591
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,140
very good example of a great experience.

592
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,140
And I think that the director is very, very, very good at that.

593
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,140
And I think that the director is very, very good at that.

594
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:57,140
So I think that's a very successful film,

595
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,140
and I think that the director is very, very good at that.
