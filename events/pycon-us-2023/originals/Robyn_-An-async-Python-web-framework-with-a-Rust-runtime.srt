1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,720
We are known for the

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:33,900
It will be so with

3
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:59,740
but you'll also look for the

4
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,660
I think you do a very good job losing the colours

5
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,440
Jan is an excellent master artist

6
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,340
His writemaps are better

7
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,000
and so he is doing a very good job

8
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,180
I had heard some other experts in Egypt

9
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:16,600
So we prefer the

10
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,020
these inland situations , a large number of people,

11
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:29,520
have to settle in the low of the neighboring coast on the

12
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,780
light of sight.

13
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:50,180
About

14
00:02:50,180 --> 00:03:03,920
the

15
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,240
who just dramatically shakes

16
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,080
Turkisharenç Apollo A's

17
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,420
Yes!

18
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,520
Aldan

19
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,200
I just wanted to say

20
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,980
there's no maximum consensus

21
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,140
regarding how we developments

22
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,700
function, or how we mall

23
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,140
how the positions work

24
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,580
and how we strengthen population

25
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,980
La Gallo has always been a place

26
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,060
where

27
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:52,760
Any Stephen Soup, a

28
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:45,240
with the

29
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,840
present ethos of radio and radio and 프로.

30
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,840
I was very happy to be able to be a part of it.

31
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,840
I was very excited.

32
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,840
I was so excited about the fact that I was able to be a part of it.

33
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
I was very happy to be able to be a part of it.

34
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,840
I was very happy to be able to be a part of it.

35
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,840
I was very happy to be able to be a part of it.

36
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
I was very happy to be able to be a part of it.

37
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
I was very happy to be able to be a part of it.

38
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
I was very happy to be able to be a part of it.

39
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
I was very happy to be able to be a part of it.

40
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,840
I was very happy to be a part of it.

41
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
I was very happy to be a part of it.

42
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
I was very happy to be a part of it.

43
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,280
Tonight, opposing parties meet at the

44
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,560
United States assembly meeting,

45
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,440
with Congress in даumping,

46
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,780
the arrangements for our festival.

47
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,360
So McCartey and the jury now agree

48
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,240
that the Public Appauly Award ceremony

49
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
will be awarded today.

50
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
OK, first- brag and truly,

51
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,880
because Manaal Ferris's

52
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,880
pops a lot of publicity along...

53
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,680
with other people today.

54
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,960
The tension hoy might be very strong

55
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,520
and message against and such as the

56
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,280
United States despite the only

57
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
Also, cause

58
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
By all of us

59
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,280
I should call this story

60
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,160
like a past of like-appearing reality,

61
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:45,420
not like a

62
00:07:46,200 --> 00:08:04,580
And it helps more than just get rid of

63
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,540
Get out.

64
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,420
Cool.

65
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:24,660
So they really appreciate the way this is happening and the success in the house

66
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,660
congratulate Excuse me, I haven't been around in a while

67
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,660
We could not celebrate this event

68
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:39,660
but we should celebrate it

69
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,840
Because it has

70
00:08:43,840 --> 00:09:13,840
I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to

71
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,840
say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say

72
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,840
that I have to say that I have to say that I have

73
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,380
that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have

74
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,380
that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have

75
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,420
that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that I have to say that

76
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,720
I have to say that I have to say that I have

77
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,220
I say that I have to say that I have

78
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,480
I say that.

79
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,500
My

80
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,500
friend

81
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,680
and

82
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,600
don't

83
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,100
for

84
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,300
I

85
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:50,300
But this is not the only reason that we should not be concerned about this matter.

86
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:56,300
As I have said before, it is about the same as the first of the previous,

87
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,300
the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last,

88
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:06,300
the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last,

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,300
the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last,

90
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,300
the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last,

91
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,300
the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last,

92
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,300
the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last,

93
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,300
the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last,

94
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,300
the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last,

95
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,300
the first of the last, the first of the last, first of the last,

96
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,300
the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last,

97
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,300
the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last,

98
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,300
the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last,

99
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:55,300
the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last, the first of the last,

100
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,300
the first of the last, and the second of the last, the first of the last,

101
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,080
Most students were norphal of material fragmentary,

102
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,440
그렇게 decir,

103
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,080
They have seen from the findings that 그럴 surprising

104
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,420
Therefore, such evidence is not on the table

105
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:18,660
A few weeks ago, the recognition ofWhere this site was located and

106
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,960
Obviously there was a public register

107
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,320
Holing information from other counsel

108
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:48,460
The suspectments great

109
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,680
for saying that

110
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,820
But just a mixture of intrinsic Senate

111
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,680
rules that I think has

112
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,300
made the kes.

113
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,520
It just gives written

114
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,220
as I've seen it,

115
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,320
that is, you have to know

116
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,640
what it stands for.

117
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,720
If you go on sharing,

118
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,960
you have sick

119
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,480
you need.

120
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,040
It'sulle rugby proud

121
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,000
lack of passion

122
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,840
is one of those

123
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,500
is well known

124
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,220
that's just

125
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:26,220
the

126
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:36,220
the

the

However,

155
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,540
when we are dealing with discussed challenges

156
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:35,840
we try our maximum to discredit the

157
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:39,560
Their

This trip was an transition

drop a little bit of the

183
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,380
example of the one imagined

184
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,380
is finally replaced with that

185
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,380
and in this way potato may also

186
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,380
speak to me in a newdas Local

187
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,380
way for value for value

188
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,380
for value for value

189
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:23,380
and what it means for jobs cheese affordability and Diaz

190
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,380
but I was going to mention main point..

191
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,960
the

192
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:40,720
main point of

193
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,920
because it's not just a religion,

194
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,080
but it's also a respect,

195
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,080
the tradition of the community.

196
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,880
The tradition of the community,

197
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,080
the tradition of the people,

198
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,880
the tradition of the people,

199
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,200
the tradition of the people,

200
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
the tradition of the people,

201
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
the tradition of the people,

202
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,880
the tradition of the people,

203
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,520
and the tradition of the people,

204
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,680
and the tradition of the people,

205
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
the tradition of the people,

206
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
the tradition of the people,

207
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,360
the tradition of the people,

208
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,840
and the tradition of the people,

209
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,840
the tradition of the people,

210
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,120
and the tradition of the people.

211
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,200
The traditions of the people

212
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,360
are basicallygal coaches of that thing.

213
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,680
The traditions of the people

214
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,840
are basicallygal coaches of that thing.

215
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,160
And that's exactlywhat operation

216
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
was supposed to be.

217
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,660
And it's not just fighting

218
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,660
that kind of accident.

219
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,160
It's that this enforcement

220
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
and that this threat

221
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,380
this б الرошт to put

222
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,380
is because you are

223
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,080
trying to Teskeet,

224
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,920
where we say everything

225
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,060
is under its control,

226
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,640
is not just man's husband

227
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,440
with mañana and night.

228
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,600
We can't always do it

229
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
the way we think it is.

230
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,840
The question is, how do you find out if you're doing a good job?

231
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
How do you find out if you're doing a good job?

232
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,640
And how do you set the conditions of your life

233
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,680
in order to do the right thing?

234
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,000
And how do you find out if you're doing a good job?

235
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,920
How do you get this right?

236
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,240
So, as a designer,

237
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,800
I have a specific type of direction.

238
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,280
It's not about what I do.

239
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,080
It's about what I do,

240
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,760
and I'm going to show you how to do that.

241
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,120
I have my work

242
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,320
design at Taste It.

243
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:15,960
And I've labelled myself a designer.

244
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,080
I've trained class leaders

245
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,120
and looked at different designs and different YA projects.

246
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,960
I've looked at different designs of different YA projects.

247
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,280
I've invested in more cultural storytelling,

248
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,440
down to sports,

249
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,720
sportsiskt,

250
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,520
sportsático,

251
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,120
And also for me, I was not the artist who picked any of his music projects,

252
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,120
I picked anything, and I feel that they were great together on the album.

253
00:19:47,520 --> 00:20:00,640
When I woke up, my wife, deuxième

254
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,560
Later, in particular, during the course of the stall collection in valley,

255
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,180
we see a terrible omen of documented war on the

256
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,560
Matsuk beans.

257
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,640
Two marches during the whole eight days of celebrating,

258
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,120
specifics and contributions to remaining conditions.

259
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:11,540
Ye was

260
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,480
online group to operations marketing of the

261
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:14,960
II.

262
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,000
And we could perform over the

263
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,880
doctors completed different

264
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,640
major neither Joss

265
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,440
who isn't a

266
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,880
started

267
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,200
versus

268
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,320
I will try to explain how I started and the Hopkins Foundation with my life experience.

269
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,540
My constant thinking between this business and my establishments,

270
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,320
I just said to make that decision,

271
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,480
And interest me must be trying to make this decision

272
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,900
To do business with people like hear here.

273
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,860
Flatly we sprach about lot of suggestions about

274
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,960
how to differently use Freelance

275
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,860
and to go out there and work together in the government.

276
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,000
How to raise awareness to others and to do this service better.

277
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,060
before setting out on this earth.

278
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,720
And so these necessary ignoring

279
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,400
approach...)

280
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,300
Which is Friendship

281
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,340
to Inside Access REALITY

282
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:41,960
After Sustaining

283
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,020
paw

284
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,080
and

285
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,440
Developers

286
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,960
are

287
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,660
2017

288
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,800
Including

289
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,180
Holland

290
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:20,560
they chose

291
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,200
spells there.

292
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,660
We wanted to learn the examples Sans

293
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,340
and waterfall, come together build

294
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,040
a common thing, performing anthrax

295
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,520
This will also support

296
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,800
general Basic saturated

297
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,100
is to build a separate

298
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,020
municipal built foundation

299
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,940
if there is a problem

300
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,000
it produces a global impact

301
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,200
Which is similar to eyebrows

302
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,940
hauling this is and

303
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,120
it's done in a joint attempt

304
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,640
to address a problem

305
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,640
And I think that's the most important thing.

306
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,640
And I think that's the most important thing.

307
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
And I think that's the most important thing.

308
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,640
And I think that's the most important thing.

309
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,640
And I think that's the most important thing.

310
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,640
And I think that's the most important thing.

311
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,640
And I think that's the most important thing.

312
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,640
And I think that's the most important thing.

313
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,640
And I think that's the most important thing.

314
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,640
And I think that's the most important thing.

315
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,640
And I think that's the most important thing.

316
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,640
And I think that's the most important thing.

317
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,640
And I think that's the most important thing.

318
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,640
And I think that's the most important thing.

319
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,640
Are you peeking these words as Shap Steel said?

320
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
Are you peeking these words as Shap Steel said?

321
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,640
So with both of these words or not,

322
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
Are you peeking these words or not,

323
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
I think you have a god in your soul,

324
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,640
I think you have a god in your soul,

325
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
lastly, these sounds like you're saying

326
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
nothing but they do to us

327
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,640
Since the first time it was leather,

328
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,640
I didn't thinkff that this was God's work

329
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
And these were only the old moulded scoff,

330
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,640
And these were only the old moulded scoff,

331
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,640
and some of those was leather,

332
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
ok?

333
00:23:50,640 --> 00:24:00,960
Pleaseors and Rovers, I am not honoured with your
