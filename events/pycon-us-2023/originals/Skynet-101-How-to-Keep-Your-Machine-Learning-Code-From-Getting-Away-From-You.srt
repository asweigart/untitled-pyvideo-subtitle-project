President Serra?

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,680
Other than the fact that you don't have to say that

5
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,720
Yang is going to stand atants fault that he will,

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,500
doesn't he, because of players,

7
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,560
doesn't he?

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,860
Whilst he's not giving theructurehe isn't

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,440
At the rate of 75% over time, are we starting to realise that?

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,960
I will say trust would be taken if the development fruits of our

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,320

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:17,220
Thank you I will pass it over to spring

16
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,880
sometime within three decades.

17
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,080
Then it also completely isn't omitted

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,000
for quite some time,

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:30,060
so you can perpetuate false scholar

00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,900
renovation techniques through research.

21
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,060
There are certain steps we can take

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,340
between leading research papers

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,800
and managing the research papers.

24
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,660
I did this in 2010,

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,200
and I was fortunate enough to get a job

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,440
at nervantimore.com.

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,080
It was disadvantageous for people

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,720
with low 할stomatic symptoms

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,280

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,120
I knew these jobs will be如果

00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,160
Please provide that information.

take

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,080
So I guess that either

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,580
You know anyways

And it's called as deletion of interest dealing with theseossex issues in America,

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,620
but again it's based upon the book So what actually ends in a specific sometime

41
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,920
attribute is the inf digital information center.

42
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,480
In this case it's just a location with the data from the democratic

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,180
administration in those days.

44
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,680
Okay so what I'm showing in this video there's no real problem getting

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,780
frying into the track.

46
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,480
And so it's up to those superstars to use all these tablets we've brought

47
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,460
There's a number of Spirit S fantasy and write about,

48
00:02:49,460 --> 00:03:09,800
or better than

00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,040
They have replacements of the components of their experiments in which memories cannot

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:30,580
touch or

51

but always to answer their questions immediate,

52
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,400
at least to my own transposition.

53
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,420
Instead, nobody is Wars torso.

54
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,260
Then I noticed a part inspireing

00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,160

00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,740
Is they necessarily inigers not

we should otherwise be снова

that University.

63
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,000
There are several ways that the

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,900
president can come to his turf

65
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:16,760
the

66
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,320
there have been a lot of people不到 once a year.

67
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,380
The process has been very effective.

68
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,880
Those very leading dimensions contain the volume,

69
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,800
but there've just been changes.

70
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,840
Of course, look at the different special effects

71
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,980
of our time of service.

72
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,800
That doesn't simply mean that we have a specific department

73
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,260
that is more responsible about tiny areas.

74
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,720
There's a little trouble right now

75
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,980
with options of decision-making,

76
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,560
and the fact that the special effects

77
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,360
of that early on have ended.

78
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,800
These are the numerals that they've decided

79
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,840
for emotional outcomes.

80
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,420
Of course this up and down the chain

81
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,000
because these can't be palace returns via hangar л° 6.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The bravery will also help to grow the community along our way.

83
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,000
We are!)

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,480
when we learn about 10,000 objects that predictable�테's

85
00:04:51,500 --> 00:05:04,020
So that, in association with the

86
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,860
boards of directors became Shoppe thatdas

87
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,640
raporn

88
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,020
club

89
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:19,020
It's very important because we want to see this number as we go forward, because if this number is greater than the number of people who have lost their entities,

90
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,020
it means that any of the employees in the industry will be looking to split up.

91
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:31,020
So, it makes that data more stable and more convenient, and it's going to help us to find a time to do more of that.

92
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,020
So, this brings me into those two sections that we're going to be looking at.

93
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:41,020
First, we're going to be looking at the number of people who are facing the same problems as the number of drivers in this field.

94
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,020
So, we're going to be looking at the number of people who are facing the same problems as the number of drivers in this field.

95
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:54,020
So, one thing you can do is look at those three sections, which is the five sections, based on five sections,

96
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,020
we'll not be talking about the number of people facing the same problems.

97
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,020
We're going to be talking about the number of people facing the same problems, not the number of people facing the same problems.

98
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,020
How are we going to bring all of those people together?

99
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,020
Now, so we're going to be looking at the five sections that we're going to be looking at.

100
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:17,020
So, you're going to have to look at the five sections here, and then the ones that are going to be the most difficult to deal with.

101
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,020
And I'm going to be using the numbers that we've been looking at all of them, for example,

102
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,020
so here's something that I'm going to be looking at, for example, the five sections.

103
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:30,020
We're going to be looking at the people facing the same problems as the types of the sections in a beautiful way.

104
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,020
So, to write down the five sections, I'm going to use the numbers that are going to be there.

105
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,020
So, we have the number of people facing the same problems.

106
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,020
And we're also going to be looking at the people facing the same problems, based on five sections.

107
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,020
The five sections are the most difficult to deal with.

108
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,020
So, you're going to be testing people, and you're going to be looking at the different sections.

109
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,020
The sections are the most difficult to deal with.

110
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,020
The second list is the most difficult to deal with.

111
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,020
So, we have the five sections in the middle of the screen, or if you've got the other people facing the same problem,

112
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,020
not all sections are the most difficult to deal with.

113
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,020
At this point, you can say that we are all treated as being a first-rate institution,

114
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,020
not the most attractive way to face the problems we face,

115
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,020
and we actually get a lot more of those degrees than that person is today.

116
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,020
Finally, if you had that person just put out the eight-page screen,

117
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,020
that's actually the same thing you did today,

118
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:24,020
you would be able to tell the difference between the different cases of our state-of-the-art community-facing

119
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,020
that, but what about sections with new situations?

120
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,020
The había-sinhle's ourNichol fulfill their terms,

121
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,020
fly by our доп-bots so that they're not the only ones or only a handful of other structures

122
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,020
be byte- sonst by?

123
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,020
We have, in this case, a single one, and this contains the mouths of people outside the system.

124
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,020
We have a speak- un ohnetrigual limit to the router,

125
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:49,260
simply because our intoxication- it's not just trace- fuzzy but a 20-0 hesitation

126
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,020
from particularly the folks you are talking about-

127
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,020
and the fact that we're actually doing this

128
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,020
is actually a very good thing.

129
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,020
And I think that's great.

130
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,020
I think that's a good thing.

131
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,020
And I think that's a good thing.

132
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,020
Now, when it comes to the

133
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,020
development of the field of

134
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,020
engineering development,

135
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,020
once this has been

136
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,020
the most important test to get at,

137
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,020
there's a lot of the tests that's already

138
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,020
been done, and we've been able to do

139
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,020
a good job of doing it, and we're looking at

140
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,020
the best. So, as we've written,

141
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,020
the analysis of the impact of the

142
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,020
previous tests that we've done,

143
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,020
we've done a good job of getting the best

144
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,020
results, and we've seen a lot of good results.

145
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,020
So, we're looking at the best results

146
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,020
in the last few years, and we're

147
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,020
going to get the best results. And I believe

148
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,020
that's a great thing to do.

149
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,020
I'm going to give you a little

150
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,020
bit of a brief introduction.

151
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,020
So, I'm going to give you a brief introduction

152
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,020
of the next two years, and I'm going to

153
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,020
talk about the next two years.

154
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,020
So, let's look at some of the things that we've done.

155
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,020
It was especially interesting hearing some Music Points

156
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,020
for som Isa in the first year of this class

157
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,020
looking at the other events. So i the first one was

158
00:08:53,020 --> 00:09:15,020
continuing music, and I was really

159
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:26,120
of you, which I'll explain a little bit about and follow up with really quick, is Americans

160
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,040
are the ones with a little bit ofNEY pounds.

161
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,960
cost to return to it.

162
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:43,140
That has most certainly not been functionable.

163
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:53,740
So you might, with Outlook, see that one time they came with a

164
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,540
tool called Putty, and then at a certain time they did something

165
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:05,580
We have many, manyknowledge for you.

166
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,460
A very empty goodbye

167
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,200
In the most passionate face

168
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,560
Very nice出会

169
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,240
Very substantial

170
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,000
Very nice

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,700
Farewell

172
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:40,380
and their

173
00:10:40,380 --> 00:11:06,820
point safely.

174
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:14,060
and how an organization is becoming more and more organized and globally distributed,

175
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:36,540
and creating more�

176
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,900
There's no other person sitting on theize.

177
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,580
I don't know much about that,

178
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,240
but I just did't know that either.

179
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,000
In my bag, maybe three of us.

180
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,060
So that being said, I do need a reference

181
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,400
because we just want some new stuff

182
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,920
to be rarer than we were last week.

183
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,280
So what did we do?

184
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,980
We did search for those links

185
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,580
in the overview of those sites.

186
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:04,760
We took

187
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,940
people from chilies

188
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,560
of questions. But to ask kind of big questions, I want to say that this is money that comes

189
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,260
all the time. This is sometimes 20 us dollars. Data around the world is basically missing

190
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,980
completely from the source. So the inputs in this rule often often refer to a complex

191
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,660
model of interesting information based on information.

192
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:30,900
And I don't know if you notice that mostly this is the paper that contains data. Nit weten

193
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,420
Plus these are the HIS periods. Democracy is reallyTechnical harmonizing fact noticeable

194
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,540
to get it in the

195
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:58,900
idea

196
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,260
Теперь, the many children that Mike talked about earlier,

197
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,140
you know, sort of space and cultural friendship and

198
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,980
change are afraid of you, you know,

199
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,720
a lot of the things that they're afraid of,

200
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,200
they always find that it's other people who...

201
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,920
they always have painted the mess.

202
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,880
So the most important part for people who paint the mess

203
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,320
is how피 they can karış worrying changes,

204
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,100
so you can kind of ug Gotcha put that in

205
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,120
you can use that in statues.

206
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,420
So once again we would like to show you

207
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,420
And that's really the way it is.

208
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,420
And it's really beautiful.

209
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,420
And it's a lot of fun.

210
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,420
And I'm going to show you the slides.

211
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,420
So you have actually one right here.

212
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,420
And that's the large company that's making this thing.

213
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,420
So if you have to go through this, I'm going to show you.

214
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,420
And you can go over to the back.

215
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,420
And you can see the slides.

216
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,420
And this is just one of the things that we're going to show you.

217
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,420
So for example, if you have to go through the slides,

218
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,420
there are three things that you have to do.

219
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,420
One is to be able to use the spectrum and the two other things

220
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,420
that are coming from the other components.

221
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,420
So to go there, you actually need to use the spectrum

222
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,420
to make these measurements.

223
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,420
So you have to be able to use the spectrum.

224
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,420
We've just returned to the different parts of the spectrum.

225
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,420
So you can use the spectrum to measure the data.

226
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,420
One thing about this is that you can use the spectrum

227
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,420
to measure the data.

228
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,420
So this is just a sample.

229
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,420
So as I said, even if the data is completely blank,

230
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,420
you can still get the data.

231
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,420
How?

232
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,420
Which comes from the spectrum.

233
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,420
And it's actually a very simple way to use the spectrum

234
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,420
to measure the data.

235
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,420
So now we know just the two components that are coming from

236
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,420
the other components, and that's the same as the first thing.

237
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
We want to know which of the four things should be done

238
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,420
in the next step in the next step.

239
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,420
And how do you make this information so easy to understand?

240
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,420
We say, first, I'm going to show you the quantities.

241
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,420
And all they look at are the parameters in that.

242
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,420
So price them up, and then come up with this.

243
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,420
We've got to compare them, uh,jan to?

244
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,420
Jan to.

245
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,420
What else?

246
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,420
And what I want to tell you is that ourivo

247
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,420
has this vision and this structure plan.

248
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,420
It has our vision literally within our system of configurations and

249
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,060
we think something like that's going to be an interesting

250
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,180
approach to paper approach to E planning.

251
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,420
So Chinese companies will need to think twice about

252
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,780
this type of system, this type of cream, we don't want it to be

253
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,780
too SHARP.

254
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,420
So in a gum-par ging treatment in an ice-cream grill.

255
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,420
That's a great way to do this.

256
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,420
It has a lot of key keeps, also the flow-ups from that,

257
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,360
O Warsaw Department of Stationary Administration,

258
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,700
West Memorial handmade products

259
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,620
and those are single list items which we have.

260
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,380
So we are only a fewixísOh,l

261
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,540
of the origins of American jeans.

262
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,100
We are not pushing these wild.

263
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,680
And we wantforefore,

264
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,320
we want these in your hands

265
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,700
as we knock it out of liberation.

266
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,300
And so we want folks to get to depends

267
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,300
on the different cards.

268
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,480
The card is available touu

269
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,080
as well as the women,

270
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,660
We shin battlefield and special training

271
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,660
And I think that's the biggest thing that I've ever seen.

272
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,660
And I think that's the biggest thing that I've ever seen.

273
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,660
That's the biggest thing that I've ever seen.

274
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,660
And I think that's the biggest thing that I've ever seen.

275
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,660
That's the biggest thing that I've ever seen.

276
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,660
That's the biggest thing that I've ever seen.

277
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,660
That's the biggest thing that I've ever seen.

278
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,660
That's the biggest thing that I've ever seen.

279
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,660
That's the biggest thing that I've ever seen.

280
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,660
That's the biggest thing that I've ever seen.

281
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,660
That's the biggest thing that I've ever seen.

282
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
That's the biggest thing that I've ever seen.

283
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,660
That's the biggest thing that I've ever seen.

284
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,660
That's the biggest thing that I've ever seen.

285
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:44,900
I think when we looked at the

286
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,660
That's just it.

287
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,660
That's just it for us.

288
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,660
Okay, we're gonna talk about this problem.

289
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,660
Now, we're gonna use this problem to look at the way

290
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,660
that it can change that perception of something else.

291
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,660
So, the whole point is that we need to expand

292
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,660
this thing more and more.

293
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,660
So, this is a way that we can see how things are changing.

294
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,660
So, now, we're going to do a different kind of

295
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,660
perception of something else.

296
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,660
It is more creative and it's more creative

297
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,660
and it's more creative in terms of the work that we do.

298
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,660
And, you know, I think we're just gonna try

299
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,660
to get at least a perception of this.

300
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,660
So, what we're gonna do is try to get at least

301
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,660
a perception of this thing.

302
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,660
And then we're gonna do a different kind of

303
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,660
perception of this thing.

304
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,660
So, that's the idea of what we're gonna do.

305
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,660
Okay, cool.

306
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,660
Now, we're gonna get to the idea of how we do

307
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,660
this thing.

308
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,660
So, we're gonna talk about this a little bit more

309
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,660
in terms of our experiences.

310
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,660
So, if you're learning about it,

311
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,660
I think there's a lot of different ways that you can

312
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,660
use it to really help you kind of understand what it is

313
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,660
and there's so many different ways that you can do it

314
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,660
in a minute.

315
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,660
And then, we're gonna do a way of waiting

316
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,660
for the four things that we're gonna do

317
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,660
to help you understand what it is.

318
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,660
So, the first frequency is the first time

319
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,660
that I would have seen something like this

320
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,660
in my life.

321
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,660
And then there's five different frequencies

322
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,660
that we're gonna use to understand what it is

323
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,660
and what it is that we're gonna use.

324
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,660
So, I'm gonna bring fours of all the different

325
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,660
things that I have here.

326
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,660
So, that's all the different frequencies that I want

327
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,660
to explain to you the way that I'm gonna do this.

328
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,660
And then, simply looking at the four things

329
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,660
that I have here is the first frequency

330
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,660
that I would have seen.

331
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,660
So, if we take four of those different frequencies

332
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,660
here, they are the five frequencies

333
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,660
that are the most common in those documents.

334
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,660
But then, you're starting to see some different

335
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,660
frequencies that we're talking about in those documents.

336
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,660
So, looking forward to reading them,

337
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,660
I would actually read them.

338
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,660
But, to do more of that, you need to remember

339
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,660
that the first frequency that we use for all of these

340
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,660
frequencies is the first frequency that we use

341
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,660
for the same problem.

342
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,660
And you're gonna use those frequencies

343
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,660
for the same problem.

344
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,660
So, the way that you're gonna get the dynamics

345
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,660
with that is gonna be faster.

346
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,660
So, now, we're gonna look at the example

347
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,660
of the way that those frequencies are

348
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,660
used in this document.

349
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,660
And so, that's basically the introduction

350
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,660
to the five frequencies that we have.

351
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,660
All the frequencies that we're using

352
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,660
are the first frequency that we use.

353
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,660
And so, we're gonna look at the frequencies

354
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,660
that we're using for all of these.

355
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,660
So, that the five frequencies that come to the

356
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,660
actual frequency of the problem

357
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,660
are the frequencies that we use for that.

358
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,660
We have, let's say, for this particular point,

359
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,660
the frequencies that we use for the

360
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,660
other frequencies that we use for the

361
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,660
actual frequency of the problem,

362
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,660
and these are the frequencies that we use for that.

363
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,660
A lot of them have been a fact already

364
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,660
in this presentation of folks' memories

365
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,660
of the way that we've organized our work

366
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,660
and how we've organized our work

367
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,660
for the way that we've organized our work.

368
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,660
So, we have one of the three axes

369
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,660
that is used for the initials of the

370
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,660
dynamic distance metric of the

371
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,660
dynamic distance matrix of the problem.

372
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,660
But we can start with the origin of

373
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,660
the dynamic distance matrix of the problem,

374
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,660
and so, what we're doing is that

375
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,660
basically, we're trying to look at the

376
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,660
dimensions of the problem, and we're

377
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,660
trying to look at the intersection of

378
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,660
the initials of the context, which

379
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,660
we're looking at the actual frequency

380
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,660
of the dynamic distance matrix of the problem,

381
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,660
and we're trying to look at the

382
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,660
intersection of the two elements.

383
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,660
So, we're going to go to the fourth

384
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,660
kind of interest that we're going to

385
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,660
look at, which is the intersection

386
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,660
of the words and the words that are used

387
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,660
next to them. So, here's the worst

388
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,660
example of how we can do that.

389
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,660
So, you would imagine that's the

390
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,660
only way to try to look at the first one.

391
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,660
But, we're going to run this through

392
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,660
a very very simple type of algorithm

393
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,660
that is basically a representation

394
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,660
of what we're trying to do. So, I'm going to

395
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,660
explain it here.

396
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,660
Because we have less time for

397
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,660
this type of algorithm, we're going to

398
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,660
use this type of algorithm, and that's

399
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,660
going to be very effective at using

400
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,660
this type of algorithm. So, we're going to use

401
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,660
the alternative way of thinking that looks

402
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,660
like a very complex way of thinking, and

403
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,660
this is a very complex problem.

404
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,660
And now, we're going to

405
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,660
go back to the beginning of the

406
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,660
structure of this equation.

407
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,660
We're going to take the equation 16

408
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,660
and its original value 15.

409
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:13,820
So we can basically

410
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,820
write this standing equation here.

411
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,820
Is anyone ever really confused,

412
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,820
when you think about what you just

413
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,820
represented on this board,

414
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,820
where did you represent the bottom edge?

415
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,820
Just look.

416
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,820
They were unique careers represented by the first time.

417
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,620
So I definiteברly feel that lower degreeぇ

418
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,620
because I'm a degree negroes since I vermised

419
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,620
that a lower degree compound with a lower degree

420
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,740
öl wasn't atuper成iv 볼.

421
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,340
So what do you know?

422
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,400
As the words say, it should mean la rate or the met servat

423
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:45,160
which means Start.

424
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,500
So what where you know was actually racism?

425
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,420
That is kinda crazy because I would be just explaining

426
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,820
this to a lot of people.

427
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,200
So what are you going to do if you're simply sitting here

428
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:21,140
which is זהquipe angé hoodjae

429
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,360
is related to a nice sunday program out inillery.

430
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,900
So that relation is very important.

431
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:46,680
So we still figure that the share the

432
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,840
08.

433
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,740
But as you guys each know,

434
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,880
about the botSpms. It was an amazing story.

435
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,300
My favorite features was the modules available

436
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,620
fromnow on for misogynistic help, so that that

437
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,100
just lets us know how to use the maps.

438
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:22,060
When I tried

439
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:32,720
You're not just onion走吧 I want red shark.

440
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:43,040
Just got another question from a viewer about federal agencies, maybe federal funding agencies,

441
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:57,080
T.C. dogs took out thema

442
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,280
Close.

443
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:09,380
Cook.

444
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,200
Stuck.

445
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,800
So, the last thing to think about is not just browser purchased software.

446
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,900
discoveries work best with users today.

447
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,600
So, listen closely about everything.

448
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,440
We would like to thank the

449
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:37,560
но furnished

450
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,420
but it would be nice to

451
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,420
So, we're going to start with the first question.

452
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,420
Okay.

453
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,420
So, we're going to start with the first question.

454
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,420
So, the presentation, anybody who wants to ask any questions,

455
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,420
we can do it with the slides, so we can go directly.

456
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,420
So, the first question is, what is the information

457
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,420
so that you can just answer the question?

458
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,420
So, usually a big, big, form holy spirit

459
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,420
is fundamental Christianity,

460
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:21,420
and what we do with that is cancel each of these

461
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,420
Ministers of Αō'akōia or of this alot of consciously

462
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,420
tror on the non-scienci system.

463
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,420
Since book number six spent 5 years

464
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,420
through the book over 30 pages of-

465
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,420
has been basically shameless I note

466
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,420
following specific orders which once again

467
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,420
is a secret weapon,

468
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,360
but then you do probably use that as a

469
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:45,060
other pretty. Thank you very much.

470
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,200
I'll hand over to Dr.

471
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,360
Stanford as well on behalf of our Board.

472
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,280
But the revisions fire and the

473
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,820
requirements can be pushed to the

474
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,160
majority, all party members.

475
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,820
My name is Moreover, Dean Shapiro,

476
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:10,320
As I told you, there'll be our website.
