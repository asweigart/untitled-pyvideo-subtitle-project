00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone. Welcome to the next session.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now it's after lunch, so you are still a bit sleepy, but I'm pretty sure that this topic will be really interesting.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So we have people like the microcontrollers and machine learnings here.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I guess that this is a really cool talk to be in.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So without further ado, let's welcome our speaker, Maria Jose Marina Contreras.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Thank you. I'm so excited to be here talking about this topic because I'm super excited and I love it.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Just to let you know, this talk is going to be, I hope not intense, but it will be with a lot of information.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Just be aware of that. But I hope that you enjoy as well as I am going to be.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And of course, if you have questions or something, we can always clarify everything.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's start. My name is Maria Jose. My background is in plant molecular biology.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I work as a data scientist in a company for indoor farming called InFarm in Germany.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And I mainly work with central data.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Also, in my free time, I enjoy work with embedded systems and of course, data science.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is the last process that I have been doing in the last years.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This was high and fun. Some weathering systems here, here.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Some kind of machine learning detection. You know if my plant works, think or not.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Maybe it was not necessary in these days, but you know. In other cases, it was necessary.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Also, I have been doing some very basic beginner-scale robotics.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Just to have fun, just to play around and share with the community.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
To motivate other people to start playing with microcontrollers.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And my next project was focusing on air quality in indoors.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And it was in that moment when I realized that I could do things a bit different.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's say, this system is working very well.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Our child is having here. We have here is two sensors.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is for particles. This is for fuel. And here we have a rasterized.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And then we have a second rasterized here where I was displaying the monitoring and also the carry this system.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But only for kids, what if I can have this system for the doors.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And then at some point I say, okay, well, but I cannot go for anything in my daily life with two rasterized sensors.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
As normal, imagine. As beautiful when I arrive running.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And it was in that moment I said, look, I'm going to start to find a solution to that.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Maybe there is some way that I can have this machine learning, capital data science in microcontrollers.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And this is how I start into finding an air.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's start from the beginning. I am going to show that there are going to be different levels of everything.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And as we are going to cover a lot of topics, I'm going to go really fast.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
No worries. But just to be sure that everyone is on the same page.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Well, in here I'm going to not say a lot, just to be sure that everyone is on the same page.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That machine learning is a fulfill of AI.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And also deep learning is a fulfill of machine learning.

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Specifically, we are going to talk about some neural networks, but more than two layers.

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Just to give you a point where we are.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Well, machine learning is everywhere.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And it's in recommendation systems, identification of objects,

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
classification, forecasting, NLP, and of course, what's above, chat boards.

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Lately, the tiny little hotchpotch, in the console, it's everywhere.

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And it will be more and more in our lives.

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But what is then worth tiny machine learning?

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Tiny machine learning is in between data science and electronics.

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's in the intersection between these two worlds.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We are going to go into that. And why?

50
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We can't know. Well, we can't have this machine learning autonomous in our system.

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We can't pull a process and have the art in our devices.

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is going to increase our data privacy.

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We are going to have lower energy consumption because the microcontroller doesn't consume a lot of power.

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's go on that later.

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Low latency. And also connectivity.

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
How many of you are working with IoT data, central data, daily business?

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay. And do you have some connectivity issues?

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah, I have them.

59
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I can tell you that for me it was an issue.

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm not trying to hear in my workplace.

61
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And I realized that this could be also very good alternative.

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What about the tiny amount of use cases that we have?

63
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We have in the field, kinetic maintenance.

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And kinetic maintenance is what we are going to go later on about because we are going to go into a sample where we are going to talk quite not deeply, but kind of specifically.

65
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We have healthcare devices.

66
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:32,000
For instance, in this publication, it was very cool because they were giving a very low cost for that just for blood pressure.

67
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Also, there are the sound recognition.

68
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Maybe some of you know about those devices that you say some keyword and say, hey, can you reproduce music?

69
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And you reproduce the music or other things, right?

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is also tiny amount.

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We have also smart spaces.

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There are some companies that need to detect if there is people inside or not before to have the alarm, drop the light.

73
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is also happening currently with tiny amount.

74
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We have the whole conservation project in here.

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This is very cool.

76
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Our is the program of conservation where they are tracking the elephants to know if there are furtive around and try to monitor them to avoid to kill the elephant.

77
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It is super nice application.

78
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And also we have agriculture.

79
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And maybe some of you are going to think, do you cook here?

80
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Because there are some places, some countries that the internet access to internet is limited or is costly or doesn't arrive.

81
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The application in your mobile without internet, this could help a lot of farmers.

82
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Well, let's read back again about this intersection of the tools.

83
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Because of course, this is a surprise.

84
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:24,000
When we talk about machine learning, we usually are doing our training, our elections in classes, CPUs in our computers.

85
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Of course, we have limitations of RAMs, of course.

86
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But it is not a big deal, right?

87
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You can manage and educate.

88
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
When we talk about embedded systems, we have them.

89
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And this is a topic that we are going to need to talk about.

90
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Of course, one of the features of our program is that you can have some bags, a bracelet, some euros, some cents.

91
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And also it can take for a long time.

92
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And also we have the low latency, but this implies that we'll be faster.

93
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Well, this is a tool that I found very interesting from this website.

94
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Be aware that these numbers, of course, could be different.

95
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But for me, it was kind of, I like it to see of which magnitude we were talking, right?

96
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
When we are comparing to about microprocessors, let's say, finding devices to see how different it is.

97
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And especially it will be key for memory and storage.

98
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This is super, super important that we have really to do.

99
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Well, what about the state of art of machine learning for microcontrollers running languages?

100
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Let's start with, in these days we have a project called 50-Python.

101
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
There we're generating text with the type DPP, CO3-8-Python.

102
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
There are not a lot of projects outside of 50-Python and HANY now.

103
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's a time for you.

104
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
For micro-Python, I found these two tutorials quite interesting, both of them.

105
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
One, this first is focused more on things videos and this is a neural network.

106
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And then we have in here on the bottom a library, a Python library called EverywhereNL,

107
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
where you could have the full Python using this library.

108
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I didn't try, to be honest, let me be honest here, but I thought it could be very interesting.

109
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That's what about other programming language.

110
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Of course, we have programming language.

111
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This book of HANYML with Arduino, if you are familiar, of course, with Python, but also with Arduino,

112
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
you're going to find very interesting examples, but I truly recommend at least to take a look

113
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
at the series, super well explained and very nice.

114
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But also we have C, C++, Java.

115
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
There are other options.

116
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And the pen.

117
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You're going to listen a lot of depends in this talk.

118
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Don't be afraid that depends on the situation of the project and the goal.

119
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You're going to need to evaluate what is the best for your project.

120
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Which kind of boards options do we have?

121
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This is just an example.

122
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
We pull up so many more boards.

123
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But I wanted to plug some of them.

124
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
On the bottom, we have some with scanners.

125
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Why?

126
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's because maybe I am doing some other development.

127
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
In the meanwhile, I am doing this talk.

128
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And maybe soon there are going to be some problems with some images things.

129
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I think it's a small spoiler.

130
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But in here, but also you can add your cameras in the other devices.

131
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And of course, you can use other devices.

132
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Close to this.

133
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
In C2, S2, and this kind.

134
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm going to focus on this one.

135
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
By the way, for the next slide.

136
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Because this is the one that I am taking out of place.

137
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I am working with it because it has some of the very interesting things.

138
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
First, it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

139
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Of course, for this project, it will not be necessary because we were talking about that.

140
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But for other projects, it will be.

141
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And also, you have the parents here.

142
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You have the pins headers.

143
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And you can connect directly the wires.

144
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And it's a development board.

145
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And it's very easy.

146
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Just arrive and work with.

147
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What do you need for do the setup?

148
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Do you need the board?

149
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Do you need the cables?

150
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And just a computer that runs Windows, Linux, or Mac OS.

151
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Just be careful and check your cables.

152
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Because let's be honest here, now that no one is listening to us.

153
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But I've had a lot of issues with that cable because I was not using it right.

154
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's not the same the cable for closing the data, but for closing the names.

155
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But now we can continue.

156
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But no one is listening.

157
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah, this was one of my mistakes when I was starting.

158
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The fact that the same cable for USB, right?

159
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's okay.

160
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But it works now.

161
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm sorry for this advice.

162
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's a lot of information, but I only want to explain all the data, all the steps that you will have for the initial hardware setup.

163
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Just to let you know that only in five steps, only in some minutes, you can have your setup of the board working.

164
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And now we can have the install.

165
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You only need to install the operating system.

166
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You need to build the application, set up the tools, set up the environment, and then you can start with the firewall.

167
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And you can have a better explanation here in the official documentation.

168
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But this again is like six, seven command lines.

169
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's like if you don't have any problems in minutes, you are ready.

170
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But for all the boards the same, no.

171
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's four and a half.

172
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The incident protocol, you're going to take the different setup.

173
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But well, this is one of the most exciting things that we have new challenge with each board.

174
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
This is how it looks like at Hello World.

175
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Also, I just wanted to share it to give you a little review of how easy could be to start Hello World on that.

176
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Step one, you prepare your code.

177
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Step two, you connect your board to the computer.

178
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Step three, you configure your project.

179
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Then appear this Google screen.

180
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That's for a Hello World distribution enter.

181
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And then you just need to build the project and slash it to the device.

182
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
In this case, it will not be Python code.

183
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're going to need to be aware of that.

184
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But of course, you can do it if you want.

185
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
In this case, it was just to take a look at the board was okay.

186
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The keyboard was working.

187
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Everything was working.

188
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And this is what you're going to get.

189
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And it's quite difficult to see.

190
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's just to show you what you're going to see in your terminal.

191
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm going to show that you can read it.

192
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's just what you're going to see.

193
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Well, let's go now for the machine learning path.

194
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Because we were covering the microcontroller.

195
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Let's go for the machine learning path.

196
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Okay.

197
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
How many data people do we have in the room?

198
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Can you write some plans?

199
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Okay.

200
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Like, 60, 65 at least.

201
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Don't kill me for write this workflow linear.

202
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I just wanted to simplify it for this talk.

203
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But all the data people knows that this is not linear.

204
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Data science is a creative process that we need to collect data,

205
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
process the data, check the teaser, it's okay.

206
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Do that again because we don't have enough data,

207
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
wait for everything, but it's not okay.

208
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Let's design the model now that it's okay.

209
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Wait, we need more data.

210
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And we are in this loop with the model.

211
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I wait, but not enough data.

212
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Let's be back.

213
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And again and again and again.

214
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But as I just wanted to simplify, I just write it in this horizontal way.

215
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
If your overwhelming at this point worries that there are some platforms,

216
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:04,000
this is one of the temple platform that you can have your whole pipeline.

217
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What you need to take a look is which devices are compatible.

218
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And also once you do the deployment in which programming language,

219
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
you can do the deployment in case that you want to drag the chain forward.

220
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Just be aware.

221
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's very, very important for this kind of project to be conscious of everything

222
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
that I mean this decision that you're going to make.

223
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Because you're going to see that we have a lot of limitations.

224
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Anyway.

225
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I tried and it was quite interesting.

226
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
However, I decided to go do it by my own.

227
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Because I wanted to play with the architecture and play around the path of machine learning.

228
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
To be honest.

229
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay.

230
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Now, let's wait for a bit.

231
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And let's start with the most hypothetical, pure, real use case.

232
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Let's imagine that you are walking around and you find your friend.

233
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
This is him.

234
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
This is me.

235
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Hi, how are you?

236
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
How is everything going?

237
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh, very good.

238
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I went to the platform you were talking about.

239
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I learned about my community.

240
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I learned everything is awesome.

241
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I know about political campaigns.

242
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh, what is that?

243
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Can you share a bit about it?

244
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yes.

245
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You can do a kind of like happening.

246
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
A training team.

247
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Little different maintenance.

248
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Let's say we have relative maintenance.

249
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That is the one that something breaks and then you fix it.

250
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You have the relative maintenance that if you maintain your bloodline before breaks,

251
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
like a car for instance.

252
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Okay.

253
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You have the option to predict what and when you're going to break.

254
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And then the school helps to make decisions or order new power or just manage a bit better things.

255
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And then you continue talking with your friend.

256
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And you say, yes, and then I can predict now anomalies.

257
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And you can say, well, I have a thought.

258
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I think because I was starting the business and I got a freak which is not new.

259
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's second hand.

260
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I would love to have that because it's very important to me to have fresh products.

261
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And I need to be sure that these freaks are going to be always running perfectly.

262
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And if I can prevent the damage, I need it.

263
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Well, no problem.

264
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Let's start implementing the assistance.

265
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
First point, data collection to prepare the data.

266
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You need to share this with your friends as well.

267
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We need to think about the sensors, how we are going to connect.

268
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And your friends understand perfectly.

269
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But no worries because the serious owner of the fix gives me data ready.

270
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I have the data for you.

271
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm sorry, this is not coming back on the internet.

272
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But just let me know.

273
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And then your friend gives you all this data.

274
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Be aware that these are public data sets that are not mine.

275
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:06,000
In case you do it, please just refer to the author or the people, the owner of the data set.

276
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Well, you have all these parameters.

277
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And you are very happy because it's like, OK, well, then let's start analyzing the data.

278
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Let's start understanding what has outliers because for anomaly detection,

279
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
we need to understand what's an outlier and what is an anomaly.

280
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Well, outliers don't data the data points that are not in the inflected anomaly view.

281
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
An anomaly is a specific type of outlier.

282
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
This means that anomaly is always an outlier, but not outliers are always an anomaly.

283
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And this is very, very important.

284
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And of course, when we are here in this great example,

285
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
it's very obvious that you have here something, and here maybe you have something else.

286
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And we need to understand if this is real or not because humans can detect some patterns

287
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
that then algorithms sometimes think that this is not a real pattern,

288
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
and this is very important, and sometimes we don't see patterns, and the algorithms can see them.

289
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And this is what we are very interested in.

290
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Then, let's go to define a model and train the model.

291
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
There are different modeling approaches for anomalies detection.

292
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You can start with statistical techniques.

293
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You can go for classical machine learning or go for deep learning.

294
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And definitely OK.

295
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
If you ask what is the best, it depends on the case, it depends on the business case,

296
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
it depends on what is your experience, it depends on how much time do you have,

297
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
how many interests you are going to have, and now it depends also on your board and your hardware

298
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,000
because now we are going to need to deploy it in an embedded system, and this is a new challenge.

299
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
In this case, I decided to go for a deep learning approach.

300
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Let's start with that.

301
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
OK, don't be scared about this table, but I love it because in this table summarize all the things

302
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
that we need to be aware to be sure that the system is going to work.

303
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:31,000
We need to know what are the training libraries for the model,

304
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
but also that are compatible with the platforms and also with the frameworks.

305
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
OK, then you can see in here, for instance, that we have neural network,

306
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
which has a new problem, I think it's almost everywhere,

307
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,000
but then if you want, for instance, go for SDM, for instance, or some progress with scikit-learn,

308
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
you can also have it.

309
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You don't need to run always deep learning.

310
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
This is very, very important.

311
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But always, you are going to need to check all this information before making decisions.

312
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
In this case, we are going to go for LSTM, which is a code approach.

313
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It will be auto encoded, to be honest.

314
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm not going to go into a lot of details about the architecture.

315
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I just want to show mindset that LSTM is an artificial neural network designed to detect patterns

316
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
during the time, sorry, like time series.

317
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Let's go here, some very interesting resources, and let's go for auto encoded.

318
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What about auto encoded and how it works?

319
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Imagine that you have a cake, which you love it, and you decide to say,

320
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
OK, I'm going to reproduce this cake.

321
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I know that there are flowers, flowers, eggs, chocolates.

322
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And at the end, oh, you do.

323
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I guess you already know what it is.

324
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And at the end, you can end up with different situations.

325
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
In one, you have a cake that is almost the same as the beginning,

326
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
but as the input, which will be the normal data.

327
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But then, you can also end up with the same map, with the same ingredients, with a cookie.

328
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
In this case, it will be an anomaly.

329
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And then, there is a tricky case that is this one, this is the pie, the between 10 million points.

330
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
That is the most, it will be the most tricky part, because there will be some that could be here,

331
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
but also could be here.

332
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
For this data, we are going to need to establish a threshold.

333
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And the threshold is going to be based on how important are the false positives,

334
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,000
the false negatives for you, for your case, and see how this affects your knowledge.

335
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Well, if you need more information, take a look to this link.

336
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
That is super good.

337
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
For setting this model, we are going to use normal data.

338
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
This means that if you know that the base background, that there was a problem with the fit,

339
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
this data problem needs to be out, because the model needs to learn what is normality

340
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
to detect the pattern for anomaly.

341
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And this is the result.

342
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
In this case, we have two classes, right?

343
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
We are going to have normal data, but in this case, it is the blue,

344
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
and then a normal data, but it is the orange.

345
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And this line shows kind of the threshold.

346
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
With them, you see some points here that are kind of false positives.

347
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And this is going to need some work and adjustment.

348
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Okay, well, then we have TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite for different points of the process,

349
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
like both the workflows.

350
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I am not going to go into all of the details, because I don't have a lot of time,

351
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
but just an important information.

352
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
TensorFlow Lite, it is an optimization of TensorFlow.

353
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It is a simplification and also an optimization of that.

354
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Take a look to the guide, TensorFlow, because it is very, very well explained

355
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
and it is super useful to understand it.

356
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,000
But this is not enough, because now we need to evaluate and optimize this model.

357
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Imagine that we decided that our model was perfect, the one that I showed you,

358
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
we can detect it, everyone is happy, our metrics, everything is okay.

359
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And we need to plan off our transits to put it inside the natural control.

360
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
There are different methodologies.

361
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I am going to just focus in quantization, but there are also kernels and other systems.

362
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:14,000
In this case, what is the goal is a conversion that reduces the model size

363
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:22,000
in a way that you have a range of values and you fit all these values into one number.

364
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And then what you are doing is converting your model of 30 to 16 or 32,

365
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
but also you are going to need to check your board to be sure that it is compatible.

366
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
More resources.

367
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And if you are wondering, okay, but where would you work in all this time?

368
00:29:47,000 --> 00:30:08,840
Of course, in my case, I was working in the

369
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:20,840
As a last point from the model deployment, one of the recommendations of TensorFlow Lite is a good example.

370
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,840
It's a business summary.

371
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,840
Generate a small TensorFlow that you can fit in your target device.

372
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,840
The important, always check that it's called fit.

373
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,840
Convert your model to TensorFlow Lite using the converter.

374
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,840
This is two lines of code.

375
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,840
Convert fit to fit and flash it to the microcontroller.

376
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:52,840
And then run the inference using the C++ and process the results.

377
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,840
This is one of the options, but it's not the only one.

378
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
This is what we were mentioning.

379
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,840
You are going to need to take a look to your business case and your business system.

380
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,840
With that, I'm going to finish.

381
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
Thank you so much.

382
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
Here is my information.

383
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,840
If you want to be in contact, I will be very happy.

384
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
Thank you so much.

385
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,840
We don't have enough time for questions, so we'll have the next session in 15 minutes.

386
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,840
But I guess if you want to report to Cedar later or something in the conference, you can do.

387
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
Thank you very much, Miriam.

388
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
Thank you.
