1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
lifeacre and we reminded our

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,100
respondents to think outside of the box.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,060
We think that we have given people the opportunity to

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,000
capitalise hasm openly but often in all of our

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,000
infections we see that we have not given them enough

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,220
covers and support and something that is needed in order

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,020
to do what we can to perform what

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,100
we have and we don't have so we all follow a

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,600
that is a problem.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,180
And I really don't have a clue.

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,500
I'm still looking at it.

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,980
Thank you.

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,340
I was in, and I really felt the crisis.

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,660
I felt welcome, so I went for a rail road,

15
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,620
and I got into a traffic crisis, and I was in a car accident.

16
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,020
And I was in a stupid car accident,

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,580
but I never got away.

18
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,260
Because I never did more choose to go to a local hospital.

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,700
So I went to a hospital, and it's a data crisis,

20
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,100
and I didn't even have a start-up opportunity.

21
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,100
I'll say it's two hours to get a data crisis,

22
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,860
and so I could just go to a data crisis.

23
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,540
Rather than a traffic crisis, I could go for it.

24
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,260
This is really good, because riding both classes

25
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,380
didn't help me with the data anymore.

26
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,540
I think that's not that cool, or that exciting,

27
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,900
to say, you're walking yourself out of the city.

28
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,020
Because if you go up to a city, and you're not looking

29
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,260
at the city, you need to have the full class

30
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,980
to treat your data system in a way that's reliable.

31
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,260
That's what I'm talking about.

32
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,420
And it's a lot more fun, and a much more efficient

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,220
way of helping our relations and classes.

34
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,820
There's really not the same class

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,420
that's been created as much as the other class.

36
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,780
Two-way training, two classes, and information

37
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,260
engineering, and that, and this, and that, and the data

38
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,660
problem.

39
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,860
The most terrific one, of course, is one of the things

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,700
that we say is that some of the subclasses

41
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,220
are the same size, but it's not the same size,

42
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,420
not the same size, but everything is the same.

43
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,940
The data service, the data security,

44
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,220
the systems, all those classes that we do not know about,

45
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,380
why we do them, it's not.

46
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,860
This related to the different classes

47
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,140
is called a state of the art system.

48
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,580
So you can say that some of the data is

49
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,580
in those, and some are in those.

50
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,340
Now, those classes are also in the same subclasses.

51
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,540
But they're still exactly the same size

52
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,220
as the other subclasses, especially in the real world.

53
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,540
So you might not be saying to the students,

54
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,700
but those classes are the same.

55
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,420
So in our example, there is no protection

56
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,100
for those classes from someone who wants to learn.

57
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,020
When you subclass a base class, there's

58
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,980
absolutely no protection from the base class.

59
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,300
So you make sense of the base class,

60
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,260
you can do anything to what you expect.

61
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,420
You get the idea.

62
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,260
Maybe as you use the data to do to get the model

63
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,580
and all the right methods for using those,

64
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,020
and you find yourself with no exception

65
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,740
if the base and the subclass.

66
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,940
This is the size of a list actually,

67
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,820
but it also goes both ways.

68
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,700
That's the first idea you want to hear,

69
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,900
is just say, what are the four methods?

70
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,180
And then if you look at the four base classes,

71
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,300
in the base class, the subclass is the same.

72
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,300
The answer is the same thing, but in the other.

73
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,060
If you do actually get the ones that still

74
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,780
use metal overhanding, or you have to keep

75
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,260
the radical in the back, it's kind of the same thing.

76
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,660
But you get to work this problem by using the double-hand.

77
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,140
You have to expect the real place.

78
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,540
You can't just get the other thing.

79
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,260
If you don't have the actual real data,

80
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,020
double-hand is still not the best idea.

81
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,500
It actually gives you problems.

82
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,780
I'm just going to let you guys know what I'm saying.

83
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,100
You get to see most of this stuff in the old concept

84
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,420
of the principle, which is like this.

85
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,020
It's like the principle for the big wave principle.

86
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,020
But more importantly, you've got this whole thing

87
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,580
that's not the real model.

88
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,740
This is some sort of a subclassy thing.

89
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,060
This is like asking someone to try this to motivate them.

90
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,300
Or telling them what you're going to tell them.

91
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,940
So all this means that there is no control over stuff.

92
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,260
And that's very strange.

93
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,020
But the 45 is kind of a kind of a problem.

94
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,820
But 25 and 25, it's the same.

95
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,020
I think it's great for people to try.

96
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,460
I think it's not that you don't know

97
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,140
what those 25 and 25 are saying.

98
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,580
So what I'm saying is those classes,

99
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,380
those are classes kind of five degrees from the other people.

100
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,940
And it's not hard to reason out that

101
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,900
if you do it, it's the other people.

102
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,220
And I've never been able to get to a place

103
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,700
that's more about going to a place

104
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,260
to be able to take you into this place.

105
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,700
But people are going to argue that it's really, really different.

106
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,900
Which is something that's hard to do.

107
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,060
Now, what I want to ask is, what is the difference

108
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,380
between a class, a one-student data,

109
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,100
or classes from class A to class B?

110
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,180
The last two cases is the average

111
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,300
between the ex-classes in class B.

112
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,220
Class A is less than a quarter.

113
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,300
A four- or five-degree difference.

114
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,300
Because I want to access closely one class B,

115
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,620
it has to be safe.

116
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,940
But it doesn't have to be.

117
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,460
And what I'm talking about is how people

118
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,180
can really reverse their religiousness

119
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,340
clearly, but not in such a way.

120
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,860
The relationship between a class B

121
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,060
is crystal clear, but the location

122
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,140
is not crystal clear.

123
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,540
It's all the streets are expressed in terms.

124
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,340
Now, the downside is that whenever you're

125
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,220
in a section of class A, you're also

126
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,300
seeing some contrasting.

127
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,580
And whenever you're accessed, that's a big problem.

128
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,460
It's really extremely relaxed.

129
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,620
But that's why.

130
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,140
And as the least-situated thing to do

131
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,540
is request that you spread the same class

132
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,660
for a certain class, or if you're welcome,

133
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,060
there is no way you want to send out

134
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,260
a message to the shop or the stores.

135
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,460
Now, the function of a class B, that's the equation.

136
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,380
That's this sphere that consists of the three classes

137
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,580
that I've put in place for the same relation.

138
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,260
So I'm not looking for us to swap the time

139
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,580
to do all of the other things.

140
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,340
So why do we start the last method, for instance?

141
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,100
Because let's do mechanical reasons.

142
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
So why do we start the first method?

143
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,420
Obviously, that would actually feel a little bit

144
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,420
like a fashion, but it's actually

145
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,020
made of the same laws as the second.

146
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,740
This generally is popular to communities

147
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,820
that kind of stick both in the south,

148
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,980
or wherever they are in the north.

149
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,180
For example, a place that's not as popular

150
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,420
as that in the east, but it actually works

151
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,500
for us to do this for big, few things, especially.

152
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,580
But I'll go into the west, and I'll

153
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,700
go into the right, and we'll go into the south.

154
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,300
And so let's go for a very, very tough

155
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,340
bit and talk about the thousandth

156
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,380
number of multiple threads and

157
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,740
multiple threads.

158
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,340
Math 얼굴, or Lettuce.

159
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,100
Swapt administrators create their own

160
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,040
network on a very, very peculiar

161
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,300
set of threads, and are sure they have

162
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,740
those numbers of inputs назывed

163
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,380
اتLS, $171,000, $14,000.

164
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,100
And then proof of Peyton,

165
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,820
which is one of the biggest Thomas

166
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,940
vergilers in the world.

167
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,540
And let's focus the exact same number

168
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,900
I'm going to be following the program again,

169
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,100
but next to that, I'm going to go with the original.

170
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,140
Particularly, this is the original subclass.

171
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,940
And I'm going to go with the original subclass.

172
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,740
So, you know that I first know, you know,

173
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,540
if you want to subclass, you're going to have to pass

174
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,540
the least possible grasp of all time.

175
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,220
So, it's probably closer to what Greg really did.

176
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,260
But I always know pieces to this,

177
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,020
I'm going to use that class, I think.

178
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,940
And that's what I thought it was,

179
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,060
really, this subclass, you can always use it.

180
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,340
I have problems thinking right through it.

181
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,140
That I was just about to start it,

182
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,740
but maybe I'll end up with a lot of problems.

183
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,580
It's serious, but I'm going to address it

184
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,460
probably, probably, a few weeks later.

185
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,020
But it would be a good time,

186
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,060
much smaller, to decide on a way.

187
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,740
So, what if you want to talk about subclasses?

188
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,700
Many problems in subclasses, and they have,

189
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,100
I don't know, more than a few,

190
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,060
I'm trying to use them as my program for this.

191
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,220
So, they will have a lot of like,

192
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,460
you know, like, questions, projects.

193
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,020
I think the really example for this is,

194
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,260
I'm trying to find my child,

195
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,540
and it's true all of them, they can suck one's head free.

196
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,780
They can try to deface it, but it's not that slow.

197
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,500
You just, you know, jump into quite different classes

198
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,540
to do a lot of things.

199
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,540
So, I'll tell you three, but which one is good?

200
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,220
Honestly, I have no idea, because I think you forget,

201
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,020
you know, there are special resources for work,

202
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,580
there's the lecture drive, the lecture write.

203
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,060
And this is actually easy, because it's all the classes,

204
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,900
all the works, by not using it,

205
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,100
you don't risk it, of course,

206
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,100
because you don't have to have a job.

207
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,060
And that's a part of your experience.

208
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,260
But it doesn't feel too real, because they're all there,

209
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,860
and you can look at it all at once.

210
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,220
But really, you know, the group,

211
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,060
the magicians, the art students,

212
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,900
but the whole class, that is just expected.

213
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,460
There is the lecture, all of us,

214
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,980
and there is the faculty.

215
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,260
What's gonna happen here?

216
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,260
And you practice with those, and yes, the students.

217
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,620
So this is what definitely happened now,

218
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,660
through our case, is quite a common pattern,

219
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,260
in fact, what all the magicians expect,

220
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,300
is that it's a great job concept.

221
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,380
And I have to admit, it is.

222
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,180
And I think I have a few solutions for my favorite,

223
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,980
I can do this, for example,

224
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,300
how to do it, this kind of thing.

225
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,620
Despite going to the folks,

226
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,700
this is one of the best times to do things,

227
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,860
because I feel interested in doing it,

228
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,420
and I think it all depends on the folks.

229
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,300
Like, they think that, not they have to have this,

230
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,820
they don't have, they are very serious,

231
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,380
and I think it's kind of a good thing,

232
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,860
because really, that's what you're gonna do,

233
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,700
it's a sweet, fun way to do it.

234
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,140
And I mean, folks, they're just great,

235
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,020
and I think I can do it, and I think it's a very good thing.

236
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,020
And I'm actually always, all my folks,

237
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,860
and that's true for this,

238
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,340
and my colleagues, and my teachers,

239
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,900
and the faculty, and all my friends,

240
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,380
they are all good, but I'm probably

241
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,540
quite lucky to be working with them.

242
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,340
But the first time I put this on,

243
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,820
it was for a reason, but that was not a few years ago.

244
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,700
I was a technical engineer, so to speak,

245
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,940
and I did break it up, I think,

246
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,060
like, seven or eight years ago.

247
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,820
But I think what was the greatest point,

248
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,780
why the last, I don't really know,

249
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,500
is that because it's this huge space,

250
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,300
and I don't know if it has a space to be able

251
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,660
to do something like that,

252
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,060
or to be able to do something like that.

253
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,540
So what we're doing, of course,

254
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,940
is we're looking for these special kind of equipment,

255
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,980
and we're looking for the kind of equipment

256
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,540
that's really specific to craftsmanship,

257
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,700
it's a device, and if you have a right to speak,

258
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,540
you're able to get more direction in your business,

259
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,220
and you use that process.

260
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,100
And then that's also a success,

261
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,380
you get more style, less conflict,

262
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,900
whatever you need in your life.

263
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,100
And if there's a big class,

264
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,380
it's time to get out of this, that's a success.

265
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,620
And you're really using it,

266
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,100
and you're applying it, and you're using it.

267
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,340
So it's probably a data class,

268
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,540
it's a good success.

269
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,860
And it just comes with the goal

270
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,540
to go to the graduate program, of course.

271
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,820
But I think that's cool, because it comes

272
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,340
with a full database, you know,

273
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,900
it's a good process,

274
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,500
which makes it more so than just using it,

275
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,340
and you can decide that,

276
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,940
and that's good, that it gives you

277
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,940
a lot more comfort.

278
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,620
But we are all together in our graduate,

279
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,180
and what's important for it,

280
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,140
you have to be kind of thinking

281
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,060
about the front end of the project.

282
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,420
And it's all different spaces,

283
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,380
but it's still a great success.

284
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,220
What the research shows you,

285
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,300
you can complete the front end of the project,

286
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,820
and that's a huge success.

287
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,580
And that's a success.

288
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,420
Why?

289
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,340
Both that.

290
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,420
There's an example in my book,

291
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,860
Matthew, Q and 4,

292
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,860
which is still in the book,

293
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,260
the River Stream.

294
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,380
Now that the research defined this here,

295
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,580
that you want to take that regular

296
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,820
report for each,

297
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,860
and add training to it.

298
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,020
So let's go over the best places

299
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,060
to collect the news.

300
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,860
So there's a classic and basic question.

301
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,940
So you say, so classic,

302
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,260
we recycle that stuff from the last,

303
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,100
that aspect of the class from bytes,

304
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,460
and that's from some class mutation.

305
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,180
This means that this class can't include

306
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,020
a bunch of bit bytes,

307
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,340
but you must have that class

308
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,860
that you're using to see how it's,

309
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,100
this is,

310
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,340
you have a bunch of bit bytes,

311
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,700
and you have a bunch of bit,

312
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,460
which is a great example of what you do,

313
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,740
and one x,

314
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,340
a product that that'll be used

315
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,940
for a specific data that you're

316
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,340
thinking of taking,

317
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,900
and a bunch of bit,

318
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,100
gets a kind of very straight,

319
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,020
it's a completely different scheme.

320
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,860
Now,

321
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,060
the class,

322
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,660
the data that the sample also took

323
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,380
from the previous hours,

324
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,740
is the whole thing that I made

325
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,700
before the last class,

326
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,540
but,

327
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,020
I just don't want this whole thing

328
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,100
to be a lot like the previous ones,

329
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,900
and for which you'll take the x,

330
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,540
you're gonna have a class that you've been using

331
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,660
for the same original time,

332
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,900
and it's not a number,

333
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,740
I know that's not gonna be

334
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,580
a specific number,

335
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,860
but,

336
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,420
when you do step-by-step classes,

337
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,620
you're gonna be using here,

338
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,260
methods which are loaded

339
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,700
with our unique sample process.

340
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,540
So, let's say that,

341
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,380
those are,

342
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,220
you know,

343
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,060
in the city,

344
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,500
so in the city methods,

345
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,580
in this case,

346
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,620
we've got that product,

347
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,660
which calls,

348
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,780
it's not product for x,

349
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,260
and,

350
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,100
x is the,

351
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,940
it's not the,

352
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,780
I think the way x is used,

353
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,620
is that,

354
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,460
is the sample,

355
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,300
and you get that,

356
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,060
I'll go fast here,

357
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,900
you get the,

358
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,740
you think,

359
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,580
it's nice to use,

360
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,420
and it's nice to get,

361
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,260
and it includes the data,

362
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,100
it's nice to use,

363
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,940
and it's nice to use.

364
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,780
Now, let's look at the,

365
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,620
so,

366
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,060
we can put a case in here,

367
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,900
and it's just,

368
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,180
which here is the sample,

369
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,020
from the college.

370
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,860
So, it's basically data,

371
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,860
so it's just a spread here,

372
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,700
so,

373
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,300
it's just a point,

374
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,900
so, we are calling it a state,

375
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,740
traffic,

376
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,740
and we're doing,

377
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,780
and it's not class,

378
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,900
it's the extra class,

379
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,740
which we,

380
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,580
we wanted to start with,

381
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,420
we had to call,

382
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,420
is the C4 example,

383
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,260
and it's the,

384
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,260
we used the x for the product,

385
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,100
for the product,

386
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,060
so, it's the extra class,

387
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,580
so, we're not using the x,

388
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,260
so, we're not using the x,

389
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,620
so, it's the extra class,

390
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,140
and it's the most important thing,

391
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,700
and,

392
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,540
and then,

393
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,380
so, we made the test,

394
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,420
the class of the tree,

395
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,780
by using the same method.

396
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,620
This is the,

397
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,460
the process,

398
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,780
this kind of box,

399
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,540
to introduce the product methods,

400
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,380
right,

401
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,220
right,

402
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,060
right,

403
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,180
the version of the book,

404
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,620
which shows the stress control,

405
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,020
so, we're going to,

406
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,980
we're going to do,

407
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,820
by this way,

408
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,340
so,

409
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,500
so, now,

410
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,340
due to this,

411
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,500
we're going to be switching this test,

412
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,340
traffic,

413
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,180
and we're going to do a data flow,

414
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,020
and that,

415
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,860
for that,

416
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,700
that's the goal question,

417
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,540
this form is the first one,

418
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,020
so, it's the extra class,

419
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,260
and it takes the i,

420
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,820
this is defined in a space class,

421
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,660
not in a class,

422
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,500
it's the extra class,

423
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,980
the other one is the individual class,

424
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,060
and it's defined in a space class,

425
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,900
right,

426
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,740
the second is,

427
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,580
by switching this,

428
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,420
the second is,

429
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,900
the last one,

430
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,100
called the super-separatism,

431
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,940
which,

432
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,020
I introduced prior to each day,

433
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,860
and it's the,

434
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,700
more important,

435
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,540
that you know what you're,

436
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,380
what's the product,

437
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,220
and you know,

438
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,060
so,

439
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,660
you're asked to use implementation,

440
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,180
you perform root optimization,

441
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,980
and you can do a root-specific

442
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,820
of all this,

443
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,640
in fact,

444
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,900
you write the process,

445
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,740
and,

446
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,700
we're going to do a test now,

447
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,540
but they are,

448
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,900
we're going to make this first thing.

449
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,780
One reason why this is such a good example,

450
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,620
is that,

451
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,020
if you just put a little bit of

452
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,860
super-separatism,

453
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,620
but you want the lower level code,

454
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,540
and you want to be able to replace

455
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,540
the lower level code,

456
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,820
the extra fucking report

457
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,460
is actually a regular report,

458
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,580
and for the class tracking,

459
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,220
so you want to be able to replace

460
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,820
the regular effects,

461
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,860
lower level,

462
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,700
because that's important,

463
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,060
because in the animal class,

464
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,500
those are classed in a separate class,

465
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,460
it's not a data-based,

466
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,300
it's like,

467
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,900
it's a root-specific,

468
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,740
so it is,

469
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,580
it's important to get over it,

470
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,300
to be able to add in the higher level,

471
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,860
to the lower level class,

472
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,860
so that the class is,

473
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,860
for the case of the animal,

474
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,060
a lower level,

475
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,900
and so,

476
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,740
the root-specific class,

477
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,860
so you can look for what's in there,

478
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,700
but the others,

479
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,740
that's my friend,

480
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,580
and you don't want that,

481
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,400
you can't just,

482
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,240
it's a class,

483
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,080
we have to have a class,

484
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,780
so it's not going to be based on zero.

485
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,980
And that's the root-specific,

486
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,220
like the root-specific one,

487
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,060
where,

488
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,140
it's a very interesting,

489
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,980
interesting,

490
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,340
interesting composition.

491
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,660
So one of the things that's quite interesting,

492
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,300
that we're going to be looking at today,

493
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,140
is what,

494
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,380
I just want to use,

495
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,700
that we call the tree-based expression,

496
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,540
but those products,

497
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,100
the most values,

498
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
is what is the big question,

499
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,580
what values,

500
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,740
are you going to solve it?

501
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,580
This is a large,

502
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,420
large information,

503
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,260
all around the points

504
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,940
that we're going to be looking for.

505
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,900
So let's start,

506
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,740
really quickly,

507
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,060
from the bottom,

508
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,820
and then start to find the various,

509
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,820
interesting,

510
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,180
interesting interfaces,

511
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,580
that introduce,

512
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,860
the conceptual thoughts,

513
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,700
like the books,

514
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,540
and it's like,

515
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,140
it's something like this.

516
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,980
So this is the little,

517
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
little setback,

518
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,140
expecting more,

519
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,780
that different spaces.

520
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,260
It's the,

521
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,100
the fact,

522
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,060
the methods of the public SDR,

523
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,900
to do a product that's not going to work,

524
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,420
to do a product that's not going to work.

525
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,260
And,

526
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,100
now,

527
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,260
someone wanted to do a product that was,

528
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,660
they could usually start the last,

529
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,780
and if people are not going to be there,

530
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,180
and if this is for the number,

531
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,020
number of people,

532
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,860
then they could start the product.

533
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,860
So I wanted to show,

534
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,700
how I think,

535
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,700
how this works,

536
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,540
this,

537
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,380
the steps of,

538
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,940
the steps of the product.

539
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,780
And,

540
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,340
there were the step classes of the ABCs,

541
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,180
there,

542
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,020
and so on.

543
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,860
But,

544
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,060
it probably was a bit of a failure,

545
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,700
if you're in the last section of my class,

546
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,780
which I personally prefer,

547
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,620
because,

548
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,820
because it's easier to have the answers.

549
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,140
So I wanted to show you here,

550
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,980
instead of five,

551
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,820
like some classes,

552
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,660
like five,

553
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,940
like five days,

554
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,780
I got one thing,

555
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,380
that I thought might be,

556
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,220
interesting,

557
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,060
and that,

558
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,460
can work in such a way,

559
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,300
that when you,

560
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,220
call from,

561
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,140
how are those companies,

562
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,980
in this particular case,

563
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,620
what's up with the last one?

564
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,860
But in the other side,

565
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,820
you have two ideas,

566
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,300
you're talking about platform,

567
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,140
and you look,

568
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,100
to see what companies do.

569
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,100
And,

570
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,380
it,

571
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,580
the one that I was excited about,

572
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,620
is the way,

573
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,260
where you can actually,

574
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,100
but it's a very,

575
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,940
very,

576
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,780
very,

577
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,620
very,

578
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,460
very,

579
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,300
very,

580
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,460
very,

581
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,460
somewhat flat level,

582
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,460
it's a flat level,

583
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,860
where it's based on,

584
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,780
so new products,

585
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,660
and 100 percent,

586
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,580
not 100%,

587
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,380
but nãoها volt actionable,

588
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,940
not many new products that,

589
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,900
can be made,

590
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,820
but it's also a high level,

591
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,700
where it's based on compensation.

592
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,700
But,

593
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
bits of slab,

594
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,300
it's a tax cut,

595
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,140
it may be finished video ,

596
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,980
like,

597
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,380
by another example.

598
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,820
Ter critically,

599
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,860
and as you've seen,

600
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,900
we have a group of 10 Film hiçbir,

601
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,740
ὅ� that is just themselves.

602
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:14,060
And this entire module which is carefully the

603
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:22,640
аюсь gomashim, chomanei, chy거든ia, yoman , billion, Angul, LyONE, 33來歓碌,

604
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,300
dot, and receiver.

605
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:35,080
An orbits is chequered by a

606
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,080
And there's this whole string of things happening.

607
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
And I've never been told that before.

608
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,080
And I've been by video much as before,

609
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,080
I was waiting for the time to get it, just like that.

610
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
And I think it's very useful,

611
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,080
because it allows me to find interfaces

612
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,080
on courses like the management school at all,

613
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,080
and stuff, and try to think,

614
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,080
think about this in the first place,

615
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,080
but I think it's a very, very good link.

616
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,080
And this is something.

617
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,080
So, actually, it's a straightforward interface.

618
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,080
So, that's important if you're using a set

619
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,080
like the example in the book.

620
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,080
And after we start, we expect slow,

621
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,080
fast, and fast division.

622
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,080
And if you do it, it goes, if you do it,

623
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
it's even more important if you're doing it,

624
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
because it's fast.

625
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,080
And we add the methods, the path,

626
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,080
which is exactly like before,

627
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,080
there's a function that you can get from the code,

628
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,080
it takes the product, it improves path,

629
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,080
it takes the knowledge, it improves the methods.

630
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,080
There are also some interesting things.

631
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,080
You can get the script, which is a product for the task.

632
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,080
So, here, that's the open data that you can use

633
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,080
and I'll just show you.

634
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,080
But it's not a couple of regular request queries

635
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
or any kind of feedback.

636
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,080
It's just fast way, yes.

637
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,080
And I think you can figure out what it's about

638
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
and I think you can figure out what it's about.

639
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,080
And so, the program is very interesting

640
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,080
and I think it's worth a try.

641
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,080
There's a great place to start to think about it.

642
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
There are great, very great places to start to think about it.

643
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,080
If you like, please do.

644
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,080
So, I'm going to say it's very interesting.

645
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,080
So, once you activate the function,

646
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
once you activate the function,

647
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,080
you can see the results of the test,

648
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,080
you can see the results of the test,

649
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,080
and you can see the results of the test.

650
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,080
I like the way that the four vectors in some cases

651
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,080
can take the script and use the district

652
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,080
and just run it in every, every aspect of the task

653
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
as well.

654
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,080
It's very interesting, right?

655
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,080
It's very interesting.

656
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,080
I just think it's very interesting.

657
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,080
I call it the district once because it's a process.

658
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
So, as you can see,

659
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,080
you can use the unit test for those other things as well.

660
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,080
So, that's the basic part.

661
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,080
Right, so,

662
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,080
with your three functional methods,

663
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,080
I think we can only use the standard method.

664
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
We have an active report here.

665
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
And it's really nice, nice.

666
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
And it's nice to see what we can do.

667
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
So, the first way, which now is kind of like,

668
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,080
you know, what I would call this,

669
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
it's a simple way to write,

670
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
I would write this simple way to write.

671
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
I would write first-person form.

672
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,080
And then there's things that are before and between.

673
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,080
I think that's what the video just takes the most.

674
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,080
But, first, I put out at the FHQ

675
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,080
all those specific forms of non-executive cryptography.

676
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,080
I saw the data I published here.

677
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,080
The most important thing is the method.

678
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,080
The method is that you still work with task management.

679
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,080
And I thought this was really exciting.

680
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,080
It is the right thing to do to understand at one point

681
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,080
what is the relationship between those two classes,

682
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,080
what that is, what is the difference.

683
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,080
So, this is the smallest,

684
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
I have probably used almost all of it.

685
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
And I have used it on a bunch of different sites.

686
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
And I hope you pay attention.

687
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,080
There is a lot of research here.

688
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,080
I have a few different actions to do with classes.

689
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
I've been doing some work.

690
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,080
And I've been taking tests at various sites.

691
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,080
There's more on how you run it from using those two spaces

692
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,080
because we use a polygons.

693
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
This step is still very exciting.

694
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,080
But I'm sure there's a few other three-point reference

695
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,080
that you'll be able to run the code on.

696
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,080
And I've done a bunch of different code

697
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
and stuff from different cases

698
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
in the French public code.

699
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,080
So, a lot of the code, great,

700
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,080
a lot of the code is like in one direction.

701
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,080
It's like, oh, it's one level, it's one level.

702
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
So, you develop that in the entry form

703
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,080
and then you follow the entry form in the classes.

704
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
And then you have many support points

705
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,080
and you have this task in front.

706
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
So, if all the code is a part of this project,

707
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,080
we inject the behavior structure into this project,

708
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
which makes the code easy to get started

709
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,080
in the places where it's going to be implemented.

710
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,080
And all of that is possible with the other things.

711
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
And those other fields, they're not that easy

712
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,080
to work with in the classes.

713
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,080
And I've done a lot of work with the project

714
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
in the training for a couple of years.

715
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,080
You see the different values,

716
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
the value of modules, the value of classes,

717
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,080
you can do the best in the best way to do your support.

718
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,080
And it is the lowest value, as well as the highest value

719
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,080
for the various materials that are in the interest of you

720
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,080
in the multi-media.

721
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,080
And you can add specific classes

722
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,080
and different types of code in the middle.

723
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,080
The other thing is the middle thing.

724
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,080
It's a product of the architecture of the software.

725
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,080
The logic is still the same.

726
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,080
It's not based on what I've used in the past two years.

727
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,080
And I've been exactly the best at making public projects.

728
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,080
So there are various ways to express the response

729
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
to other learning about testing.

730
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
There is learning about the web

731
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080
and design itself as four questions.

732
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
Those learning includes the thinking

733
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
that they've learned from the project

734
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
and the expression that starts with the architecture

735
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,080
because it's not a flat process.

736
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,080
But on this floor, a slide, a slide.

737
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,080
We can also take the way it's developed

738
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,080
to the project, but it requires knowledge

739
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,080
and specific from you.

740
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,080
Instead of just pushing the community

741
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
to the message of the logic of the code,

742
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,080
you can just do the thing.

743
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,080
So the analytics, which does the whole thing,

744
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,080
is like the pop-up code in the whole research environment

745
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,080
going up through the web.

746
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,080
That is the product used to follow

747
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,080
the platform of the top-secret,

748
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,080
the best web supported for web analytics.

749
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,080
How do you use this to express specific results?

750
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,080
And how do you show that you're learning from those people?

751
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,080
So that's it.

752
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,080
I just listed the main categories

753
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,080
of sources of specific knowledge.

754
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,080
So that's an important part of this.

755
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,080
But if you're interested,

756
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,080
click back for our slides.

757
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,080
It explains both relationships

758
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,080
in a special way.

759
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,080
In the instance of dark work,

760
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,080
I have binary cross-relationships

761
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,080
that can be translated into dark work

762
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
by using the features in those two relationships

763
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,080
at the same time.

764
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,080
So that applies both to dark work-likeities

765
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,080
and to specific values also

766
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,080
that are different to that.

767
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,080
Now, we call them our consumer-requested studies.

768
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,080
I just want to emphasize that

769
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,080
I have found just the right amount of resources.

770
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
In any case, that's great.

771
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,080
It's a lot of focus on the subject of

772
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,080
what's not very competitive,

773
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
but you use it to go.

774
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,080
They say, this is not a great idea.

775
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,080
This is not a good idea.

776
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,080
In fact, that's the way that we do it.

777
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,080
It's more about classes and certain instances

778
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,080
that are in the 1921, I think,

779
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
that's the way that we do it.

780
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,080
We also execute the ability to control

781
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:43,380
the

782
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:54,880

and they could get a lot of good points.

799
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,440
And that's the point. That's the point.

800
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,440
But let's really jump back into the subject of this.

801
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,440
This is a topic that I didn't understand before.

802
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,440
I think we're just as successful as it is in this particular year.

803
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,440
And all the subjects, the persons we've talked about in the class,

804
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,440
that's not the point, which I usually feel are things

805
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,440
that we should give everything back for.

806
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,440
First of all, I think this is a really interesting topic.

807
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,440
This is a topic that's been talked about a lot in the previous report,

808
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,440
which is the subject of our class, which is the subject of our class,

809
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
and by the way, this is specifically the subject of our class,

810
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,440
which is the subject of our class, and the rest of the subject of our class.

811
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,440
And the rest of the subject of our class is the subject of our class.

812
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,440
That I think is the point.

813
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,440
But I think that's a good point.

814
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,440
So first, let's jump back into the subject of our class.

815
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,440
As you can see, it's exactly two as we did.

816
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,440
So that's a concept that I've passed through, that I've passed through.

817
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,440
And I think that is your most important aspect of that.

818
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,440
And just now let's look at the general overview of this.

819
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,440
So, first, let's look at the general overview of this.

820
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,440
First, yes, that's the general overview of the subject.

821
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:54,440
Do you see the general impression that you guys put together to make this work?

822
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,440
So now can I understand the case that it's more simple to get the right answer

823
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,440
instead of having to close all borders on the planet?

824
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,440
So this was the next one we had to look at.

825
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,440
This was the next one we had to look at, which was the three days to make this work.

826
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,440
And I think that's a good point.

827
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,440
This also reveals one aspect of the interest of the fact that a lot of people have been

828
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,440
just waiting for the very first week after this,

829
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,440
and they've been waiting for a few weeks for the kind of process to work.

830
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Because basically, if I can do it in one place,

831
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,440
then I can do it in another place, and I can do it in another place.

832
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,440
And if the argument is in front of me that this could be the first time I've done this process,

833
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
then I can do it in another place.

834
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
So I've done this four times.

835
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,440
I've passed through a bunch of things in the past eight,

836
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,440
but I don't get any interest for either of them.

837
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,440
I just see the progress of it.

838
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
I don't.

839
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,440
If you're quite sure that this situation is the case,

840
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
then I want to be clear just in case.

841
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
Without taking the amount of interest that you're using,

842
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,440
I'm not going to speak one way.

843
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,440
It's just that you have to look at the basic types of everything that's possible

844
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,440
in this case, and you can't just look at a lot of things.

845
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,440
And you are getting into the next phase of things within the next one.

846
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,440
So I'm going to talk about metaclassics and subclassics.

847
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,440
They're just one of the big ones that we're seeing.

848
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,440
Not that we're going to say that general words use a sort of structure

849
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,440
to expect different things to happen to every single one of them.

850
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,440
Or that is to hope that all things in life will have a different vision for this type of thing.

851
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,440
But that doesn't mean that it makes part of this problem

852
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,440
as the subclasses might be coming together.

853
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
So this is actually the act.

854
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,440
One of the most subclasses is a form of discovery of the human identity

855
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,440
or what the best practice is to go.

856
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,440
Which we've just been wanting to take away from the act.

857
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,440
It's only said alongside because really,

858
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,440
because everything is expressed in the real, not the real.

859
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,440
Subclasses give us this real thing of giving us less information

860
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,440
from the real to the facts of things.

861
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,440
For example, the function of life is the concept of life.

862
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,440
And by looking at how many forms of activity there are,

863
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,440
where do they come from and what are they?

864
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,440
Basically, it's all subclasses, things, and installations.

865
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,440
So there may be concept work that's done by four people.

866
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,440
On the other side, there's all the other stuff.

867
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,440
So, convenience, less time, and everything else.

868
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,440
So it wasn't really a particular number of things.

869
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,440
So why do you think it's interesting?

870
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,440
And why do you think it's an everything?

871
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,440
Subclasses give you great insight into life,

872
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,440
that's something that's a form of practice for the functional reality.

873
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,440
Because this is a place of interest, and it's a place,

874
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,440
it's over, it's over the top, and it comes to that top.

875
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,440
So, yeah, it's a changeable object.

876
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,440
It's a place to develop things, and yeah, it's a good place.

877
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,440
So we've seen the effect, and it's created more than one.

878
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,440
And, yeah, it's a place where you can just think of it as a place to develop things.

879
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,440
So it's a little bit interesting.

880
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,440
All right, so now that I've done this,

881
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,440
we have the ability to establish and start by using a functional realm.

882
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,440
And this is by the fact that the four of us,

883
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,440
after we have all come to us, we have started by specifying the four layers.

884
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,440
So, it's slow, you go, and everything is more functional, especially.

885
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,440
But we still use those tools because it's a space.

886
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,440
Yeah, because that's what's the end of the universe,

887
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,440
where you spend most of your time.

888
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,440
But by the way, I'm going to go into this in a bit,

889
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,440
because I think that there is a voice that likes magic.

890
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,440
I don't think, I don't think, it's not right to use magic.

891
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,440
It's programming integrated into your path,

892
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,440
and it's a human being, not a bag,

893
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,440
and it's a person, right?

894
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,440
And I'm going to make it really simple, but it's simple.

895
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,440
Really, that is the whole requirement for all of us,

896
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,440
especially for us, is that we have to be able to

897
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,440
execute our problems from every single step of the way,

898
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,440
one after another.

899
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,440
And that's what we want, is to execute it for about three years,

900
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
and we'll have the same programming.

901
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,440
There's no such thing as a lot of problems.

902
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,440
They all become, you know, very, very simple.

903
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,440
So, of course, that voice, that's the ability of the voice,

904
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,440
and people find it very difficult to execute it

905
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,440
in your path and not in others.

906
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,440
Especially with the racing world,

907
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,440
obviously, there is no less success

908
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,440
than when you execute your problems.

909
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,440
And then, the third, or the third mistake,

910
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,440
is the third problem of the question.

911
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,440
Why is all this understanding and instruction going out?

912
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,440
I know we've been trapped in the concept

913
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,440
of non-requested responsibility,

914
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,440
but perhaps it's not going to focus

915
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,440
on the decision in the first few decisions.

916
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,440
But I agree that the only way to successfully keep that

917
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,440
code is just to have every confidence, just,

918
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,440
if you are correct in your own understanding of the system,

919
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,440
to once and that's what it is.

920
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,440
And again, let's do the limits,

921
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,440
let's not do the way that we might say.

922
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
This is the first question.

923
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
I would just say, certainly, that my three seconds

924
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
are very much to you,

925
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,440
but I'm waiting for some time to even enjoy

926
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,440
the ability to do that.

927
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,440
I mean, you know, the solutions,

928
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,440
they've been taken over and over and over again,

929
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,440
so that's not something we can focus on so much.

930
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,440
So, basically, what we're able to do,

931
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,440
we can focus on that, so go ahead.

932
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,440
The other aspect is that I've worked on this

933
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
for a long time, and I've worked on this

934
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,440
for a long time.

935
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,440
So my goal for today is not to stop

936
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,440
this fundamental question,

937
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
and my suggestion is that based on my experience

938
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,440
in the system, it is a very strong conclusion.

939
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,440
I've had some doubt, can you?

940
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,440
I've, through all the reports I've seen,

941
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,440
I've had some doubts.

942
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,440
So my goal for today is to make sure

943
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,440
we're not only in the position of failure,

944
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,440
but to make the right decisions,

945
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,440
to make sure that we know the different differences.

946
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,440
And therefore, I hope this will be the case.

947
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,440
And I hope that our folks who are involved

948
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,440
in this discussion will actually think

949
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,440
it goes too far to make the subplot

950
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,440
more very successful in some ways.

951
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,440
And we just need to be very clear.

952
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
Factors such as, well, there are factors such as

953
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,440
algorithms, which we need to be aware of,

954
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,440
to be able to best understand

955
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
what's going on, and we need to be able to

956
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,440
take some serious interest in

957
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,440
reducing the potential.

958
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,440
And I'm not sure I've said this enough,

959
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,440
but the word for that is that there are

960
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,440
some factors that are directly related

961
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,440
to the system, and that's the fact that

962
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,440
there are factors that are actually

963
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,440
far better than the number of records.

964
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,440
But that is, I think, a very serious focus

965
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,440
on the system, especially when

966
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,440
the workforce is in a situation

967
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
where there's a risk of failure

968
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,440
in some of the systems that we've discussed.

969
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,440
In fact, I might be right to call this

970
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,440
an algorithm, and it's really easy

971
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,440
to come and measure it, and it's

972
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,440
very simple to measure it.

973
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,440
So that's very good for the method

974
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,440
that's put it, and that's very good

975
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,440
by the way it's stated in the

976
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
composition of my book,

977
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,440
which is called The Method of Transition.

978
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,440
And I've always been very aware of this now,

979
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,440
that this goes much less than the fact

980
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,440
that there are some factors that are

981
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
definitely a structure that's probably

982
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,440
a huge, that are also a big factor

983
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
especially on the level of

984
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
the processing of the algorithm.

985
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,440
And it's just as much as the state

986
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
was thought.

987
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,440
But the method, in fact, that

988
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
usually is based on the

989
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
process of the problem,

990
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
but it's not the problem, it's the

991
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
kind of structure that's going to

992
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,440
be the reason.

993
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
So this is a correct way to do it.

994
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,440
And that is what I mean by the system,

995
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
because I was always in a

996
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
position of holding the

997
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,440
effective practice of the system,

998
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
and I had to do it by the

999
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
process.

1000
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,440
Of course, if you review the

1001
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
kind of things that are going to

1002
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
be happening, just like the

1003
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,440
program, and it's the best of

1004
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,440
all the programs, this might be

1005
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
a bit of a special way of

1006
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,440
like what I was before, and it's

1007
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
just as much as the state has

1008
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,440
thought, and it's very much the

1009
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
problem.

1010
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,440
And that is, the great

1011
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,440
system of the system is literally

1012
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
the required free adding and

1013
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,440
how it's going to be done.

1014
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,440
Now, I'm just going to give you

1015
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
a short summary of the

1016
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,440
problem that I was talking about.

1017
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,440
Why is it great?

1018
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,440
I know already that for

1019
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,440
users more than six years

1020
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,440
ago, there's a huge number of

1021
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
different situations.

1022
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,440
And if you were to review

1023
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,440
some of the problems, how are

1024
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,440
they?

1025
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,440
How does the system go for

1026
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,440
the rest?

1027
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,440
I think in Europe, there are

1028
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,440
some problems that we

1029
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
expect about it.

1030
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,440
You don't want to

1031
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,440
expect that you're too many

1032
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,440
floors from the system.

1033
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
You're going to have to

1034
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,440
expect the best functions, even

1035
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
if you're going to change the

1036
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
last one, and reset the

1037
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
performance when you're

1038
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,440
like, oh, today's the

1039
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,440
time is right.

1040
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,440
And you're also going to have

1041
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
to make sure that the

1042
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
first three are first-to-the-

1043
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,440
last.

1044
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,440
If you were to focus more on

1045
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
the first four, you're going to

1046
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
have to make sure that the

1047
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,440
first four are first-to-the-last.

1048
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,440
Again, some conditions,

1049
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,440
then if you were going

1050
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,440
to pick up large changes

1051
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:52,620
in the type of

1052
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,120
that we have to understand that we're going to be on the right track.

1053
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,620
But we can't just let them out on the wrong track,

1054
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,620
we can't just let them out on the wrong track.

1055
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,120
Without this relocation, we would have to put more

1056
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,120
of the sequence in the next next four weeks for logical reasons.

1057
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,120
As long as we don't put more of the documents for files.

1058
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,620
Because we're sure that we don't put the files

1059
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,120
already into the next next four weeks.

1060
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,620
So we are expecting now that we've got more of the sequence

1061
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,120
that we've got to move on to the next four weeks.

1062
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,120
It would be really great if we could move on to the next two weeks.

1063
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,620
Now, let's look at the one thing that we're going to see

1064
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,620
in those four weeks, and that's the fact that we're still

1065
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,620
getting the files ready for files.

1066
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,620
And that's the ability.

1067
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,120
And then, of course, the natural risk of this kind of event,

1068
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,120
especially in the freeze, is one of the best changes

1069
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,120
in the state of the state of the state.

1070
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,120
And so, it's important to start discussing about that.

1071
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,620
And it's not a problem for the state of the state.

1072
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,120
What about a state of the state?

1073
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,120
The state of the state is in the way.

1074
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,120
So, I think that's a good point.

1075
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,120
We've got to check our own files and get more specific

1076
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,120
about the state of the state.

1077
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,120
And it's nice to know that we made a suggestion.

1078
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,620
We've got to find this exact location and specific things

1079
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,120
that we're going to have to work on in the next four weeks.

1080
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,120
And that's the introduction.

1081
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,120
That's the process.

1082
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,620
And what else?

1083
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,620
This is the kind of process that we're going to be

1084
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,620
doing this morning.

1085
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,620
I would like to show you a few things.

1086
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,620
It's simple, but it is a kind of a security

1087
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,620
that we're going to be doing for the first,

1088
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,620
I think, five years of production.

1089
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,620
So, we're going to have to go over the data

1090
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,620
and see what happens.

1091
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,620
So, you can enable the data to be available

1092
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,620
to the managers and the staff to manage.

1093
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,620
And then, for all of you, which is not available,

1094
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,620
you can sort of share your feedbacks

1095
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,620
to all of our managers.

1096
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,620
So, it's a little bit of a task.

1097
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,620
But this little box is a little bit something

1098
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,620
that the managers get to spend a few days

1099
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,620
on their own, to set up a security.

1100
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:53,620
So, in this case, we're going to have to do this.

1101
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,620
And so, we're going to have to create a plan.

1102
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,620
So, a plan that's going to cover both of those.

1103
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,620
And the plan should be that using that plan,

1104
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,620
we're going to have to overlap the two boxes

1105
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,620
to be in the same area.

1106
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,620
So, this is a complex process.

1107
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,620
And you can see that the manager is very first started.

1108
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,620
Like, all your whole process is needed

1109
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,620
to continue to follow up.

1110
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,620
So, it's very important when you're briefing

1111
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,620
this one's self-awareness,

1112
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,620
and that's where you're making the decision.

1113
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,620
And that helps you to be able to find out

1114
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,620
what's in your communications.

1115
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,620
So, yeah, the follows are the stuff

1116
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,620
you have to pay attention to.

1117
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,620
You have to be comfortable with all this stuff

1118
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,620
because you're fast.

1119
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,620
And so, the first step is to find

1120
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,620
something that's more functional.

1121
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,620
Because it's a much more functional

1122
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,620
and much more expensive experience

1123
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,620
of getting out of my way.

1124
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,620
So, you're going to have to put it

1125
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,620
in a place that's less than just a site.

1126
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,620
So, don't put it in a place that's stuck

1127
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,620
in a place that's not in your comfort zone.

1128
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,620
That's going to put a lot of space

1129
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,620
in your thinking area.

1130
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,620
And you want to have a place in your comfort zone.

1131
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,620
And both, that's the right thing

1132
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,620
to do when you're training your team.

1133
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,620
So, you're going to have to be careful

1134
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,620
with what you're doing.

1135
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,620
You can tell because you're going to have

1136
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,620
to take a lot of time to think about

1137
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,620
what you're doing.

1138
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,620
You have to focus on programs.

1139
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,620
I'm starting off with a quick video

1140
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,620
of the opposite of what you're doing.

1141
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,620
Because there's no real good way to do it.

1142
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,620
So, for those who are starting out

1143
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,620
with a lot of practice from the start,

1144
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,620
the most important thing is to use it

1145
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,620
because they don't start that way.

1146
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,620
It's the right thing to do rather than

1147
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,620
to just do it.

1148
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,620
A step out of those, that's what I asked.

1149
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,620
So, I'll just show you

1150
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,620
a few things.

1151
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,620
So, here's a couple of things

1152
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,620
that you need to know about practice.

1153
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,620
You want to get to the base of it.

1154
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,620
Just practice.

1155
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,620
But, maybe the problem is here.

1156
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,620
And if you create a schedule

1157
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,620
and you start to think about problems

1158
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,620
and you're very busy, you need to talk to something.

1159
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,620
You're probably missing some

1160
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,620
of your senses.

1161
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,620
So, for example, if you're doing a

1162
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,620
very long business week,

1163
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,620
the best thing to do is to go out

1164
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,620
and get some coffee.

1165
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,620
This is probably the easiest way to do it.

1166
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,620
But then,

1167
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,620
you're going to go,

1168
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,620
you're going to go to the store,

1169
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,620
so that's the clearly way.

1170
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,620
It's still the easiest way to do it.

1171
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,620
And then you're going to go

1172
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,620
to the store,

1173
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,620
and you're going to go to the store,

1174
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,620
and you're going to go to the store.

1175
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,620
I will also position practice much more directly.

1176
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,620
And I've asked the question of practice

1177
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,620
very clearly, and what is?

1178
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,620
It's the question of the very best practice.

1179
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,620
But if we're not

1180
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,620
very clear,

1181
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,620
the person who's most familiar with this process

1182
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,620
is the person who

1183
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,620
who would have to very, very quickly

1184
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,620
spend the U.S. full of them, or like

1185
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,620
the full of them, and the full of us,

1186
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,620
it makes sense for them to have either a good experience

1187
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,620
with a better, and the fact that

1188
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,620
sometimes if you don't get the business, you don't get

1189
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,620
the experience, you don't get the

1190
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,620
experience of the person who's most familiar with this process.

1191
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,620
And then you're going to go in one direction,

1192
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,620
so that it's something that's really

1193
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,620
useful for the person who's most familiar

1194
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,620
with this process.

1195
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,620
So,

1196
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,620
all these things,

1197
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,620
they're just back to the front of the room.

1198
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,620
You can ask, because not everybody

1199
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,620
knows what it is, and they want to talk

1200
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,620
to you about it, and they say, I don't care,

1201
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,620
it's just my brain that's not practicing.

1202
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,620
And that's what this person is supposed to say.

1203
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,620
And that's what it is. And this

1204
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,620
is what it is. And you don't have

1205
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,620
to be like, I don't care, I'm just going to

1206
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,620
spend some time with you, just to finish this

1207
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,620
and you can start practicing. And you're

1208
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,620
going to start to get a good experience of it.

1209
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,620
And I'm sure that's good for the person

1210
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,620
that you are, to practice

1211
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,620
the process of something.

1212
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,620
But then, you think,

1213
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,620
that's just the place for people to have a good

1214
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,620
experience, or therefore have a good experience,

1215
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,620
of what it is. And then there's

1216
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,620
a lot of other things.

1217
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,620
So, I'm going to start by saying, the kind of

1218
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,620
visual approach that we do at the moment,

1219
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,620
is not just for the animation, it's for us.

1220
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,620
It's more of a specific,

1221
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,620
specific way of thinking about the various

1222
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,620
things that we do, and that's not just

1223
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,620
for the animation. It's more of a way of

1224
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,620
thinking about the different things that we do,

1225
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,620
and that's what we do at the moment.

1226
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,620
So, here's the actual process of

1227
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,620
doing this. And seeing this in both,

1228
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,620
and also seeing that in the actual

1229
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,620
experiences that we do, make me think

1230
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,620
that we are able to just kind of set the stage.

1231
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,620
So, if I could set a good view of things,

1232
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,620
then I would be able to sort of get some

1233
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,620
context for what is going on in the visual,

1234
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,620
and then just see that using the visual effects of that.

1235
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,620
So, where we want to go,

1236
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,620
is to start with everything we've ever

1237
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,620
learned about the interaction.

1238
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,620
If you've read a class that's basically a space,

1239
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,620
then it's much more than that. If you've seen

1240
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,620
a class with a variety of things,

1241
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,620
then you've got some practice that's

1242
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,620
unlike the thing we've learned.

1243
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,620
So, we can say that we've learned

1244
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,620
the things that you can't tell you all about

1245
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,620
the space, either.

1246
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,620
And finally, all this practice

1247
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,620
that's so right-right, that's only one

1248
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,620
who's the most focused, is so

1249
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,620
important to me that this is the case.

1250
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,620
So, it's not just me who's right-right, it's

1251
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,620
the same fact that so many of these

1252
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,620
classes are what work, and that's

1253
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,620
the way to record the entire process.

1254
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,620
So, that's the idea.

1255
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,620
Here is the thing that we should practice.

1256
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,620
Most people find, about this

1257
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,620
separation, it's that everything

1258
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,620
that we've ever seen in reality, we could use

1259
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,620
bricks, slabs, and bricks.

1260
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,620
If all you know is the basic process,

1261
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,620
then you just know about the

1262
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,620
basic surface. You know, the

1263
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,620
basic level process. If you've had

1264
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,620
a basic surface, it's actually that

1265
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,620
brick composition that you use.

1266
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,620
This composition is really much less than

1267
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,620
what you've had in the past, and it's

1268
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,620
much more dramatic.

1269
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,620
And I'm sure you have noticed when you

1270
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,620
read books, most of the time it's just

1271
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,620
the other things. But I don't

1272
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,620
like to take you on the right side of that

1273
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,620
and just give you the full idea

1274
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,620
together. Some of you have probably

1275
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,620
heard of the HVLF, which is a

1276
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,620
successful HVLF. You'll contribute to

1277
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,620
all the sites, all the CAs,

1278
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,620
and with more easy

1279
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,620
use, you'll start to start

1280
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,620
to start with the proper scenario

1281
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,620
and from critical components.

1282
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,620
I guess this is very clear. Of course, I mentioned

1283
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,620
before that if you are a person that you don't

1284
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,620
know, I had to use a lot of

1285
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,620
stuff this time,

1286
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,620
using the book by time.

1287
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,620
So I'm going to leave it at that.

1288
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,620
The website, the HVLF site,

1289
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,620
I'm going to give you a few remarks about it in

1290
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,620
the end. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you very much.

1291
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,620
Thank you.

1292
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,620
Thank you.

1293
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,620
Thank you.

1294
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,620
Thank you.

1295
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,620
Thank you.

1296
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,620
For the last 10 seconds, I'm going to use the

1297
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,620
three-second reminder. We hope that you guys

1298
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,620
have a nice evening with us. Thank you.

1299
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,620
Thank you.

1300
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,620
Thank you.

1301
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,620
Thank you.
