1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
community.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you, great job, thank you.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:19,240
Next, we know the intimidated reasons to take an action test is because the

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:26,000
it has got sense of

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,540
How do I get the한테 sesi out of the company who were married together?

6
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,240
That's it and I'm pretty sure we didn't hear it somewhere else.

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,380
Let's find a way of ngling as soon as we can get especiall enough.

8
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,340
archetype inability appears in server management.

9
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,440
Is it about exitism?

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,640
I the system in your program...

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,540
I created the utility emulation diploma.

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,340
And the connection to stay in control.

13
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,980
Iisted road in northern Italy, a small town still there.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,680
So I think it's the most important experience.

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,480
It's your experience.

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,680
It's the most important experience.

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,720
I would say, I think it's the most important experience.

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,960
It's the most interesting experience.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,000
I think it's the most interesting experience.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,800
So thank you very much for the good news.

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,600
But some of you from my community,

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,000
we're going to move into the next phase.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,560
And I'm going to move into the next phase.

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,000
So I'm going to get back to the break.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,960
So I'm going to switch sides.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,280
Now, let's focus on my comments again.

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,360
And it's really interesting.

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,080
And I think one of the things I need to do

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,040
is bring tears to eyes when kalking on this.

30
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,000
For example, it just happens to be that every day we

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,380
get a induced dreams pack of people,

32
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,140
but it always grows.

33
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,200
And theseани are just the Cubs, the comfort

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,060
cyclists and the whether we will do this

35
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,240
for a fully PCOS Devil Gender.

36
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,840
The thing that Waterloo needs to do is to also

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,040
get you guys to talk about your thoughts

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,680
about what you think about Minecraft.

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:13,520
of the

40
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:27,700
this pilot arm too.

41
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:35,160
This planet here.

42
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,720
and he officials wants toyard mean to do engraving racism Square

43
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:59,300
arsons or

44
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,640
where all we're talking about is Beginnings,

45
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,360
but the real reason we're focussing

46
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,760
is especially on advanced learning,

47
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,000
the likeed word it's actually very unique.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,600
Where clear it's a team already made for classmates

49
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,920
who exist pretty fast,

50
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,540
which is likely a little too trusting

51
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,200
so%isation of many of them mostly

52
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
contract employees,

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,580
people getJobs,

54
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,940
and get here,

55
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,040
a Kingsway Board of their boys seems like its the same thing.

56
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,160
One thing we can touch them with a真的很 interesting

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,120
put them in pre- Standing forward

58
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,040
and necessity to communicate each other.

59
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,360
And it's great in other ways to identify

60
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,460
the other's differences.

61
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,100
The two things we covered today

62
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,460
is a surprise to the students

63
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,520
students responded to each of us

64
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,680
we'd like to take a website

65
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,000
which we might get to go deeper into

66
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,760
oral science, so there's a website

67
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:42,840
Now, a page can be imported

68
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,500
Now, a page can be imported

69
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,120
which is fun to play

70
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,120
to add people to it

71
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,520
series makes it a lot more questions

72
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,200
that we're talking about

73
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,800
and that's why we found it

74
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,720
the concept that we were constellations

75
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,200
wasn't You know,

76
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,200
So, it's a good trick to use.

77
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,200
But for me, it's not going to be a trick, it's not that.

78
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,200
It's not going to be a system. So, it's a thing that I'm going to be using in the future.

79
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,200
It's a bug, it's a trick that I'm going to be using in the future.

80
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,200
And I think that's probably the first thing.

81
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,200
And you will see that in the future.

82
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,200
The value of the language that I'm going to be using in the future is going to be

83
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,200
its best friends, which I think has always been important.

84
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
How to use it in your training.

85
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,200
And to try and look deeper into how to use it this way.

86
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,200
And some��other things that you will notice.

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,200
And we use symptoms in testing.

88
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,200
We use the facts of all our actions, what cause and effect,

89
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,200
and we entering ideas and systems in life, society, and in different vital states.

90
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,640
It's easy to do the same stuff in my book, but we'll get started.

91
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:02,500
I go over my book several times, I rise towards the perspective of fiction checks in a sense

92
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,620
for diaries andirit猜想.

93
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,160
If the developer might be kind enough to jump to updated, straight, queer and just brand

94
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
exists.

95
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,860
hoes about spread about them to the front and attention.

96
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,980
If the interlocutor opens his book to the judge andtable, and he puts the support

97
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:47,060
struggles, lives, leisure, hyper- Southwestern affairs, stimulate

98
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,660
is by using the necessary means

99
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,000
that could intend people to reenter kind of eight hours

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,380
of閃etowns, from a different axis.

101
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,240
It's more like units really vakult

102
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,300
than it's like a platform who's keeping

103
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:12,460
whatever

104
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,280
capacity currently melted that as a create

105
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,720
and to give the advantage.

106
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,060
So, just before I go ahead,

107
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,380
we have some more Catalunya issues

108
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,460
and, Clay, before I talk about them,

109
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,700
I'll start about a really valuable

110
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:26,880
comment from trustee remember,

111
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:35,660
from this

112
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,440
paper you've been giving me.

113
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,920
The flying collaboration

114
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,140
ofкр недer,

115
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:41,900
an awesome job Hells

116
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,320
Cheese,

117
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,760
and, so for those who spot out.

118
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,760
It's about carbon-free specifically as in this case with Hellic mangoes,

119
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,260
but also it's about tribes...

120
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:14,980
...and we Discover that neither the other

121
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,380
like how about we stay at our own expense

122
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,380
for a while.

123
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,300
It's very expensive already.

124
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:31,320
It's having a spare steeper

125
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,680
mobility feeling for everything.

126
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,820
So double im Challenges,

127
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,880
always keep all the tools realized for

128
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,340
happiness in the process.

129
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,340
and the third, special form.

130
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,340
Specialized, I would say, the first, second form,

131
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,340
is the word, special form of the term.

132
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,340
It says that really expressed the desire to be a lawyer

133
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,340
is to make the decision of how to develop it,

134
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,340
how to support it, how to contribute it, and how to use it.

135
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,340
So really, it's just a very expensive form of these questions.

136
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,340
It's very, very specific.

137
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,340
For instance, if I have to go to the legal team

138
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,340
to change the rules, five such terms are so common.

139
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,340
The legal team is a very complicated, very expensive system.

140
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,340
And I'm just going to describe a little bit

141
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,340
what kind of works are on the table,

142
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,340
and what I'm going to show you.

143
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,340
So I'm going to talk about special forms.

144
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,340
I would like to explain to you special forms

145
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,340
that are very, very specific.

146
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,340
And I'm going to show you some examples

147
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,340
of what special forms are.

148
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,340
So we have a lot of different forms.

149
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,340
We have the legal, private, and special form.

150
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,340
We have the special form, and we just bring them up.

151
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,340
Then we have special forms.

152
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,340
I'm going to talk about special forms

153
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,340
that are very, very important for some people.

154
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,340
Of course, there's a lot of special forms

155
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,340
that are very, very specific to the legal system.

156
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,340
For instance, people that are very, very interested in this stuff

157
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,340
are not confident in the law of activity.

158
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,340
There's lots of different forms that are in place,

159
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,340
and they can be very, very simple.

160
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,340
As well as the information,

161
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,340
places that are not projected on board,

162
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,340
or that are set up for review,

163
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,340
visualizing stuff that is very, very solid,

164
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,340
and you can see there that you've got added classes

165
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,340
to make the process disaster compared

166
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,340
to when you had those classes or some public schools

167
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:34,340
that were under certain trained坐

168
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,340
was finding that ANY Tom Ford pilot

169
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,340
involved this kind of creative mini personality

170
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:58,220
arsonism and a higher number of tenant boundaries and

171
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,380
So you treat him as a relative, not a father,

172
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,180
but a relative, a big brother,

173
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,460
so you're talking about a relative,

174
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,860
and he was this great little brother,

175
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,260
and so he's a very, very nice guy.

176
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,620
It's just a straight aspect,

177
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,060
and we're not being in consideration of

178
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,700
how we would like him to be in the country,

179
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,980
just for the sake of that,

180
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,260
but we would just say that he's a great guy.

181
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,380
And then you talk about some things that he's been interested in.

182
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,060
And then I started working with him,

183
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,100
and I was in the first round of meetings,

184
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,340
and we were working on some things.

185
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,540
One, he was very interested in this,

186
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,380
but one thing that wasn't very good,

187
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,100
and I think that was an accurate thing,

188
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,220
and I just really watched the film,

189
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,700
because I was kind of in the next room,

190
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,220
and my favorite was this guy,

191
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,100
and he was a great guy.

192
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,180
And then the second round,

193
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,660
and I was pretty clear at the beginning,

194
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,740
and it was the clean, strict policies

195
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,300
that made him feel just very strong,

196
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,900
and it was the clean, strict policies

197
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,100
that were strong, and it was one of the things

198
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,060
that was popular in the States,

199
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,020
and it was very popular in the United States.

200
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,780
Well, yes, they knew Jesus

201
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,300
were not a沒關係,

202
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,700
but they knew how to be a good spouse,

203
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,820
but they knew that, I think,

204
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,940
was a very, very nice word to use.

205
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,900
most of his companions were, I think,

206
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,260
not pray menses, but very known yorkers.

207
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,860
They loved to read the public for the same reasons.

208
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,500
And, one of the many facts about Jesus

209
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,420
was that Spec equation made sense against rainbowes,

210
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,620
and yet that they believed in miracles

211
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,340
was one of the first szcz eher14s.

212
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,740
It's very easy.

213
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,900
And this could be a piece of the discovery

214
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,700
that was very simple

215
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,820
inhabited through the

216
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:37,020
one youжras.

217
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:49,600
The

218
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,760
Dunno, to this extent, that's called settling money.

219
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,400
I agree the same thing that's being said.

220
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,140
It's a simple check and tourist but to all of us who are building

221
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,220
the neighborhood flat, would it be?

222
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,520
I totally agree with you.

223
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,060
It's a very Ryersonian app ponies.

224
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,620
Definitely, we could be najwięces closer or even further up

225
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,200
than so many differentups.

226
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
So, a quick touch on that.

227
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
drawing back your experiences.

228
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,500
appealing still remains advanced as opposed to a previously

229
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:43,100
ид nar experimental overview ofання

230
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,080
It was more effective and intense.

231
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,840
So, there's a pilot image of it in the Straits.

232
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,000
When we go into the fluid Oakland here,

233
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,760
I've hardly ever seen any traces wander

234
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:07,720
So, the astronauts'śnie actually

235
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,440
are you don't find anything.

236
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,640
A project that.

237
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,800
This report is primarily just a small example,

238
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,420
just that it is no intention to prevent due to issues.

239
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,440
See Chicago age is 2.6% in 10 years,

240
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,180
state googles are maybe even 3.8%.

241
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,360
Is my teacher's highest standard degree,

242
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,880
try to participate,

243
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,920
I have a double per cent opportunity

244
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:35,020
for the

245
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,720
of that age,

246
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,360
which it's very, very fair.

247
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,640
You can just me,

248
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,100
and sort of choosing a different option to get

249
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,360
out of this.

250
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
And we uh remembered it about 5 years ago

251
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,460
about this particular one.

252
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,360
We're on the path of planet Earth right now.

253
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,220
And I think like fellow people who got there

254
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,520
didn't give it the full answer quite

255
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,740
as it is.

256
00:13:50,740 --> 00:14:02,220
Why general, ever think a pier疫ate

257
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,540
intellectual sand doing the math,

258
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,160
its time to begin thinking about incredibly

259
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:24,260
of where the

260
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:32,860
We call minorityism the

261
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,460
Tonings says that they aren't all as satisfied as you may think,

262
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,160
in terms of a client being so grinding on what he's doing

263
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,100
just��라 es el del honor,

264
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,480
to not get a obligation or the option of being dominant

265
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,820
in the conditions and those circumstances

266
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,180
that will somewhere in the system.

267
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,260
So socks as bollocks must be protein tozzins.

268
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:56,380
And the company we run cares about getting every daily

269
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,400
little benefit with boot camps,

270
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,880
speedings,

271
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,620
provides us with those kinds of things.

272
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,040
utlich, but our customers very much need

273
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,480
to simply start clinging as better and sounder

274
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,640
as possible.

275
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,220
Y'know, young prescription Energy

276
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:26,780
simply needs to be a lot harder to

277
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,680
take that video and paste that with the audio.

278
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,460
think that it principles the cryptocurrency terms of the 50s.

279
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,660
The private sector, in its first carbonたs in around 150 years,

280
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:42,280
and the S أي Jayiren kind of

281
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,560
you know, because that's one we have here and it's very precious

282
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,040
and we're just talking about a few peanuts that we okay now

283
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,440
I'm going to spend some time talking about some of these things.

284
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,800
Although Thomas Sirupliers is now leverage of a larger concentration of minority они

285

who've been haver observant ofϸākamā in hisامāshisākyāmā Phys Burton, is an

286
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:14,800
치를 put Imma closing lecture with this, we want to demolish the

287
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,120
student steps and I think that everybody is that we've done three steps during our

288
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,640
tonight's evening and this is on top of a big content and about nine of which

289
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,920
are those high school reports find very difficult to achieve, but you're putting

290
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,960
of technology boy that goes ass in the news and just salt

291
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,900
comes back to spick it up in the face on some coordinates.

292
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,480
The guy specified super side with Biraz React

293
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,660
so it's better than what you've done.

294
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,200
So there's the engine version of this.

295
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,500
It's an ongoing cycle of Hey, now we're

296
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,620
going to start with super data.

297
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,840
So when you create SWIFT, I guess what they devices

298
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,360
ichip the mirror, advantage your digital

299
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,560
drivers but the limit to this configuration

300
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:03,600
with

301
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:20,360
with

302
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,480
into monitor�. But that let's make sense because

303
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,220
admire is mostly 3800 and subscribe.

304
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,580
And for those who agree, lunar security does get bigger, so they just become more responsible

305
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,920
They think mass traditionalism,TESOKO will ethics poisoning, healthcare, South Korea,

306
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,200
you shouldn't buy that advertising to protect yourself against it.

307
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,220
It's out there on social networks at Twitter.

308
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:48,760
采访可以使用Hey

309
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,760
So it's the place we want to put our words for the international companies,

310
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,760
the industry and the public sector.

311
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,760
And it's all that we do in this country for the benefit of the world.

312
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,760
And we're not just going to use it, it's not, it's not just a bunch of expensive individuals.

313
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,760
And we are not just going to use it for the benefit of the world,

314
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,760
it's not just a bunch of expensive individuals, it's the interest of the courts,

315
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,760
the institutions, the public services, the institutions of the public,

316
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
and the private industry for the benefit of the public.

317
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,760
So it's the interest of the industry in this country,

318
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
and that's what we're going to use.

319
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,760
And that's what we're going to use.

320
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,760
And I'm sure you'll understand what I mean.

321
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
So it's the interest of the public, it's the same concept,

322
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,760
the case is a trip for the public,

323
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,760
the market is a trip for the public,

324
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
the market is a trip for the industry,

325
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,760
the industry is a trip for the organizations,

326
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,760
the industry is a trip for the companies,

327
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,760
so I have no other words.

328
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,760
But the travel is the release of the important public interest,

329
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,760
the goal of public interest, a lot of these tips,

330
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,760
very interesting examples for the face,

331
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,760
so I want to just slide through the books a little bit.

332
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,760
The European Parliament sent in the first pork Separations lean over from the!)

333
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,760
The meat sam Burns and six other countries is a small bit henceforth

334
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:11,760
because you haven't seen in the second election the snitching of pictures.

335
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,760
There's no perspective of page Anthony dzievits on in this book.

336
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,160
And the one that I worked for was the one that I worked for called Towson.

337
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,360
And it's a more dramatic movie than I thought it was.

338
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,440
It's a story that I've never heard of in my life.

339
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,640
And I think that it's a good one.

340
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,160
It's a lot of sense to follow.

341
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,760
It's a very graphic, very fancy story.

342
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,240
It's a music-driven journey, it's a fun one.

343
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,360
And I like this one a lot, too, because it's very telling.

344
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,840
It's a very romantic and a very interesting movie.

345
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,360
It's a story that functions in a very, very fun way.

346
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,240
It's a bit dramatic.

347
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,360
It's a very interesting movie.

348
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,760
It's a very emotional movie.

349
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,960
It's a very interesting story.

350
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,000
My focus for the rest of the film is to imagine sort of

351
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,040
what is going to happen when the film is finished,

352
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,200
the film that comes out.

353
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,240
And I think that the idea is that it's the movie.

354
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,200
You'll call it the first film, which is quite simple.

355
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,160
That's the movie, the first movie.

356
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
But that's the movie.

357
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,560
And I think that that is a very good one.

358
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,640
It's a very interesting movie.

359
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,560
It's a very nice story.

360
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,560
It has a very interesting and very funny story.

361
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,440
It's a very interesting movie.

362
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,040
It's a very interesting movie.

363
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
It's a very nice story.

364
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,920
It's got families, it's a very nice movie.

365
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,720
It's a very interesting movie, I think.

366
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,640
It's got the character of a young expectant,

367
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,840
is a very funny movie.

368
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,840
And in my opinion, it's the best movie I've ever seen.

369
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,440
It's the best movie I've ever seen.

370
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,440
But it's also very interesting.

371
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,040
It's the greatest movie I've ever seen.

372
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,440
It's got the first day of experience.

373
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
It's a very good movie.

374
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,240
It's a quick given, it's a very good movie.

375
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
It's got a very funny story.

376
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,920
It's a very nice movie.

377
00:20:42,920 --> 00:21:04,200
how yours seems to comply with a drive.

378
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,080
He gives us a quick example because I feel that is something

379
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,360
that we sometimes romanticize in our ways.

380
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,860
Since we used to have thisrey Bhagover that is very

381
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,300
famous for distracted drinks.

382
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,120
Uhh you perform this roundviolent violence.

383
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,160
So even by thinking of leafletrins, as communication

384
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,500
because you have that nature for them and most of

385
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,320
themami, when they drink too fast in beer, that's

386
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,400
what they get, they'll get wine.

387
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,000
But it is something that we just listen to.'s

388
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,200
times over it is bigger times than what

389
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,840
we'd wish for if it was over 50.

390
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,080
So as I said, the reason we start talking about

391
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,640
So, that's the end of the system.

392
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,360
So, we want to talk a little bit about the companies

393
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,400
that have been advantageous to us.

394
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,480
That's a state-based company.

395
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,040
That's a non-independent company.

396
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,400
That's a non-business company.

397
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,200
That's a private company.

398
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,080
That's a private business.

399
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,280
We need to talk some more to the companies.

400
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,200
The other companies that are not private companies,

401
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,240
the companies that are not private,

402
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,840
should be able to survive, for example,

403
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,280
a year after the pandemic.

404
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,480
So, I think this is a good story.

405
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,720
I think that social bonds are a good foundation

406
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,000
for the Channel 1things to win reverse winnings.

407
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,600
All right.

408
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,320
So, if you might like to update your Ann��터 to that

409
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,800
a little bit.

410
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,120
Just make sure that this automatic system

411
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,560
is being integrated enough within your company

412
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,040
to be ins哈囉 anatomy specialists to do it.

413
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,080
How do you know you're going to have a cancer cases in 24 hours?

414
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,520
So, perhaps two of those figures in the program

415
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,600
of the year that you really don't like

416
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,840
sino trauma trends,

417
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,920
you're going to have those high cases of cancer Cela.

418
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,200
So, people have thought of a new contain変camper.

419
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,000
What did it do?

420
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,320
What did it do?

421
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,320
It kind of 바 tiring.

422
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:46,160
.

423
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,160
As I said, as a college graduate, I'm a graduate of the University of New York.

424
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
The New York University is quite a big responsibility.

425
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,160
We have a professional institute in the College of History,

426
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,160
a great university, and a lot of scholarships.

427
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,160
We are excited about the school of scholarship.

428
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
So, it's very special to be able to do these two things.

429
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
For example, we're going to do some scholarship for the college of history.

430
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
So, that's the first step.

431
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
The first step is to get the scholarship.

432
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Second, the first step is to get the scholarship for the college of history.

433
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,160
And finally, the second step is to get the scholarship.

434
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,160
So, it's quite a challenge to be able to do the scholarship.

435
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,160
We've got trance,

436
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,160
we've got trance, we've got trance,

437
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
we've got trance, we've got trance, we've got trance,

438
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,160
and then you start to introduce scholarship as the process.

439
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,160
But you want to ensure that you have the right amount of money

440
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,160
and the right amount of history.

441
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,160
That's what we want to be.

442
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
And we've got to do that sort of process.

443
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,160
That's what we want to do.

444
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
And that's what we want to do.

445
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,160
So, it's a very important thing for the university

446
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
to do, and to do it, and to do it, and to do it.

447
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
And that's the most important thing for the university

448
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,160
to do, is to do the scholarship.

449
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,160
You're going to do the scholarship for the college of history,

450
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,160
and you're going to do the scholarship for the college of history.

451
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,160
The other way for the state to do it is to have the position

452
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,160
of the university to do it.

453
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,160
So, rather than the actual scholarship,

454
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,160
you're going to do the scholarship.

455
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,160
Step number five.

456
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,160
So, I've already spoken about this before.

457
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,160
Step number five.

458
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,160
Step number six.

459
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,160
Step number seven.

460
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
The first step of the study is that one or two

461
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:20,160
eight years ofはるまらん 21st century

462
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,160
시� motherfucker studies college of history.

463
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,160
NO POSSIBILITY

464
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,160
these are panels that we have from about

465
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
in the thirty years,

466
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,680
bikes for 1000 people a year especially since an industrial single bike project or oneots

467
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,520
race Koreans are facilitating developing what we do and everyone is very skillful and

468
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:49,480
I would like to add to that the fact that in order to strengthen our building although

469
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:58,280
it's more scintless but there's also От excited about it and a great amount we have

470
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,400
almost constructed more systems already.

471
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:27,660
That it is our university's right to adjust its

472
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,660
and what's been happening in the last few weeks

473
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,660
in the United States, and the United States

474
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,660
has been doing some really good things

475
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,660
in terms of the way that we're doing things

476
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,660
in the United States.

477
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,660
And I thought we should probably

478
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,660
try to understand the fact that

479
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,660
the United States is a country that

480
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,660
has been affected by the pandemic.

481
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,660
It is a country that has been very, very

482
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,660
affected by the pandemic, and it's

483
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,660
a country that's been affected by the pandemic.

484
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,660
What this means is that the pandemic

485
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,660
has been a very difficult time for us

486
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,660
to understand across the country,

487
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,660
and to learn about all the organizations

488
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,660
in the United States that we have

489
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,660
infiltrated across the globe.

490
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,660
so that way I could

491
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,900
provide you with some Home fallen

492
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,660
history.

493
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,900
So it's been a very, very difficult

494
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,660
and difficult time in Vietnam to

495
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,660
learn about the pressures that

496
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,460
were achterwe sauteed on purpose.

497
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,460
Spe até now, we have prophesied

498
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,600
many receiving this disease,

499
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,600
And so we have to try to work with the communities

500
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
to get the children into the world to talk about that.

501
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
So we're working with the communities

502
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,600
to get them into the world to talk about that.

503
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
And so we have to try to work with the communities

504
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,600
to get the children into the world to talk about that.

505
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
So we're working with the communities

506
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,600
to get them into the world to talk about that.

507
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,600
And so we have to try to work with the communities

508
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
to talk about that.

509
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
And so we have to work with the communities

510
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
to get them into the world to talk about that.

511
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,100
And so we're working with the communities

512
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,600
to get them into the world to talk about that.

513
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
And so we have to try to work with the communities

514
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,600
to get them into the world to talk about that.

515
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Yeah, thank you, wall, to the board of directors.

516
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,600
Emilio fueli is this man.

517
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Are you here to speak to the board?
