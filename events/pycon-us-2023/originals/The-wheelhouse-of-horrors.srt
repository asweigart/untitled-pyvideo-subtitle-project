which is biased found within the

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,980
United Kingdom and

test it until.♪

16
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
And we promised our

contract.

18
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,580
We said that we would

20
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:05,520

on the

24

27
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,540
before I present some of my esas.

28
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,520
There's nothing special in a person's life.

29
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,620
Nothing of any flap that belongs to the egg,

30
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,920
to the tenth whicht third is the nest.

31
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,340
Look this way, old way,

32
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,340
on the olde truss slam until I could not figure it out.

33
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,160
On the olde time, also there is a late one by now.

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,840
Pretty much same one field you probably looked at

35
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,180
when you were over.

36
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,300
presentations their

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,400

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,940
moves

39
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,980
the

40
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,060
his

41
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,060
him

42
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,060
'm

43
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,860
is for those of you who have ever something on a stop sign,

44
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,860
what exactly is your stop sign in this building?

45
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,800
For people of high school,

46
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,400
working fewer sets of hands for more work to buy bread

47
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,940
has become become a big change

48
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,900
very often it's by the people of the United States series.

49
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,540
It has become a major social phenomenon

50
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,200
that every worker wants to raise.

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,020
During the plundering process

52
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,640
kids usually come back in the root of the leaf

53
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,820
before it's re- puffed and worn,

54
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:46,220
several institutions began to see big increases in pay.

55
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:46,720
So that established a SA,

56
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,920
and put an end to the Domestic комprésigension of角 creepers and

57
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:04,380
the

58
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,620
novel around circum zmianis.

59
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,540
to make the relative code grafer and Weiserberg

property an überசiałataitme

61
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,940
we can do that in many means

62
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,740
as the chord sense

63
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,500
what happened to Plutus

64
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,020
what did Plutus need Not even 중요ities

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,060
printer

66
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,000
so much as can intend

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,200
for the process whichmeden

69
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,360
to not obey the station

70
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,000
we need to maintain

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,480
do not contain

72
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,940
LOL

73
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,480
from today this case

74
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,580
Man氣就从市面啦,

75
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,180
But if you there's things that go intooulding,

76
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,120
you know you punch the thin tips,

77
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,960
so the burying ofем自己

78
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,520
is the most straightforward type of

79
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,680
education goes through.

80
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,740
There's a difference,

81
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,940
there's like a certain mix,

82
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,120
yeah, in the observed,

83
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,160
and it's neverんな,

84
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,680
which is so you have to use

85
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,880
the good Grand Passues

86
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,520
after your experiences

87
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,700
and in some cases,

88
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,100
you have to put out a good hand

89
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,420
and you can get your best few bags

90
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,100
he will be meaning 아니, for you it doesn't,

91
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,060
probably one day his thoughts will also give way

92
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,820
to the

93
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,420
base of the work so

94
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,340
he, trovauf Volvo should be made

95
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,420
an idyllic model

96
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,500
that will affect some of his

97
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,660
something and

98
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,820
mantas

99
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,820
that are fructs

100
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,500
had his boat

101
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,420
that

102
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,140
that costs

103
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,620
so

104
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,060
it's a

105
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,500
treat

106
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,100
but maybe

107
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,620
it's an

108
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,500
Thruster

109
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:34,900
that has

110
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,940
total interest

111
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,100
How is

112
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,600
it

113
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:44,120
So you seeICe hurts healing issues, so kids will also learn to worry sometimes.

114
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,520
Together we want we need to do the best we can to cure this problem.

115
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,520
I just want to remind everyone, if you're concerned about your individual needs or something,

116
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,240
that you use both the harmonic GOES and momentic COOPLY,

117
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,240
And that is why I have this question that I don't really get.

118
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,240
But the thing is, I'm interested in the idea that it is

119
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,240
truly important that we have the current effect.

120
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
So this is why I have the idea to make that.

121
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,240
So I found out that if you define the second part,

122
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
then you don't have to make those two parts.

123
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,240
And that is the common idea behind that.

124
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,240
And I think that is the way that it's going to work.

125
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,240
And I think that is the way that this machine works.

126
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
And I think that is the way that we can try to get the best

127
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,240
possible results in the end here.

128
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
And that is the way to do it for a bit.

129
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Because I think that is the way that it is going to work.

130
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,240
And I think that it is true for others.

131
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,240
And that is the way to do it.

132
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
So I have a question here.

133
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,240
And this question is, is that true or just being more true?

134
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,240
And I think that is the way that it is going to work.

135
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,240
And I think that is the way that you can do it.

136
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,240
And check that you don't necessarily just change the way

137
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
that you consider that is how we absorb.

138
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:10,240
I mean H2 smells just fine too.

139
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
What I tend to say.

140
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
What I tend to tell them.

141
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,240
and be like this,

142
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
I would be using my feet

143
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
if I had to be going into the night

144
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
and see people, the dead bodies.

145
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
So it is, it is also very easy,

146
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,240
but it is also very, very difficult.

147
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
It's hard.

148
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,240
So, when you have to come,

149
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,240
you have to find other places.

150
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
There are some places, and

151
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
there are some places

152
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
where it's hard to engage with something,

153
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
where you're not,

154
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,240
like, just going into the night, it's fixed.

155
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
So, it's very difficult to engage with something,

156
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
because you're not going into the night,

157
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
you're not going into the night, it's fixed.

158
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
And then you can also ask,

159
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
if it's tough,

160
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
try this,

161
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,240
and find other places where it's not so hard.

162
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
And I've tried this,

163
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
it's a very specific process,

164
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
but that can be a person that's at the moment

165
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,240
in this case,

166
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
or they're at the moment in this case,

167
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,240
and then the problem is,

168
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
so, if you're going to ask,

169
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
if you're going to be teaching,

170
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
the kind of goals that you're going to be teaching,

171
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240
especially to other people,

172
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
so that's not only the case,

173
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
but also,

174
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
that's not going to be an easy thing,

175
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
and it's not going to be just

176
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
if I'm teaching,

177
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,240
and it's not going to be easy.

178
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,240
So, that's basically the specifications.

179
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
So, it becomes,

180
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
with the old method,

181
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
it just becomes simple to you.

182
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
So, I guess,

183
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
this is something I know,

184
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,240
that we all need to understand,

185
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
and that's why I needed these,

186
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
because I understand

187
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,240
why it is so important

188
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
to be able to do this,

189
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,240
and so far, I think, it's been.

190
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
It's a lot of work,

191
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,240
and it's a lot of work,

192
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
but it's not only depending on how you do it,

193
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
but it's not only depending on how you do it,

194
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,240
and I think that's probably the only difference

195
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
between the simple,

196
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
simple, and simple way to practice

197
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,240
some of the things we can skip this.

198
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
So, that's the first one.

199
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,240
The first one is the key one,

200
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,240
and it's the one that you can control from the beginning.

201
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,240
So, that's the second,

202
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
for example, the first example.

203
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
And the second one is actually that,

204
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
that's the one that I understand,

205
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,240
and I have some years of experience

206
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,240
in trying to get the best possible

207
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
out of the game,

208
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
so it's something that's not going to be easy,

209
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
but you get the best of the time,

210
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,240
and it becomes easier to Student Power.

211
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,240
So then, the third one

212
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,240
is the only one that you can change.

213
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
You can diverge from the one

214
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
that you can totally find your way

215
00:09:46,240 --> 00:10:02,240
because you don't need

216
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,820
Remember our first choke event?

217
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,680
I'm a human being.

218
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,680
So, then there was a Holders Blend-C

219
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,660
and something about Laurie's is why it include them.

220
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,180
So,備

221
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,620
just a moment.

222
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,220
You have kind of a strength barrier

223
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,360
sort of sophisticated

224
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,960
Norman LOLerna

225
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,060
then after your full trial session

226
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,600
and so it's gonna have the same kind of

227
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,240
a massive, specific range of

228
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:54,320
on the new

229
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,440
and this is something that I'm here today

230
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,320
not for to the publishing industry.

231
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,560
So I've been trying to find the answers

232
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,800
to the questions that you asked

233
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,800
and it's only been five years, maybe less.

234
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,960
And I've been trying to find the answers

235
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,720
to the questions that you asked.

236
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,360
The first one is about the cost.

237
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,880
The cost of the computer is the cost of the computer

238
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,800
to download.

239
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,640
And the second one is actually the cost of the computer

240
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,360
to download the experience.

241
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,080
You can just say that the computer is the only thing

242
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,280
that you can do.

243
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,960
And I've found that the computer is the only thing

244
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,240
that you can do to manage your experience.

245
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,720
And the third one is the cost of the computer

246
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,520
is the cost of your agency.

247
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,320
And the fourth one is about the cost.

248
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,600
Maybe I haven't talked about it,

249
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,520
but I've been trying to find the answers.

250
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,880
So the first one is about the cost.

251
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,160
The second one is about the cost.

252
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,960
The third one is about the dependency.

253
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,600
The answer is that the cost of the computer

254
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,640
is basically the cost of your business

255
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,320
and it's called time-ara.

256
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,440
The time-ara thing where the time hotel

257
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,040
is

258
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,520
credit card reader,

259
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,200
assistant of the posting agency,

260
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,040
and that they don't have a computer.

261
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,480
So they're not trying to go into heaven

262
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,880
and let you fight for the dependency itself.

263
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,560
And they are toating for your organization

264
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,560
and Raider for yourgirlfriend or subscribe.

265
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,240
The answer to the first one is also

266
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,400
to look at the maintain amount of the appropriate

267
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,960
River vision

268
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,000
For all they know, I do

269
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,020
Medicine

270
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,860
Wanted

271
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:38,560
Their

272
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,680
Before we start writing it, you have to think about your structure first.

273
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,480
Ask yourself.

274
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,720
If I was in the bike park with a car with a espero right in front of me,

275
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,640
I guess I could find aAK ZO at first.

276
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:59,620
Because I didn't feel like I had to use the

277
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,300
ramen Ω.

278
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,640
How I get my stuff ready and I only have the notes oh,

279
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,920
I have to feel like I'm getting it's outside my Brahms.

280
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,920
And I just know it's a kind of a factor for the community that I was born in.

281
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,920
And that's one of the reasons.

282
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,920
And I think that when you start with a search,

283
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,920
following the search for examples,

284
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,920
the kind of things that you can see that you can be found in

285
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,920
which is really formative energies.

286
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,920
And you know, some people say that

287
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,920
it's because they're in the blinding that stations

288
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,920
or that they're in this environment.

289
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,920
But it's also because the search won't be made

290
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,920
in the sense that the

291
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,920
in the sense that the identity of the universe is superfluous.

292
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,920
And so I would not agree with that idea that

293
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,920
when you start with a search, you will also get to the search for you.

294
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,920
And then back to the idea that you need to be able to find

295
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,920
the things that you can't find in the station.

296
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,920
You might not be able to find the things that you can't find.

297
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,920
So, the first thing that I would say is that

298
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,920
the first thing that I would say is that

299
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,920
the first thing that you can see that you can do

300
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,920
is that you can do is go and search it.

301
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,920
Why? Because it's not enough.

302
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,920
And you might not be able to find things that you can use.

303
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,920
You might not be able to find things that you can use.

304
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,920
And that's not going to be a difference

305
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,920
in the other specific things that you can do.

306
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,920
And that's actually not something that the senior section of the U.N.A.

307
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,920
is going to be able to do because

308
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
when the formal dress of the service is in the classroom,

309
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
the sophisticated facility is going to be coming to you

310
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,920
and you need to find it in the future.

311
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,920
And that's the only way that you can do it.

312
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,920
So, I think that's the only way that I would say

313
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
that I would actually agree with that idea.

314
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
The only thing that I would agree with is that

315
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,920
basically you don't need to go to the service

316
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
and you need to go to the station to go

317
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,920
and you need to go to the service to get the break.

318
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
So, I think the only difference that we can do

319
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
is also because you can use the terminal

320
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
in the old and new west.

321
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,920
And you can go to the west and you can see the new services.

322
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,920
Okay. So, the first thing I would say is

323
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
I'm going to search for identity.

324
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
I'm going to search for myself.

325
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
And I'm going to go to the office and I'm going to see

326
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,920
if I can get my information released.

327
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,920
So, why is that so different?

328
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,920
So, the first thing I would say is

329
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,920
to go to the office and go to the office.

330
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
And I would say this might be a system

331
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,920
that's also a good example of how you can use

332
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
the information on the internet.

333
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
And I would say that's not only a good model.

334
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,920
It's a very different way of getting all your data

335
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,920
from different countries

336
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
or the different places you can stuff in the internet.

337
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
So, you can have your data in your wallet,

338
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
use the data from the system,

339
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,920
and it's going to be good.

340
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,920
And I think that's the only difference I would say.

341
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,920
In terms of the system,

342
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,920
it's not only a good service.

343
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,920
It's a good model.

344
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
It's a good way of getting your information released.

345
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
But, then again,

346
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,920
it's a good example.

347
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,920
So, this is kind of my third or sixth

348
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,920
because we don't get complicated.

349
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,920
And I also think that it's a really good

350
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,920
way to solve the second issue,

351
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,920
the independence from the US.

352
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,920
So, in the beginning,

353
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
we talked about using the

354
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,920
not-conceiving algorithms.

355
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
And I think that's very nice.

356
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
I mean, in the end,

357
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,920
it's very important to solve the issues.

358
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,920
And that's what's so important

359
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,920
for the continuing algorithms

360
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,920
for that sort of purpose.

361
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Because the access to the internet

362
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,920
is a key to fighting the crime.

363
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,920
And I think that's the difference

364
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,920
that's so important,

365
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,920
because that's what we're looking at.

366
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
And I think that's the difference

367
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,920
that's so important for the continuing algorithms

368
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,920
is that they're not just

369
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,920
the same as the other systems.

370
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,920
They're the same as the old system.

371
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
Right?

372
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,920
So, the third or sixth

373
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
is the division.

374
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,920
And this is the division of the five units.

375
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,920
It's basically the same division

376
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,920
of the five units, the series of five units,

377
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
or the current division of the five units.

378
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
And this is the division of the five units,

379
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
the divided divisions,

380
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,920
the divided distributions.

381
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
So, the fourth or fifth

382
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,920
is the division of the seven units,

383
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
the two units,

384
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
the three units,

385
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
and the fourth or fifth is the division of the six units,

386
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
the three units,

387
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
the four units,

388
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,920
the five units,

389
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,920
the six units.

390
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
And just outside,

391
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
what's the third or fourth division

392
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,920
of the three units,

393
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,920
the fourth or sixth division

394
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,920
This is to be interesting, learn, to still work in a particular area,

395
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,920
explore new ways to make your work interesting.

396
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,920
And sometimes I want to see the other things that you guys can use to do this.

397
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:05,920
I don't know, from the beginning, to perhaps the kind of the electric theory that works.

398
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,920
So this is what I was trying to find.

399
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,920
I don't know if there is something like this in the electric theory,

400
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,920
or if you can use it in a different way, but it's in the electric theory.

401
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:25,920
So now I'm going to use some of the knowledge I have to look at how I can use it in this field.

402
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,920
And so the first is that I can do the USU at 3 to 14.

403
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,920
And the other thing is that nothing is really going to happen at the moment,

404
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,920
since 17, for course specification.

405
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,920
So that I can do it because if I try to figure out what, for example,

406
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:53,920
if I go back here, you can see that, for example, if you just start to think about what I'm doing here,

407
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:59,920
I'm going to do 17, because the first thing I'm going to do is do it.

408
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,920
And then you see 17 is the first thing I'm going to do, so I'm going to do 17 single-fields.

409
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,920
And I'm going to do it in the sense that I'm going to do something simple.

410
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Essentially it's a control.

411
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:18,920
So you can find all the different levels, from 32, 30, or even 60, depending.

412
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:27,920
So this is kind of the ability of looking at all the spheres to compare it.

413
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,920
And this is variable, maybe 164.

414
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,920
If I want to do it, I can do it here.

415
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,920
Because I'm going to do it in a single-field reverse.

416
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,920
So I'm going to do it in the most independent-oriented species.

417
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:46,920
6, 5, 6, 4, whatever, whatever you want to call it, whatever you want to call it.

418
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,920
And then you see the first thing I'm going to do is do it.

419
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,920
This is the kind of activity that you need in order to get the best out of the different species in the world.

420
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,920
And what else do you need?

421
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Which is just going from changing the angles, to also doing the same things.

422
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,920
The third thing here is a way to get the best out of the different species.

423
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,920
So this is the kind of activity that you need to do to get the best out of the different species in the world.

424
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,920
So, for example, if you want to do it in a single-field reverse,

425
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,920
you need to be stronger, or you need to be more aggressive.

426
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,920
You can also do it in the cross, and this is the way you want to do it.

427
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
It also depends on the species.

428
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,920
So if you want to do it in the cross, or if you want to do it in the single-field reverse,

429
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:35,920
you want to be stronger, because it says the species is also used in the cross, just like the species.

430
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,920
Next, we will talk about Differentav reprodu clapping types.

431
00:20:40,920 --> 00:21:04,460
It is the first type of

little

435
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,660
you

436
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,720

438
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,380
and making an agreement of support to give those

439
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,180
DFCP emailing drivers, as well as support to aircraft metrics

440
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:41,860
to see if they can support persons with other Thermal Disrepair missions.

441
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,020
Just a quick brief overview.

442
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,660
So how was the covert etc.

443
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:54,500
생겼습니다 Ontario AFSF

444
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,900
It's not like the navigation system to room is discovered enfrentily,

445
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,800
even in an actual major language entry level data,

446
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,920
or the system to a widerrafards release,

447
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:20,300
and to allowiz- admins to

448
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,360
use information.

449
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,760
This is a practice.

450
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,480
Our institution, the university,

451
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,760
worked very historically

452
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,280
for the university,

453
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,460
so we presented a page

454
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,580
among the people

455
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,600
to cover this recently company

456
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,660
thatNetwork focus on.

457
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,680
This is part of the

458
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:45,460
written certificate of

459

pregnancy coaching

460
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,160
and it

461
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,900
is the first

462
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,720
degree in our unit

463
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,640
or event

464
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,220
and properly

465
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,700
each 49 years.

466
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,340
Each year

467
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:11,500
With your organizer 5 to 6 years before you spawn, if you had to do the correct

468
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Okay, so how does it all work?

469
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,500
I mean, the thing is, the thing that I really think is complicated,

470
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,500
is that I really think that I just want to be able to show

471
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
just anything that I can.

472
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,500
I just want to be able to show that you can do this,

473
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,500
and I can do that.

474
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
In other words, since you can't see the future,

475
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
you can't see the future.

476
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
So, why is it so funny?

477
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Since it's been almost a year,

478
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,500
I think it's really funny because I've always thought

479
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
that you know there's going to be nowadays,

480
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,500
things you should do, just to be able to be a part of your ecosystem,

481
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
and you should be able to do this.

482
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
So, I think that's why I'm doing this.

483
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
I'm really here for the stages.

484
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
I'm here to take you to the stage,

485
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
and I'm really here to take you to the stage

486
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,500
to be able to do the things you need to do.

487
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
Thank you.
