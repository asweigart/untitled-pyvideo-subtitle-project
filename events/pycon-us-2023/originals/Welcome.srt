1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,080
Thank you.

2
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,760
Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,200
Welcome.

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,680
It is my honor to welcome you to PyCon US 2023 in Salt Lake City.

5
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,260
This year we are celebrating 20 years of PyCon US.

6
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:54,480
So we have planned many special things to commemorate this special occasion.

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,200
And I haven't even been coming to PyCon for that many years.

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,040
I haven't even been using Python for that long.

9
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,360
So I asked for help.

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,360
I asked people to tell us what it was like at earlier PyCons.

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,960
And I asked people to share their photos and memories.

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,320
And thanks to those who have shared their photos and memories with us,

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,920
we were able to compile all of them into a video and a throwback of PyCon US

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,240
for 20 years.

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,240
And it is really my honor to share this video with you for the first time ever.

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,560
So let's take a look at the 20 years of PyCon US throwback.

17
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
Wow.

18
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,960
Isn't that amazing?

19
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,280
Like 20 years of memories, I watched that so many times.

20
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,120
And one thing that strikes me is that you come to PyCon

21
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,760
is not just about R.K.

22
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,560
All of that is about my mom, my level and all of that.

23
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,680
And she's the hostess of that show.

24
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,960
Would you with us, please?

25
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,940
But you see code.

26
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,060
The photos are full of people.

27
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,600
The people you see in the videos are all members of the Python community.

28
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,040
From all over the world come to PyCon.

29
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:41,200
It really gives you an idea of the kind of people who you will be interacting with for

30
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,960
the next few days at PyCon US.

31
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,840
By the way, my name is Marieta.

32
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,520
I'm the conference chair this year.

33
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,040
On social media, you can find me on Mastodon.

34
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,920
That's my handle.

35
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,200
I just want to start by saying thank you.

36
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,240
Thank you to the Python Software Foundation for taking the management and financial responsibility

37
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,400
of this conference.

38
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,680
We really wouldn't be here without its board and staff.

39
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:18,440
And I want to say thank you to PyCon and PSF staff who are helping throughout this conference.

40
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:26,240
And the volunteers.

41
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,960
And for the volunteers, except for about a dozen of PyCon and PSF staff, everyone else

42
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,920
who you see at the registration desk, the green room attendants, session runners, tutorial

43
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,880
hosts, even myself, we are volunteers.

44
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,720
A lot of people have been commenting, wow, I must be so busy running around at the conference,

45
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,120
but really it's not as overwhelming as you think.

46
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,000
And it's really thanks to all the volunteers who have stepped up for doing this.

47
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,360
So thank you so much.

48
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,680
I also want to say thanks to our sponsors.

49
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,520
I know it has been a challenging year this year for tech industry.

50
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,800
The year begins with mass layoffs everywhere.

51
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,360
Companies are restructuring, reprioritizing, changing focus.

52
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,640
I'm grateful that despite all of that, you did not back out.

53
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:33,480
You continued to set a priority in the Python community, continued to support us.

54
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,600
So thank you so much.

55
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,840
Thank you to all the presenters who have come here to share their knowledge and expertise.

56
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:54,480
I'm thankful for all of you for being here, either in person or online.

57
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,480
It really means a lot to us that you have chosen to spend this time with us celebrating

58
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,720
this special occasion.

59
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,160
I feel like we're having a 20-year birthday party with 2,000 people.

60
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
So thank you.

61
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,600
APPLAUSE

62
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,720
Now, to first-time attendees, I want to extend a very special welcome to you.

63
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:28,000
I think it's a very special thing, a magical thing.

64
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,080
I too was a first-time attendee not too long ago.

65
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:39,520
I too was a Python newbie, nobody, and just like you.

66
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:47,640
And my first ever PyCon US was in Montreal 2015.

67
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,800
At that time, really, I was a nobody.

68
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,000
And thanks to the financial aid program from the PSF and the PyLadies that I was able to

69
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,680
attend the conference, it changed my life.

70
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:08,120
At that conference, I saw so many women speakers speaking on stage.

71
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:17,560
And up until then, never in my life I thought this is something I could ever do.

72
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:24,480
Seeing them on stage not only gives me the idea that, oh, this is something I could do,

73
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:33,800
but also it made me believe that it could be done, that one day I could give conference

74
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,800
talk too.

75
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,800
APPLAUSE

76
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,600
And that's really how my ice cream selfie tradition began.

77
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,960
So for those of you who are not familiar, this is like a tradition for me.

78
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,320
It's a reward for myself.

79
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,960
Each time after I give a talk at the conference, I go for an ice cream and take a selfie.

80
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,600
And it turns out I've done so many of them.

81
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,760
And really, I was not exaggerating when I said PyCon US, attending PyCon US changed

82
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,880
my life.

83
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:20,560
It was also during my first PyCon that I really learned about the open source, the community.

84
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,600
I think for the longest time I took Python for granted.

85
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,040
I even thought that Python is like a product of Apple because it's just been there on my

86
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,120
computer.

87
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,240
So when I attended PyCon, first time that's when I really understood, I learned what is

88
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,120
the Python community.

89
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:49,960
I learned the terminologies like open source maintainer, Python core developers.

90
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:56,640
I had no idea what it meant before and I really had no idea that one day I too would become

91
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,560
a Python core developer.

92
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:12,640
I had no idea that one day, you know, instead of sitting there where you are, I'll be up

93
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:18,320
here welcoming you to the 20 years of PyCon US.

94
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,160
So for all of you, all of you attending here for the first time, getting introduced to

95
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,160
PyCon US, really welcome.

96
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:33,360
All I want is for you to have that same experience, that same opportunities that I found here.

97
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,080
I want you to have that magic too here at the magic of PyCon US.

98
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,440
I want you to meet the people, the community who have always been here for me.

99
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,440
They are here for you because you are part of the community too.

100
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,920
So take full advantage of the fact that you are here at the largest Python conference

101
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,360
in the world.

102
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,400
I wish for you to be inspired.

103
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,800
I know you might feel like a newbie today but I really hope by the time you live here,

104
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,720
you live with 2,000 new friends.

105
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,080
So let me now tell you about what's going to happen at PyCon US.

106
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,200
We are in fact on day three of PyCon US.

107
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:20,240
The first two days have passed, all the tutorials, some of the summits.

108
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,240
But as you can see, there are still lots of events waiting for you.

109
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,920
First of all on this stage, we will have four amazing keynote speakers.

110
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:36,040
Ned Batchelder will be here shortly and you will get to hear from James Powell tomorrow,

111
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,580
Margaret Mitchell on Sunday and Carol Willing will give the closing keynote.

112
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,740
We also have a few extra special guests.

113
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:51,400
The Python steering council will be here tomorrow to give their updates about Python and I have

114
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:59,900
invited the creator of Python, Guido van Rassen, to share his retrospective of PyCon US.

115
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:05,140
Even more special guests, we will have the diversity and inclusion panel tomorrow after

116
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,180
the steering council and Deb Nicholson will be here on Sunday to present the community

117
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:16,500
service award and to provide updates from the Python Software Foundation.

118
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,620
You can still sign up for lightning talks.

119
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,420
Lightning talks are five minutes long.

120
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,340
Anyone can do it, even if it's your first time at a conference, even if you've never

121
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:31,700
given any talk before and you can talk about almost literally anything, there is a sign

122
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,460
up board next to the registration desk.

123
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,180
One cool thing about giving lightning talks is that you get to be on the same stage right

124
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,900
here, the same stage as our keynote speakers who will give their talk.

125
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,460
So you will feel fabulous.

126
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:53,340
Now, at the expo hall, that's where we will have our meals, breakfast, and lunch are provided

127
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,020
for the next three days and it's all included in your registrations.

128
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:02,780
Our sponsors have set up their booths at the expo hall and again, really without our sponsors,

129
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,380
our conference would not be as good as you have experienced.

130
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,900
So we're grateful for their continued support.

131
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:16,460
Please go check them out and learn what they have to say and get some swag.

132
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:21,140
At the expo hall is also where you will find our community booths and startup rows and

133
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:26,300
the job fair and posters will also be there on Sunday.

134
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,700
So if you want to see the sponsors and booth, go there today and tomorrow.

135
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,020
On Sunday, same place, it will look totally different for different events.

136
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,940
All right.

137
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:44,460
The charlas are in a new room this year in room 250.

138
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,620
That's upstairs.

139
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,300
And the rest of the talks, it's a little bit of the walk.

140
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:55,860
You need to walk further down to the other side of the conference center.

141
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:03,180
The picture here is really not up to scale the walk to the 255 and 355 is kind of long.

142
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,140
It means take your time.

143
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,980
Don't wait last minute to get to the talks because last year I got turned away from one

144
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,020
of the talks because it was full.

145
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:20,300
I was late.

146
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,660
I should have highlighted this.

147
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,940
Let's go next.

148
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,060
Okay.

149
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:33,940
So this year we actually have 89 talks and five simultaneous tracks including the charlas.

150
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:40,020
And all of these are live streams and recorded and captioned and will be uploaded to YouTube.

151
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,140
I really recommend it.

152
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:49,540
If you are able to go watch the talk in person, after all the lockdowns, I really miss seeing

153
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,380
things in real life.

154
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,540
So go see talks, but don't worry if you miss any of them.

155
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:00,540
They are recorded and you can watch again later.

156
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,780
We also have a quiet room here tucked away at the end of the hallway.

157
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,620
Room can't even read that.

158
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,620
But there is a quiet room.

159
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,940
That's a place where you can rest and relax, take a break.

160
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,460
And it really meant to be quiet in literal sense.

161
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,940
Like quiet, no sounds.

162
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,980
And the lights there were intentionally turned off.

163
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,580
So please don't go in there and start turning on the lights.

164
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,500
And the quiet room is also not an office.

165
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:36,660
If you want to work, you want to take out your laptop, typing, which makes noises, please

166
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,140
do it outside, not in the quiet room.

167
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:47,060
There are several lactation rooms available throughout the venue.

168
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,380
And there is one all gender restroom.

169
00:19:49,380 --> 00:20:03,340
I was told the other one near the expo hall here is no longer an all gender restroom.

170
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,900
And there are a number of elevators around the building.

171
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,780
And the conference center is ADA compliant.

172
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,820
However, if you have any concerns or need additional accommodation, please let one of

173
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,340
the staff members know.

174
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,940
Lost and Found is not at the staff room.

175
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,700
There is an info desk by the registrations.

176
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,660
And also you can also go to the Salt Palace Lost and Found at the guest services office.

177
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,380
They know that if they found something, it might belong to one of our attendees.

178
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,060
So you can check there, too.

179
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:45,980
And at PyCon US, we will be providing live captioning for all the keynote sessions, the

180
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,580
talk tracks and the charlas.

181
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,500
And this year, our live streams are also captioned.

182
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:59,220
So be sure to look for the captioning screen in each room and select a seat in that area

183
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,740
so that the captions will be clear and easily viewed.

184
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:09,220
So I want to say thanks to our captioning sponsors.

185
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,420
The hallway track at PyCon US is a unique feature.

186
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:19,620
I mean, when else are you going to have the opportunity to meet 2,000 people who are just

187
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,180
as enthusiastic about Python as you?

188
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,540
So do take this opportunity to talk to people in the hallway.

189
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:34,180
One thing that could help with socializing in the hallways by following the Pac-Man rule.

190
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:39,860
So the rule is when standing as a group of people, always leave room for one person to

191
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,520
join your group.

192
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:49,360
So this leaving room for new people when standing in a group is a physical way to show

193
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,160
an inclusive and welcoming environment.

194
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:59,080
It gives explicit permission for people to join the group, giving them the opportunity

195
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,040
to integrate into the community.

196
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,960
All right.

197
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,920
Now remember to pick up your swag.

198
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:19,520
So any leftovers that you did not pick up, we will sell them on Sunday, 11 to 1, at the

199
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,800
same place where you do the swag pickup.

200
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,840
By Ladies Auction is coming tomorrow evening.

201
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,120
Room 151 here in this venue.

202
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,000
So I think last year it was a different area.

203
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,640
This time it's right in the building so you don't need to leave.

204
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,800
And open spaces.

205
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:47,400
Open spaces are self-organized meetups that take place in one hour intervals in dedicated

206
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,360
rooms throughout the conference.

207
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:57,280
And these open spaces are really created in real time by you.

208
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,120
So to start an open space, you just need to sign up.

209
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,720
There will be boards across from the staff office.

210
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,240
This year we have our own mobile app.

211
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,440
And it will have lots of information about the conference, all the schedules.

212
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,000
The map will be there too.

213
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,160
It's open source, Apache 2 license.

214
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:30,080
And you can get them by using this, scan this in your mobile phone.

215
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,840
And you can even contribute to it by checking out the GitHub repository.

216
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,680
You can suggest features.

217
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:42,080
You can help fix issues and create your own pull requests.

218
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,640
You can engage, and I do encourage you to do that, engage with us on social media.

219
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,840
Our hashtag is PyCon US.

220
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,880
Hashtag PyCon US.

221
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,280
And now we are on Twitter and we are also on Mastodon.

222
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:03,240
And I learned that the equivalent of hashtags on Mastodon is like groups.

223
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,280
So now there is also a PyCon US group on Mastodon.

224
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:16,600
So if you, in your tweets, if you mention the PyCon US at chirp.social, it will automatically

225
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,800
be boosted by that account.

226
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:27,700
So if you follow this group, you will be seeing lots of PyCon US content.

227
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:38,660
Now let's talk about the health and safety at PyCon US here.

228
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:43,580
You know, in the past year, since I've started helping to organize this conference, I've

229
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,140
been receiving lots of inquiries about PyCon US.

230
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,100
Like many of these are in the line of, do we really still need to be masking at PyCon

231
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,260
US in the year 2023?

232
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:03,820
Now if you want to be here at PyCon US in person and have the opportunity to interact

233
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:11,120
with the amazing Python community here, the answer is yes.

234
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,220
And I want to say thank you to everybody in this room.

235
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:23,560
The fact that you are here, it means you've been following our health and safety guidelines.

236
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:30,300
Not only you need to be wearing a mask, you need to be wearing KN95 equivalent mask.

237
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:36,440
And I've heard concerns from attendees yesterday who said that we weren't being strict about

238
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,440
this or we weren't enforcing it.

239
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,540
And I apologize that we have caused you such distress.

240
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,580
We are taking this seriously.

241
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,480
So this is how it's going to work.

242
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,480
Starting today, we are enforcing this.

243
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,520
The way it works is that if I or any of the staff members we see you not following the

244
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,480
guidelines, we see you not wearing masks except when it's allowed, like when you're eating

245
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:11,060
in the expo hall or if you're giving a talk, we will come and scan your badge.

246
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,680
And that will count as one strike.

247
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,280
After three strikes, we'll ask you to leave.

248
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:24,700
And we might not even, I think we're not going to bother giving you warning or notice.

249
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,700
There will be no conversation.

250
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,360
There will be no negotiation, no arguing.

251
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,920
We'll just come and scan your badge.

252
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:41,280
We at PyCon, we really deeply committed to providing safe and positive experience for

253
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,900
everyone.

254
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:49,520
In order to ensure this, all staff, attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers at any PyCon

255
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,160
events are required to adhere to the code of conduct.

256
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,660
No one is an exception.

257
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:01,660
No harassment, whether verbal, physical or discrimination will be tolerated.

258
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:08,940
Every person here will be provided with harassment free experience regardless of gender, gender

259
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:16,940
identity, expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, neuro-type, physical appearance,

260
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,680
body size, race or religion or like thereof.

261
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,120
And you can read more in the full text in our code of conduct here and there will be

262
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:34,120
linked on, it will have links to the procedures for handling incidents and enforcement policies.

263
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:41,340
If you believe someone has violated the PyCon code of conduct, you are encouraged to report

264
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,340
it regardless of the severity.

265
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:55,880
At any point you can make a report by emailing PyCon-us-report at Python.org or you can come

266
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,900
to the staff room, find any member in the staff room to file a report.

267
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:08,960
So now that you know everything about PyCon, I have a personal challenge for you.

268
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,640
The challenge is this.

269
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,640
Give yourself one point for each thing here that you have done during PyCon-us, starting

270
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,760
Wednesday and all the way until the end of the sprints.

271
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,760
And the goal here is to get as many points as you can and your reward is bragging rights,

272
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:33,660
knowing that you did something really cool at PyCon-us.

273
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:39,020
Another reward is that even if you do just one of this, you made another person really

274
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,700
happy.

275
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:48,420
So shout out to Hugo who said, I checked yesterday, he said he has done nine points so far.

276
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:55,420
For myself, I haven't checked today, but for myself I think I accidentally agreed to speak

277
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:02,480
at PyLadies Seoul in South Korea, I don't know.

278
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,520
I'm not sure how that goes.

279
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:11,520
Anyway, okay, I know you're bored now, I know you're looking forward to listening to our

280
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,920
keynote speaker and he will be on stage real soon.

281
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:22,920
Before that, again I want to say thanks to our sponsors, our visionary sponsor Meta.

282
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:28,100
Itamar from Meta is here and if you would like to share a few words with you all.
