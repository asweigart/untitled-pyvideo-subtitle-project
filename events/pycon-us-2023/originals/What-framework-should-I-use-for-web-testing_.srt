1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,860
So is the marketing ____ ____ the послед Tory to flips Nelson shirt?

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,680
Yeah, check this out, join the process as well.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:18,780
So this is the first question, because this question is all about the kind of thing,

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,460
like the dirty stuff, the dirty stuff, the defects, there are a few pikes,

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,940
so therefore I still think we shouldат theant to bring these clandestine projects

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:30,940
I'm going to get to you.

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,440
You know, I don't want to get very long,

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,940
because I don't want to get too long.

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,940
You know, it's interesting.

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,940
You know, speaking of your notes,

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,940
I was very, very interested in your

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,940
and your direction of your work.

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,940
I was very, very interested in your work.

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,940
I feel very, very concerned

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,940
that you've been so very, very

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:47,940
concerned about the work that you do.

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,940
But I think that I can do all the

18
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,940
different things that I can do

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,940
in a way that we're all concerned about.

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,940
The way I can do this,

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,940
all of it, is that I'm going to set the target.

22
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,940
I'm going to set the target here,

23
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,940
and I'm going to set the target

24
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,940
for the final question,

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,940
which has to do with what's going on.

26
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,940
And that's what's often said about

27
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,940
people who are not going to be

28
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,940
loud, clearly, if you teach

29
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,940
louds, it would seem

30
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,940
that things are going pretty

31
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,940
tough for them.

32
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,940
It's not easy.

33
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,940
So, this is my development.

34
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,940
I'm going to explain it to you

35
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,940
in a few words,

36
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,940
but I'm going to start taking it

37
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,940
from the beginning.

38
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,940
This is what I've been working on

39
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,940
for two years, two years and a half,

40
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,940
but it was before that,

41
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,940
and it's a long way from what I was doing.

42
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,940
I'm working on it,

43
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,940
but it's still not easy to see

44
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,940
how I'm going to make it

45
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,940
as fast as I can.

46
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,940
I think it's because

47
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,940
I'm still trying to get

48
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,940
the best of the best of the best

49
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,940
and being able to get

50
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,940
the best of the best things

51
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,940
and getting the best of the best

52
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,940
of the people I'm working with.

53
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,940
This is just the first step

54
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,940
that I've ever done in my career.

55
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,940
So, I've been doing it

56
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,940
in the first five years.

57
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,940
I've done it a lot of times.

58
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,940
It's a lot of work even.

59
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,940
So, a lot of things have been

60
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,940
done in the past two years,

61
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,940
but it's taking a lot more time

62
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,940
than it's taken in the last six years.

63
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,940
So, what I've been doing

64
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,940
is I've been doing it

65
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,940
in the web, in the Facebook,

66
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,940
and in the Facebook community.

67
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,940
I've been doing it in the web,

68
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,940
in the web, in the Facebook community.

69
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,940
It's been more than a year

70
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,940
since I've been doing it

71
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,940
in the first few months.

72
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,940
It's been short,

73
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,940
and it's an education

74
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,940
that I've had in the past

75
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,940
for about two years.

76
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,940
So, it's a challenge,

77
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,940
it's a challenge,

78
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,940
it's a challenge for me.

79
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,940
Actually, it's a challenge

80
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,940
for me to actually do

81
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,940
a lot of research.

82
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,940
Now, the other three things

83
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,940
that I've done

84
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,940
are the first one,

85
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,940
introducing the data

86
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,940
from the end of the first three years,

87
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,940
and actually,

88
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,940
it's a change that

89
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,940
will help me break

90
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,940
these two long years

91
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,940
of this business model.

92
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,940
The second one,

93
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,940
when we're talking

94
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,940
about the five years

95
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,940
that's produced,

96
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,940
it's a change that

97
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,940
I've been trying to do

98
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,940
for the last three years.

99
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,940
I think it's a definitely

100
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,940
a good one,

101
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,940
I think,

102
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,940
for the last three years.

103
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,940
So, after a while,

104
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,940
you see the value

105
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,940
of the community.

106
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,940
It's not called

107
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,940
the top-rated industry,

108
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,940
but the global or the bottom-rated.

109
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,940
So, the top-rated industry

110
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,940
is called

111
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,940
the number of lists.

112
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,940
Here, I've got this

113
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,940
for four years,

114
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,940
first years,

115
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,940
the project,

116
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,940
which was called

117
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,940
the library of ideas

118
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,940
in the second year.

119
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,940
So, if the source was

120
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,940
the rest of the research

121
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,940
from the first years,

122
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,940
the source was

123
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,940
the data.

124
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,940
I think that's

125
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,940
a visual

126
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,940
and a biological strength

127
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,940
of anything

128
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,940
that you can jump

129
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,940
into the database.

130
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,940
I can also

131
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,940
add a little bit

132
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,940
of the three-month

133
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,940
basis list,

134
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,940
which is a couple

135
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,940
of years

136
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,940
before the first

137
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,940
year was published.

138
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,940
It's called

139
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,940
the second-year

140
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,940
project.

141
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,940
So, now I'm going to

142
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,940
talk about the five years

143
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,940
that have been produced.

144
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,940
Before, it was a nice

145
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,940
little project

146
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,940
to do in the audience.

147
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,940
Of course, that's

148
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,940
a reading of

149
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,940
this one,

150
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,940
a low-level

151
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,940
project,

152
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,940
but it's a

153
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,940
little bit more

154
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,940
complex,

155
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,940
which is probably

156
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,940
going to be

157
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,940
more interesting

158
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,940
for you.

159
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,940
So, I'll go

160
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,940
through the studies.

161
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,940
How many people

162
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,940
do you actually

163
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,940
agree to

164
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,940
set up

165
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,940
to build this?

166
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,940
Okay, I don't have

167
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,940
any free questions

168
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,940
if there are

169
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,940
no others.

170
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,940
I'm so

171
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,940
confident

172
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,940
that people

173
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,940
are going to

174
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,940
be able to

175
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,940
do this.

176
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,940
So, what we do

177
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,940
is that

178
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,940
I've found that

179
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,940
we haven't actually

180
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,940
done

181
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,940
a lot of

182
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,940
research on

183
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,940
this project.

184
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,940
It's pretty cool.

185
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,940
It uses

186
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,940
a lot of

187
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,940
technical

188
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,940
knowledge

189
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,940
for the

190
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,940
development

191
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,940
process.

192
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,940
It uses

193
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,940
best-of-the-rack

194
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,940
because

195
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,940
following the

196
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,940
engineering

197
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,940
process

198
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,940
is a

199
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,940
little bit

200
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,940
of a

201
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,940
challenge.

202
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,940
But, it's

203
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,940
just a little bit

204
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,940
of a

205
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,940
little bit

206
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,940
of a

207
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,940
bit of a

208
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,940
challenge.

209
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,940
I'm not

210
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,940
sure that

211
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,940
I'm going

212
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,940
to

213
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,940
do

214
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,940
this

215
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,940
in the

216
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,940
end of

217
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,940
the

218
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,940
paper.

219
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,940
I'm

220
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,940
going to

221
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,940
do this

222
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,940
in the

223
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,940
next

224
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,940
few

225
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,940
weeks

226
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,940
and

227
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,940
I'm

228
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,940
going to

229
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,940
do this

230
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,940
in the

231
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,940
next

232
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,940
few

233
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,940
weeks.

234
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,940
I'm going to

235
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,940
do this

236
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,940
in the

237
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,940
next

238
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,740
the opportunity for the first best-dressed women to wear.

239
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,420
So getting back to the big topic here,

240
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,660
we have this awesome piece of stuff here.

241
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,700
In all of these pieces, we have a lot of testing for this.

242
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,220
You know, this is a small lecture,

243
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,980
but all the boxes are all in papers,

244
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,780
and I'm going to talk about this stuff in a bit.

245
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,180
Yes, and I'm going to read that in a bit,

246
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,780
because I'm going to take a look at some of the questions

247
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,860
that were brought up in the previous lecture.

248
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,980
I'd like to catch up on what you were saying.

249
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,660
So we've got the family test, and this is an app.

250
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,420
This thing about basically fixing the problem,

251
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,140
and you can take a good look at the other test,

252
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,780
but what it says is that it's legally valid,

253
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,700
so it's not a serious one.

254
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,620
And it says, unfortunately,

255
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,140
not your reaction is not so good.

256
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,340
Every time we add a new figure,

257
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,500
we increase the creativity of the women.

258
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,740
And we were telling the women

259
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,780
that they're just going to be better than they are at the moment.

260
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,340
So what I would like is for women to be well-developed,

261
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,340
but well-not-competitive,

262
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,100
which is exactly what this study is saying.

263
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,820
If we get to the point where preference is less important

264
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,300
and we don't follow the app,

265
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,620
then it's beautiful, and that's going to make it

266
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,980
much more fun and more fun to look at.

267
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,380
And if it's a false thought,

268
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,580
well, you can tell the truth, and you can conclude

269
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,260
that it's a good point to look at.

270
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,220
Okay, so we're going to do the test now.

271
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,500
But is it testing it?

272
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,860
It really is testing it.

273
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,260
I was just thinking if you're going to talk about

274
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,180
testing things, make sure you're creating a good revenue.

275
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,900
So, yes, we will continue to generate the right prices.

276
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,780
I want to talk about the fact that the prices are great,

277
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,100
and that's true if you want to make the industry stand out.

278
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,260
The problem is that we can afford to just buy prices

279
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,380
for the rest of the world, for instance.

280
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,940
In the context, it is essential that we just play the same thing.

281
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,100
It won't start with a drop in the cost function

282
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,220
if we just put in the cost of the head.

283
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,140
But we're going to be waiting for the total back

284
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,700
with the balance in some of the problems.

285
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,020
And we don't just do the same thing.

286
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,700
It's the fact that we can do the same thing

287
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,980
to structure our tests and make them as good as we can.

288
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,620
All right, so the biggest thing to focus on

289
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,300
is testing the revenue.

290
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,660
So this is a cost-efficient article

291
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,940
that goes into the test for end-of-life.

292
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,860
I'm going to leave you with a few good things to focus on.

293
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,660
So we do this.

294
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,540
The cost-efficient article does have a lot of focus

295
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,220
on the cost-efficient of the end-of-life.

296
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,900
And the main benefit of the article

297
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,500
in this article is that it's dynamic,

298
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,900
regular news rejected fromICE.

299
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,380
We've just put that from where it was files

300
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,460
So the article is defined

301
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,540
in the western newscasts,

302
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,860
only on the train,

303
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,280
but new news reports,

304
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,260
all about the stock.

305
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,580
The azure news...

306
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,620
listen to the news like there are no news with highlights.

307
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,980
We don't just respond to everyday face-iS miedo statements.

308
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,800
Does this explain the question like a

309
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,780
배 드� quasbir majority?

310
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:43,780
So, there is not a whole lot of things that are in existence.

311
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,780
It's just a few things that exist.

312
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,780
Okay, so what's that?

313
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,780
There's actually a few things that exist.

314
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,780
There's the data transfer.

315
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,780
It's just a bit of a breakdown of some of the things that are in existence.

316
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,780
It's really cool to be able to do it and to contrast it, which is really what we need to do in order to actually do it.

317
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,780
Okay, so we've got the data transfer.

318
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,780
What about like, even with the data transfer?

319
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,780
Well, it's not far. It's not so far away.

320
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,780
But that's just the truth.

321
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,780
What are these orders in this data transfer?

322
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,780
Oh, these jobs. That's a lot of people who use the word jobs.

323
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,780
It's not a big deal. Well, but y'all gotta provide jobs for people who use the word jobs.

324
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,780
It's not just for money.

325
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,780
It's for the collection.

326
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,780
It's a collection. It's still the one that's left of the bottom of the mission list.

327
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,780
It's a reason. It's a service group. It's a question.

328
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,780
And we don't have to go through thousands of different missions.

329
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,780
The way it's run is works is that you can get your own surprise and surprise from a company that works over a company.

330
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,780
Which is also an experience that we've been getting since we've all been given orders in the data transfer.

331
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,780
So it's one of the projects that's folded into two.

332
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,780
So the logic of this project is that if you want to find and then you don't have to use the code,

333
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,780
you should open up these boxes and you can get your own surprise.

334
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:03,780
So what you are trying to do is you can get your surprise and you can get your surprise and you can get your surprise.

335
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,780
And there is no one company that you can get your surprise from.

336
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,780
So these websites are also a lot more fun to find.

337
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,780
You can find them in the Microsofts. You can find them in the JavaScript, Excel, and even in the Mac.

338
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,780
So that's the way it works.

339
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:30,780
So the logic of this web developer is that you are trying to grab the real-time surprise from a company or a company that's been given orders for thousands of different missions.

340
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,780
And that's for example, if you don't have to use the money that goes out of your pocket, you can grab the news from a company.

341
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,780
But it's also a good idea to do it on a business level.

342
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:45,780
So, when the web developer gets a surprise, it will watch the web developer to give you a surprise and it will say,

343
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,780
it's a good idea to use it through the web developer protocol.

344
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:54,780
This is not an actual web developer code. It's really just a simple, simple, easy-to-use concept.

345
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,780
I would never use this for the web developer experience. I would recommend doing that through a practice question.

346
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:04,780
If you find a company that has a project that is one of the most interesting and you are using it in your project,

347
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,780
all you do is add them an item and it's just a fantastic one.

348
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,780
This way, you can use it in a place where you are not the only person that has a project that you are using.

349
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,780
And it might also be something that's going to be a little bit more interesting, but it's probably the best thing.

350
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,780
You also might want to set an example for the web developer.

351
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,780
This is a situation where the web developer has a project that we want to set up and this is this.

352
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:30,780
So you want to set up a project that is going to be a little bit more interesting, but it's a little bit more explicitly good.

353
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:36,780
And there's definitely other proposals that you might be able to set up out of context at the open.

354
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:55,140
If you have seen a product through any of theors, you know there are people that sort out stuff for you using it in

355
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,780
their team meetings that we don't recommend.

356
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,780
So it just allows you to design how to do good work.

357
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,620
and I like to talk a little bit about tech in some tech.

358
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,340
So you also want to run a test on

359
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,540
who you need to let them do the work in the conference.

360
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,140
So we start with this test today.

361
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,420
We have first step is,

362
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,100
get in the lobby and go to this room,

363
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,820
that's one of the rooms.

364
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,500
Here we can call out around 20 minutes,

365
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,900
that's the time we need to start

366
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,740
with the lecture on the next day.

367
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,420
We can call you around the lobby,

368
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,060
or it's all in English.

369
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,180
But things work a little bit in Spanish.

370
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,220
So they can specifically find the room.

371
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,820
So we're going to use our walls and we're going to

372
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,420
grab a few desks,

373
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,620
and we're going to speak in English,

374
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,540
and we're going to speak in English,

375
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,620
and we're going to put our hands in front of you.

376
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,140
This actually requires three units,

377
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,860
and the type of unit,

378
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,060
and the type of test that you need to put the lobby on.

379
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,340
So, for example, this was first called

380
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,220
round the clock,

381
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,500
round the clock,

382
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,540
the room will be here,

383
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,260
and you're going to put up the test.

384
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,900
But when you do use the test,

385
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,060
you're going to use the assessment unit,

386
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,740
and it's going to be put in,

387
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,700
and you're going to put up the test.

388
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,660
And then you'll locate the login button,

389
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,500
and you'll do this,

390
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,860
and you'll search the folder,

391
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,100
and you'll press on the button,

392
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,860
which actually will go to the lobby.

393
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,300
And once the lobby is in place,

394
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,660
then it's asking for the adoption of the lobby,

395
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,820
so that it leaves the room

396
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,140
and you can do some of the testing for the lobby.

397
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,300
So that's what we'll do today,

398
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,140
and I'll say,

399
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,700
it's called, how will we say it?

400
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,020
Going into the page object,

401
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,300
so it's in English,

402
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,940
and then it's going to go to the results,

403
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,740
and we'll put up the test.

404
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,020
But I just wanted to show you

405
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,740
what else the lobby includes here,

406
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,900
so you can see.

407
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,100
That's the fact that it's a button

408
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,620
that you can buy at the end of the test history,

409
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,820
and it's large,

410
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,660
but not the whole thing.

411
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,500
So you can see,

412
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,180
wait for the right issues to come up

413
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,980
before they're accepted into the test.

414
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,060
And then,

415
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,620
this is what the test operator can do,

416
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,500
yes, they're both thinking about the whole thing.

417
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,580
So that's the process of what comes,

418
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,020
when they can't find the right ones.

419
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,620
New proper ways to do this,

420
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,460
a lot of this,

421
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,300
what we're doing is,

422
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,820
it's a process.

423
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,860
I'm going to go into a bit of a technical term,

424
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,300
but I'll just give you a few examples.

425
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,060
That is the process of having to manage the specific weight.

426
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,900
But also,

427
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,180
we're also doing

428
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,620
implicit and explicit weight complex,

429
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,100
as flying over the fixed-referred,

430
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,940
we saw before,

431
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,260
that we're making a specific weight complex

432
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,380
that's specific,

433
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,540
because we brought a lot of weight

434
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,380
to the group of units,

435
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,220
so,

436
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,140
we're not going to do a lot of weight complex,

437
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,980
but,

438
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,820
the first thing that we're going to do is,

439
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,260
we're going to do the test project,

440
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,060
and we're going to do a small test,

441
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,620
where we're going to be able to do a specific weight,

442
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,620
so that we can get a specific weight,

443
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,620
and then we're going to do a specific weight complex.

444
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,340
So what we're going to do is,

445
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,180
we're going to do a specific weight complex,

446
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,020
which works well,

447
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,980
and it's part of the process of doing a specific weight complex.

448
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,820
But,

449
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,640
first of all,

450
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,480
like we just said,

451
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,300
it's the one that we find by our vehicles,

452
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,140
when we're performing.

453
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,580
When we first talk to the group,

454
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,620
we're going to do test project,

455
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,980
which is where we're going to be able to do a specific weight complex.

456
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,820
So,

457
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,540
it is strongly recommended that you use a plug-in,

458
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,860
and talk to the group,

459
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,540
like a Friday dinner,

460
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,380
or a separate meeting,

461
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,460
or an H3 plug-in for your business.

462
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,280
So,

463
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,120
we're going to do a specific weight complex,

464
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,980
where we're going to be able to do a specific weight complex.

465
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,260
Let me say that again.

466
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,100
So,

467
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,060
now you're talking about a different weight complex.

468
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,060
We need to do a small,

469
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,900
that means,

470
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,020
that we're going to be able to execute a weight complex,

471
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,020
to the system,

472
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,980
for every platform we have.

473
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,820
And then,

474
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,660
it's a place where the different weight complexes are created.

475
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,940
It's very common in this world,

476
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,620
that we must talk scale-wise,

477
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,140
and then we're grabbing our automatic relative,

478
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,140
and it's worked,

479
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,540
and then we're going to go back to the load-drawer,

480
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,180
and it's created.

481
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,020
So,

482
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,980
I think we've successfully developed that piece of it.

483
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,060
Let's just really go over,

484
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,900
how many projects,

485
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,220
how many projects need to be done,

486
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,380
and how many of them,

487
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,500
how many of them are actually,

488
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,540
and how many of those things can be done,

489
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,820
and those things.

490
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,660
So,

491
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,480
the first thing you're talking about,

492
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,320
is the load-drawer.

493
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,540
This next load-drawer is best for the,

494
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,780
for the case of the shoulders.

495
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,900
So, for performance,

496
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,540
it might be roughly 50,000,

497
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,580
that's mostly those cases.

498
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,400
But,

499
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,240
it's 40,000,

500
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,660
so that's a really nice number.

501
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,620
And it also applies to the shoulders.

502
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,460
So,

503
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,420
we have a load-drawer solution.

504
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,460
And that is quite useful,

505
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,060
and we want to be able to do it.

506
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,900
And the one example,

507
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,260
is the event.

508
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,620
It's a really long event,

509
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,460
even though it's not that long,

510
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,300
it's a really long,

511
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,660
it's a really long time period.

512
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,780
So, what is that?

513
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,260
So, you have a load-drawer.

514
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,700
Sweatwitch is a long,

515
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,540
long,

516
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,380
long-term stress swing,

517
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,780
which the web-drawer is called.

518
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,100
And it's called the Drawing Test Swing,

519
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,020
or the Move-In-Wave.

520
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,840
The set-up,

521
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,780
you can write down the protocol,

522
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,980
and that's what we did with the,

523
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,060
the graduate prediction,

524
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,460
and all the generalist reports.

525
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,280
It's that,

526
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,500
where you can actually operate

527
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,340
through the same,

528
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,100
the graduate process.

529
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,380
Sweatwitch is an open source project,

530
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,200
and the company,

531
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,040
is not good,

532
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,880
once again,

533
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,720
sometimes.

534
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,540
So,

535
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,260
three,

536
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,460
three years.

537
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,380
It's sort of an open source project.

538
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,460
So, the things

539
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,300
that are out of this,

540
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,180
it's cool but takes quite a lot

541
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,140
of space in a place that's on

542
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,700
a whole whole bunch of different

543
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,540
populations,

544
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,460
because ultimately it's a very

545
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:11,800
similar

546
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,100
kind of complex

547
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,020
things that we've heard,

548
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,940
like I'm about to say,

549
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,120
maybe more from

550
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,780
the US perspective,

551
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,620
so you can look,

552
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,620
the API testing to come up with a new IP address for you.

553
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,620
And you know what I'm saying.

554
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:27,620
However, unfortunately, the use of this model is that this test must be made exclusively

555
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,620
in Java Spanx.

556
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,620
Or, in other words, in the library.

557
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:39,620
So, here's the code for the book.ly access to the IP address.

558
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,620
These steps are pretty much the same as the code.

559
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,620
So, there's a pretty simple browser function.

560
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,620
Cross-bite with college grade right-click view.

561
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,620
It's a very wide view.

562
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,620
So, it's also very easy to size the freedom of thinking.

563
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,620
This is the only Java Spanx you can possibly bring in and don't need to run this code.

564
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,620
We can execute it in a few moments, so we can get the best of this model.

565
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,620
And it's pretty much the same as the IP address.

566
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,620
But we didn't have to use it because it is completely open.

567
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,620
All it's lost now is the secret of this code.

568
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:15,620
Now, look how easy it is to already manage this razor-sharp Napoleon code,

569
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,620
which makes the code less powerful in sometimes.

570
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:26,620
You can bridge the gap like a security photovoltaic between one sp começar case.

571
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:33,620
How will we do that?

572
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,620
Spr emerges over the Hop Guardian in Einzel, Da P續 Lake, Europe.

573
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,620
That reveals the conduct of the cursive disk.

574
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,620
All that's left is the last one. It is jobless programming.

575
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,620
It's a very long, complex list of questions, of language and writing.

576
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,620
Do you really think that's the only way to work with this?

577
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,620
That's the best way to work with this.

578
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:58,620
Which, just so you can understand, is that if you type that, it would be a very difficult task to do.

579
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:04,620
But if you're already trying to find the correct example of that, what happens is that you do.

580
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:11,620
So if you're already in a good, complex list of questions, you can easily split them apart.

581
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,620
Secondly, it also takes a lot of time to take things into account.

582
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,620
Most of it is done in the end, in the beginning.

583
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,620
But I think the cycles in the end, it may well be one or two times more time.

584
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,620
So I'm telling you, it's not strictly the same.

585
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,620
But I think it's a lot of time to take things into account.

586
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,620
I think you've got to start with something that's really complex.

587
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,620
It's also a very important exercise.

588
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,620
It's one of the most important things.

589
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,620
It's not the kind of work that you want from one person to another.

590
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,620
You pull in a lot of money, a lot of play around with it, and you put in a lot of work.

591
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,620
Not just for the sake of it, but for the sake of the others.

592
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:52,620
The play around is not just about these two, but the things that are important for the sort of stress-free life.

593
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,620
It's the very important thing for your life.

594
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,620
And it's not just about the things that you want to do.

595
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,620
In the end, I think the most important thing is to look at those three points.

596
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,620
That's the one I'm trying to go over today, but I'm not sure I'll jump start.

597
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,620
And this piece is about how to get a big, fastest, concrete community to start a business.

598
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,620
If you were going to switch my profile into the right-hand side of the program,

599
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,620
what are the things that you want from the program?

600
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,620
So like my last presentation, I'm going to go into a bunch of things.

601
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,620
Instead of addressing the whole bathroom floor, which is the first one,

602
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,620
there's a small body, and then there's the party.

603
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,620
It's as if the house party is the one that's important for me.

604
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,620
Not just in work and work-day.

605
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,620
Like some places, it's quite rare that I ask the questions I need.

606
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,620
And like some others, clearing out the space, I think some of us will probably find the answers.

607
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,620
But we don't know.

608
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:50,620
The setup, the play around, the course, we would introduce in the start-up, and the start-up.

609
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,620
We would also introduce some of these classes, like the rest of the party,

610
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,620
which provides a bunch of information that we can just introduce to the client-side.

611
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:04,620
So it's a bunch of things that we can invent online.

612
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,620
And a group of other things, we will also introduce crowd-sizing services.

613
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,620
And we can create right-handers, which is a lot of support,

614
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,620
all the entities that we want to be working with.

615
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,620
Next, we'll get really far to do a bit of a mention for this,

616
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,620
is the page, the word, and the page that we're going to use.

617
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,620
And then for instance, we're going to introduce the course to find the setup.

618
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,620
Instead of watching the new graduate list, we're going to test

619
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,620
what things we need for the next program.

620
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,620
This is more of a practice instance, more of a solid practice instance.

621
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:45,620
This is a test instance, where you can find the concepts for the current instance,

622
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,620
which is what we've been trying to do especially with the new practice instance.

623
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,620
And it's very simple to do strictly with these two things.

624
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,620
It works faster than a typical practice instance.

625
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:59,620
So up here, for instance, is putting in the practice instance that the context

626
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,620
is a message from the beginning of the practice instance.

627
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,620
So the context is context of the same service, and the importance of the training,

628
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,620
of this work, of any kind that you're doing.

629
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,620
So I'll take the muscle of that input, which is what works with the content of this life.

630
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,620
So we don't have to use three of them to do the whole thing.

631
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,620
So the context must be in the same way that our language and cases.

632
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,620
And if you really want to test the parallelism in the master instance,

633
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,620
you have to use the practice instance in this case.

634
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,620
So we get the ability to call the test before time, but this time it's the right way to do it.

635
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,620
That's the pattern.

636
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,620
The pattern is pretty similar to what we saw before.

637
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,620
The use of the tools to do the strategy of the master instance is not the right step

638
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:46,620
to do the strategy of the master instance, but rather how they work in the process.

639
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,620
When we write all interactions happening within the native language,

640
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,620
we can then take the intuitive test function, the error, the notice,

641
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,620
which helps us to know how to protect the context of the instance.

642
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,620
So we look at this busily, and we look at this clearly,

643
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,620
to the practice of the context of the instance,

644
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,620
pretty much the same thing as the master instance.

645
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,620
So tonight we acknowledge that we have done this in the last round,

646
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,620
and what round we've done is that we've done a lot of tests in this case.

647
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,620
So we're going to create an interactive context for this session on that instance.

648
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,620
And that will create a block of code within that context for the instance case.

649
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,620
When we read this code, we see both leaders providing automation

650
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,620
to those products in the block and the other elements.

651
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,620
So we can then take the output of those vectors, carry it out that way,

652
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,620
and it's weighted, and I think we can use the force of the force to do this in the case.

653
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,620
When we write the master instance, the instance is such a long series,

654
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,620
where we do those things from the master instance to the reading instance,

655
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,620
so we can take the business case as proof.

656
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:56,620
And as we read this code, we can see that we're really taking a look at how to make these kinds of things.

657
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,620
And that's something that I thought was probably very, very common in some of the top tools,

658
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,620
but you've got the host code and the fire-runner, so you can do things like that.

659
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,620
And we're really taking a look at the force of the data to expect these things as high-level

660
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,620
as we can in the beginning.

661
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,620
And then we've got our very basic blocks, which are the data that we've already watched before.

662
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,620
And the fact that that is a very much like that in the beginning.

663
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,620
And now for the last one, which is one of the most important things in this course,

664
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,620
is that we've already watched it.

665
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,620
We've probably watched it in the beginning, in the jar jar,

666
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,620
when we were just looking at the code, in the basic visualizations,

667
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,620
rather than in the actual code.

668
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,620
And I just wanted to say, thanks for the time you've been with us.

669
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:47,620
So, I think we've had a lot more course-wise than we've had time to get into today.

670
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,620
And it's not just about the reading, the algorithm, the mechanics.

671
00:23:51,620 --> 00:24:17,520
So, the test result will not be verymental for the data

672
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,280
and you want something that just leaves,

673
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,280
remember what is the one life that's right for you,

674
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,640
to do something wrong with you.

675
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,360
However, with all this proof that you don't think

676
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,880
that anything's right for you,

677
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,880
and it also has the right to do it,

678
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,800
please, clearly test all your enemies,

679
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,000
not for the sake of your self.

680
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,960
For example, if you're a person

681
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,200
and you see a lot of people that don't think

682
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,880
that they're doing the right thing,

683
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,400
it might be more disgustingly to think

684
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,120
that someone else thinks that,

685
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,760
rather than you graduate,

686
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,960
because that's fine, you can't do it.

687
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,440
So, if you're a great historian,

688
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,120
and you've used our evidence for many years,

689
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,680
but you're not sure if it's true

690
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,600
that you're a good scholar,

691
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,200
you probably won't find this nice,

692
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,320
accurate, or general evidence

693
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,680
that others think you're a scholar,

694
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,320
and if you truly have asked for the evidence of all of it,

695
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,640
so you've braved your self-content.

696
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,120
So, now that we've worked the follow-up

697
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,800
to let you inspect this,

698
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,560
and play along,

699
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,000
we're able to study everything that we've done

700
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
with our questions.

701
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,280
We're just watching you,

702
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,880
and we're just waiting for you to answer them.

703
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
So, we're just waiting for you to answer them.

704
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,960
We're just waiting for you to answer them.

705
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,000
After the three questions,

706
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,880
we'll present you with the key

707
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,480
to your work with claims to let you

708
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,680
for the sake of your reasons.

709
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,120
What about you?

710
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,120
One, somebody's not sure what's right for you,

711
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,800
so for me, for virtually any of the questions

712
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
that we've had so far,

713
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,400
it's probably wrong to just look at it

714
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,640
and answer them,

715
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,720
because it's a very difficult question to answer.

716
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,800
One person, Rachel, mentioned this to me.

717
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,680
Rachel, if you have any questions,

718
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,360
okay, I'll take them.

719
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,000
And then, Mr. Martin, you're the one who said,

720
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,720
I'm going to ask a question.

721
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,120
There's a lot of questions,

722
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,560
and you were going to ask one question.

723
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,120
What?

724
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,080
The question is,

725
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,520
Rachel, since when did you look at it?

726
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,080
Well, the best way to pick up those questions

727
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,280
is not about them,

728
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,760
it's about what the devil does.

729
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,920
It really depends on the audience.

730
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,040
I've been looking for an algorithm

731
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,120
that gives that face to me.

732
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,760
I want to put the landing page

733
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,360
on the front page of the table before front desk.

734
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,760
If you want to take it to the simplest slide,

735
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,200
it's the front desk.

736
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,280
It's the middle table.

737
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,240
So that's the problem.

738
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,960
So what I'm going to do,

739
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,520
I'm going to use the back of the page

740
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,720
to look for the most important

741
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,360
thing that's in the institutions.

742
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,000
It's important for all the participants

743
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,840
to have a look at the database.

744
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,800
They have all the information

745
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,320
that's in it, in the database.

746
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,000
However, it is a global browser

747
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,360
and it is not a free-trade.

748
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,120
So my question is,

749
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,080
what all of that framework

750
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,680
that's on the front page of the database?

751
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Is it essentially a web that tests the web?

752
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,840
And it has to be tested

753
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,720
to do the same problem that

754
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,960
the process is in the database.

755
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,320
It supports the best browsers,

756
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,000
but must be committed exclusively

757
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,760
in the JavaScript.

758
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,880
I think the best way to do that

759
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,880
is to use variables in this problem.

760
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,720
And I think it's popularly,

761
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,760
very quickly, for people to think

762
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,720
that they need a platform of resources.

763
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,760
It's not just all the data

764
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,200
that's in the disk libraries,

765
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
but the multiple data

766
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,920
that's in the disk library.

767
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,480
So I'm just going to use this word,

768
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,600
I'm going to use this word,

769
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,840
because it was the last time

770
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,960
that this problem was not

771
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,920
works in separate ways

772
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,280
to configure the issues

773
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,240
for that problem to be solved.

774
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,400
And for all of the things that we've done,

775
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,480
I'm going to use this word,

776
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,760
the block list,

777
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,840
the post-problems.

778
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,560
I, the file register,

779
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,280
that actually works for me.

780
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,600
And I'm now doing it,

781
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,040
I'm now defining the response of this.

782
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,480
I'm going to use this code.

783
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,840
It's valid.

784
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,120
It's a theory.

785
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,760
It's a very good word.

786
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,720
And it's in-line.

787
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,880
It's public.

788
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,520
It's real-time.

789
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,480
It's highly-regulated.

790
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,760
It's very, very simple.

791
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,800
But it's a good test for the future.

792
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,600
And I love it.

793
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,640
When I first used it,

794
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,200
I loved it.

795
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,240
It used to work with the file

796
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,880
testers,

797
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,240
and it was a good way to do it.

798
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,400
And I think the clearer is that

799
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,800
the more the fluid is released,

800
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,880
the closer the things are to the end.

801
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,600
The closer the data is released.

802
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,760
That's what I think.

803
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,040
That's why I would try to

804
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,560
make it interesting

805
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,200
to try to learn the facades

806
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
of where the history

807
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,520
of the data is from.

808
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,960
I think that's what I'm trying to do.

809
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,800
So I'm going to try to do something else.

810
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,040
Now, this is not something

811
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,200
that I do quite often.

812
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
I'm trying to think of a question

813
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,280
about the risks.

814
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,080
I'm trying to think of

815
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,320
the things that I'm trying to do

816
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,920
in general.

817
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,400
So this is very much the bottom

818
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,000
of the line.

819
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,480
I love it.

820
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,560
It's really interesting.

821
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,880
And so,

822
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,640
good things come in

823
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,320
when you use those.

824
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,400
And I'm going to go over more

825
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,640
about the basics of it.

826
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,480
And I'm going to talk about

827
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
the features and the features

828
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,200
that I think are the most

829
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
important in this.

830
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,640
So I'm going to speak

831
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,080
a little bit about

832
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,640
the things that I think

833
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,120
are the most important in this.

834
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,080
And the data line

835
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,720
possibly has four steps

836
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
in terms of what

837
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,840
the flow of things is.

838
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,240
So the first step is

839
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,000
to have a very specific history.

840
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,840
And we can also find

841
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,840
a specific history.

842
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,600
So now that we know

843
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,800
the access to data,

844
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,600
we can see the evidence

845
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
for a number of things.

846
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,520
So there's 100 steps.

847
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,280
I know we have a few

848
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:14,960
problems with the network

849
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,720
but I'm glad

850
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,680
we've done this before.

851
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,760
So that was it.

852
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,560
So that's my basic

853
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,920
interest of this university.

854
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,400
You guys know the discovery.

855
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,040
Both of them have been

856
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,360
very useful and very important.

857
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,720
But here, if you raise a box,

858
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
you have to accept that

859
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,120
if you're going to get

860
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,880
to the issues of

861
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,840
what's not possible

862
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,200
in our environment.

863
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,000
And what are the challenges

864
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,800
and questions

865
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,360
about testing the evidence?

866
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,160
What kinds of

867
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,800
important things

868
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,880
are you going to face?

869
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,800
All the questions about

870
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,280
how do you create

871
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,200
a safe space.

872
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,640
All these questions about

873
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,400
the three things that you've

874
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,360
been working on.

875
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,080
All three systems.

876
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,680
The answer to that

877
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,320
question about

878
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,160
how to access this

879
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,240
is that's all about

880
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,080
how to create

881
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,360
a safe space.

882
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,880
And if you've got access to that,

883
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,760
that's really important.

884
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,080
That's the key one.

885
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,760
And if you've got the

886
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,680
question you get to answer.

887
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,600
Next, this is a very

888
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
physical assessment

889
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,240
technique that we use

890
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,440
mostly.

891
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,280
All the work that you do

892
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,680
is actually done in a lot of

893
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,440
different ways.

894
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,080
You don't have to do

895
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,600
a lot of these

896
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,440
things in your office.

897
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,520
You can just come out of it

898
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,160
and do a lot of these things.

899
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,840
And then you have to

900
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,880
find the best way to do this.

901
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,600
So, at least,

902
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,280
it's best to just

903
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,120
look at your

904
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,880
text and all the other

905
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,640
things that you can

906
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,160
do in your office.

907
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,840
If you're testing

908
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,240
kind of a

909
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,600
very important

910
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,080
category for what's called

911
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,880
the best outcome

912
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,200
in the end

913
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,560
between these

914
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,760
best practices.

915
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,720
You're actually trying

916
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,320
to look at

917
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,440
stuff that's not good.

918
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,080
So, I'll show you two

919
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,760
examples.

920
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,480
First, I want to

921
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,640
give you a summary.

922
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,320
If you want to

923
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,000
create a fast

924
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,600
digital identity

925
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,640
in your office,

926
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,120
I'm going to

927
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,640
go to this case

928
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,160
for a while because

929
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,840
this is for the top

930
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,520
and this is for the

931
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,200
bottom.

932
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,440
Let's talk.

933
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:39,920
I got some

934
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,720
cool stuff on these

935
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,480
stickers.

936
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,920
I'm going to

937
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,360
talk about

938
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:42,840
a job that

939
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,120
is worth a

940
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,400
lot of money.

941
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,000
With myself,

942
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,440
I'm taking

943
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,000
the three

944
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,440
to the right.

945
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:46,880
You want any

946
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,440
one of these

947
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:47,920
to make a

948
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,240
good

949
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,720
product that

950
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,040
works for the

951
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,320
station.

952
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,520
What's up?

953
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,920
So, if you want to

954
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,440
number one,

955
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:54,920
you're taking

956
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,240
a top

957
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,720
video

958
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,160
and you want to

959
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,520
come up

960
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:56,920
with some

961
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,800
of these things.

962
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,120
I'm going to

963
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,520
go through

964
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:58,960
the categories

965
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,640
to show you

966
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,160
which ones are

967
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,520
actually

968
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,480
the best.

969
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,000
And my name is

970
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,760
David.

971
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,280
My name is

972
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,880
Daniel.

973
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,080
I'm a

974
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,280

975
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,640
developer

976
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:04,680

977
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,160

978
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,280
for

979
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,120
companies.

980
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,360
I'm a

981
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:06,840

983
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,280

985
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,400
the University.

986
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:08,560
I've

987
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:08,680
been

988
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,840
a

989
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,200
dog

990
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,360
in

991
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,400
the

992
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:09,880
past

993
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:09,960
for

994
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,080
the

995
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,360
last

996
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:10,440
few

997
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:10,920
years.

998
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,080
So,

999
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,240
if you

1000
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,520
want to

1001
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,000

1002
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,120
you

1003
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,320
can

1004
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:12,520
try

1005
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:12,680

1006
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:12,800

1009
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,840
service.

1010
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,080
And you

1011
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,280
want to

1012
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:14,560
raise

1013
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:14,760

1014
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,080

1015
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,280

1016
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,360
the

1017
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:15,680

1018
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:15,760

company.

1024
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,280
So,

1025
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,400

00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:17,680

00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,520
I'm

1031
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:18,640
