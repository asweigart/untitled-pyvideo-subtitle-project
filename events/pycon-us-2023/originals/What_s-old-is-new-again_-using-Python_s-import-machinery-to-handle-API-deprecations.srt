1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
if you've been following and have quitting.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,200
It's great, and you could put a fix for yourself,

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,280
and I think that, yeah, it would be great

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,960
for one of us, throw a song together.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,720
I think they did it, and they felt really sometimes

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,360
when they did it, that's a great teachers I have seen,

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,840
because they're trenches and...

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:49,980
The

9
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,980
we are determined to capture the data on channel by educational channel.

10
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,980
How we do that

11
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,980
we are emulating it to our animation.

12
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:08,120
we are using special dive filters on the purpose of the

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:17,040
Stabilize demonstration politics,

14
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:29,360
And they give you an retail

15
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,280
After hearing Seem to perform testing on so many children and children

16
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,800
to control and understand each other,

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,920
I come to remind you of a situation that council grip

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,400
and I am extremely connected with

19
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,320
and this is discouraging in my own support

20
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,560
that our government was forced to acknowledge

21
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,160
rather than a physician bit and in the manner of any Fed

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,960
Even though receivers of research

23
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,820
And the discussion that has been having

24
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,260
and the emotions from the lower level

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,140
that are passing forward

26
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,840
is that it's the time for the Trading

27
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,720
that is encouraging the development of the trade

28
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,800
and introducing it now.

29
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,820
And I think

30
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,560
the tribe needs to attract aimless

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,920
and Remake

32
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,380
so that Endeavor can't be just cutting

33
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,480
Quite often, it is the case that in global, everything is destroyed.

34
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:40,300
In cherry trees, smarter workers might return to the factory and

35
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:47,600
hardly last, Тo residents are as poor as they get.

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,980
And that seems difficult.

37
00:02:49,980 --> 00:03:17,260
This is one ofYNchestral, an associative

38
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,980
and I also feel that some of the things that we are doing

39
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,980
are being done in a more positive way.

40
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,980
So, in this specific aspect,

41
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,980
I think that there is a very important aspect

42
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,980
that is very important for us to be able to

43
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,980
have the right to speak

44
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,980
and to have the right to speak

45
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,980
and to have the right to speak in a diverse way.

46
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,980
And I think that it's a very important aspect

47
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,980
that we need to be able to speak about

48
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,980
and I think that it's a very important aspect

49
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,580
which brings together the Kingdom of przyp.

50
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:57,980
This is the third point in the history of �weiswak economy

51
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,980
through which we've demonstrated,

52
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,980
already significant economic economy since the very beginning.

53
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,980
Also, there is a lot of support here

54
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,980
from the royal household efficiency

55
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,980
sector as well from ICTs to encores

56
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,040
such as

57
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,380
We have to fend for themselves, that when we cut ourselves out, we can be spread here.

58
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:37,840
Because if we are left out with a

59
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:45,440
hard cut,

60
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:45,840
then祇 have the rush to reputation.

61
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:59,380
by increasing the age group's anonymity around the word

62
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:28,260
For example, if you sent a message to the matching panel on Read On

63
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,900
And again, I thought he was writing for the mission,

64
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,800
as he did for the military...

65
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,260
...and right in time, he was there.

66
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:47,700
It is interesting that about the acting of

67
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,020
theding police officers and other people

68
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,780
of the military,

69
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,240
as early as the beginning of

70
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,180
the former ensuite life,

71
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,900
And so far, the focus is kind of tolerable,

72
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:12,140
to whatever intervention reveals that it's holding at STIP-IA.

73
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,080
But a very perché finding and some actually

74
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,900
here in the panelists.

75
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,760
And that will cream up more giving discussions

76
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,000
as we'll be spending more time explaining

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,060
what's going on in низanlass or ESPAN is,

78
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,940
and a lot of the last talk about how

79
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,200
We were

80
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,060
Tony

81
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:31,600
So

82
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,340
where

83
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,080
that

84
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,140
direction

85
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,560
that

86
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,640
experiment

87
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,240
we

88
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:44,980
thought

89
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,360
not

90
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:45,900
to

91
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,700
get

92
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,400
through

93
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:52,920
this

94
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,100
time

95
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:54,680
with

96
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,240
the

97
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:55,960
feeling

98
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,480
of

99
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:20,140
But the효x

100
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,140
~?

101
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:29,040
They're just a simplesmente

102
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:35,040
Female

103
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,440
Hat

104
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,160
you

105
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:51,000
so

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,960
which looked like it had Hag Choi because

107
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
when Harry says that, it is 1,000 years old.

108
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,080
It was just played, as it were,

109
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,540
in a prepare-gas 어디- XVIIIe century style

110
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,600
where director William Bush knew

111
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,120
that their rise was being determined

112
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,040
through magical match OK by Dr. William Bush 대해서

113
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,600
and Zhang and I personally think

114
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
that this game was quite the attempt

115
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,200
to enter the hearts of all muchas 해� probabilω

116
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,540
to gain back the Judit Saint

117
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,740
Artistic is time.

118
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,820
There are colleges of art in the U.S.

119
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,900
There are funding, father forces,

120
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,120
F1 camps inAA LA.

121
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,400
There are organizations that conceptually

122
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,440
do things the way their fast-growing

123
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,260
women should be doing maybe they're

124
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,000
the way their stockpile is.

125
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,260
For us it's essentially you go

126
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,180
andeh, take no action you lose.

127
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,520
It just adults make up.

128
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,180
Rogues…

129
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:57,540
So in terms of the

130
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:11,300
demand for this kind of

131
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:26,020
that our

132
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:40,900
Thanks for watching tonight.

133
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,020
starting in the fall of the 1980's.

134
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,900
So as you'll notice in this talk you've got Cet부as.

135
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,140
It's just, just a story for you IVitet's life.

136
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,680
I mean you figure, you can't write and edit your piece Tعمá está cant來了,

137
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,820
Toundár, just, just a third of all you got T UH unless you Uh Gesund ships you got

138
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,040
You're right, we are a younger generation.

139
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,740
And we need some of the myriads of what we got,

140
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,460
the weave of the mratulations, like Zupán you have that

141
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,540
the strings of the events being

142
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:40,540
bonjour

143
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,100
And so, Ms. sweepback, I'm looking at an idea

144
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,200
by Guessing Life that the Board of Governors

145
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,100
needs to work

146
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,080
together to North loan

147
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,720
J

148
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,480
and Judge

149
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,380
For the

150
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:08,240
S

151
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:21,640
the

152
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,500
Finally, the

153
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:36,800
investment

154
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,460
government

155
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:46,960
this

156
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,060
conference

157
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,980
All the challenges have occurred so that we will be pleased with or the

158
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:01,020
60 of our work to collect samples, collect samples to collect the hard

159
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:06,700
coffee we have produced, to collect and store the samples ourselves,

160
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,700
and to make that kind of action.

161
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,980
So, as an association, I am confident that we will be able to do this

162
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,740
that cooperative juiceers,

163
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,660
can really improve health !

164
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,060
so if we think about influence for this fish

165
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,900
in terms of fish stew喔

166
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,880
it can be either fish soup,

167
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,600
or it can be anything

168
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:36,140
it can even be fish pulling

169
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:42,700
That is the pregnant woman if you take a dive I fallen for it It's you know in the antiseptic

170
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:52,760
there is very little place for it in the

171
00:12:52,760 --> 00:13:02,020
You know the

172
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,020
I'm sorry

173
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,520
When to trust your personal cash and everything spirited

174
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,780
by private and public information only,

175
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,280
according to European degrutics.

176
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,940
If there is a cry for money that is donated on the blockchain...

177
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,480
Feel free to take it.

178
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,080
But this party does not only do it for a profit.

179
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,560
It helps financial support it has to make use,

180
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,200
because of it we are living and our business has to rest

181
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
And I think that's the most important thing.

182
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
And I think that's the most important thing.

183
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
And I think that's the most important thing.

184
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
And I think that's the most important thing.

185
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
And I think that's the most important thing.

186
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
And I think that's the most important thing.

And I think that's the most important thing.

00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
And I think that's the most important thing.

And I think that's the most important thing.

And I think that's the most important thing.

the

214
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,940
the

215
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:44,560
the

216
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,560
and I am the kind of person that works on both of them.

217
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,560
So, thanks for the interview.

218
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,560
So what does it mean to us to be a person who works on both of these things?

219
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,560
Actually, it means that we are in the same field,

220
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,560
and we are in the same field.

221
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,560
And that means that we are in the same field as we are in today.

222
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,560
So I would like to say that we are in the same field,

223
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,560
because we are in the same field as we are in today.

224
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,560
So it would be very, very good

225
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,560
if we are doing things that are especially important to us,

226
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,560
because it is so important to us to be a person who works on both of these things.

227
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,560
So, the first question is,

228
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
how do we get through this difficult time?

229
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
And if we are not able to do that,

230
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,560
how do we get through this difficult time?

231
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,560
And if we are not able to do that,

232
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,560
we have to have the more specific management of the system,

233
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
and it should be,

234
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,560
and if the system above usens differently,

235
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,560
then we should be able to wandering around a specific time.

236
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,560
By doing that,

237
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,560
we should be able to search the markets that are happening inside of us.

238
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,560
And that would be what knows the time that people work,

239
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,560
of dealing with the computer,

240
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,020

249
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:20,980
and all of it cannot be shared with any other teacher.

250
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,280
How?

251
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,600
But this is something very much possible,

252
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,980

the

258
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,380
to make this thing a föray, to address incident states,

259
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,500
because of the focus on community health care,

260
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,680
but also of photoeth групie networks,

261
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,100
which I'm quite impressed that

262
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,420
this project is efficiently and effectively

263
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,540
made to take the college students to college,

264
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,020
but we also made a fence for ODS players

265
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,040

And the first evening at the start of the forest, on the start of the starigMC show

especially from music

283
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,200
Finally we decided

284
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,660
we wanted to panelists who would be called on

285
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:28,900
So, to me it is was something different toCould you could you tell me the razos?

286
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:40,480
The sowie government of the UK have asked the UK government to

287
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,180
lift the talks off of now massacre.

288
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,080
It belongs to the UK.

289
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,020
the officer in crime...

290
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,820
he took the blood from a drink,

291
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,280
and dragged it through the blood to his doctor cathedral.

292
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,100
That is the conviction of drastic eviction

293
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,100
as a Ecuadorian artist,

294
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,100
noting anything sharp distinctive from this.

295
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,740
Unfortunately, the victim has just said

296
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,440
that this evidence may seem defiant,

297
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,840
but it bears no language.

298
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,340
And this deswegen, he puffed our elevatortor

299
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,760
and spat blood from the rely-man depth.

300
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,600
And how we can do this in different ways.

301
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:26,280
We felt likePut Keep want to teach her different concepts about what you average on a PC.

302
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,360
I have not had the opportunity to finish writing.

303
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,800
Momo, the team didn't really think about this.

304
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,520
We didn't set up this space but we have different ideas from India right now.

305
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,740
they talked with you what you wanted to do,

306
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,260
and you team decisions.

307
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,380
So one of the things you on stage thinks

308
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,480
is that you end up asking yourself

309
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,060
why do you care if 2008 bombs don't have time to amps ...

310
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,960
Some of the refugees

311
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,560
may have really limited Zeitung.

312
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,360
Because they have an accent.

313
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,360
So, this session in the idea is that

314
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,240
certain tries to battle the police

315
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,960
and��료 trusts that they are not given Genesys.

316

Finaly, provision of SSIT and SSRI Jahre

317
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,060
This will be included in this session

318
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,100
That is when it guards offensive

319
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,380

,aw wake up, upon saja sound

321
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,260
And then a small protest

322
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,160
that may seem a bit clunky

323
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,020
But it's OK

324
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,700
And finally, projection of SSIT

325
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,900
In the election booth

326
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,020
Shh, it was just kind of wasting time on rust,

327
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:43,760
We just need to take a closer look and find out what's really going on.

328
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:51,160
But it was one of those times when problems didn't come.

329
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,240
dressed as replicas.

330
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:53,920
The

331
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,160
Well, I compliment you.

332
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:56,420
We didn't even

333
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:56,640
Yeah,

334
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:56,720
Oh,

335
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,200
Yeah,

336
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,900
it came out.

337
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,320
So we need to do anything we can.

338
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:00,860
What are some of

339
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,320

what

343
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,200
We could

344
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,760
It is not in this case that it plans anything to do with legal.

345
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:14,120
We may fruits associates to different places and

346
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:24,720
such to get such evidence to say that thatwith the

347
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,920

I don't fit into stories these.

350
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:48,420
I just wanted to write something that was exactly what I wanted to really raise your attention to and it's generally SKINLAND.

351
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,420
I don't understand what this has to do with the UN from the outset.

352
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,220
Some basically, but many people are a meetings where photographed!

370
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,440
East

371
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,160
peninsula

372
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,820
of

373
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,780
where

374
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,780
Let

375
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,780
Still

376
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,120
Run

377
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,720
We

378
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,960
Our

379
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,260
project

380
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,320
because like a more, doesn't JOIN this, gehen a more nails...

381
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,820
that's what's great about it I think.

382
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,620
So theShoshua Dish and it seems like really good.

383
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:39,340
The main idea of the

384
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:48,840
gig is the

385
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,320
ίνlins ب excused by

386
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,400
having to bring thankfully

387
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,120
to.

388
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,840
Next.

389
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,920
That's what we could do.

390
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,020
I think that I'll use

391
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:11,940
the

392
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,500
hope

393
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,280
this

394
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,280
In the school, the best way to do this is to take a quick break,

395
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,280
and with time, we'll get back to the school, especially with

396
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,280
better schools, better communities, better schools, better

397
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,280
schools, especially in the future, we'll get back to the school

398
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,280
and we'll start to work on that.

399
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
But what we're going to do is we're going to start to create

400
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,280
a new school, and we're going to start to design a new school

401
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,280
that's going to be a different kind of school, a different

402
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
kind of school, and we're going to start to build a new school

403
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,280
that worth less now than it used to be in the school could ever

404
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
have been.

405
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:53,280
At the school how we are going to expand

406
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,280
in using training and introducing things to new students

407
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,280
how it's going, what we're going to do next, what we're

408
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:13,000
planning to try to do for a school

409
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,800
of course, making improvements.

410
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,080
Because they are able touk the efficiency

411
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,640
and the necessary capacity.

412
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,120
providing free of charge is the status of things

413
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,040
especially for children children without the right of

414
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,860
children without the necessary circumstances

415
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,320
With that, I think I've summarized so far.

416
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,200
A social practice is built to seller percent,

417
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,680
an actualita quality of legislation,

418
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,100
and before I'll show you...

419
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,720
I'm just expressing that in personal life,

420
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,960
which I do throughout my career.

421
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,560
Terminology is a type of social education

422
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,860
which really machine Core eligible.

423
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,360
This is justiendo dec renewal of general standards

424
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:40,460
So if you just liked reading it, utensil, wine, you won't be sacked for it.

425
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:55,800
Anyway, this is lot of products that you will need to know the whole taped screen

426
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,800
I'm trying to think of a way to make this process work.

427
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
I've been talking to myself a few times,

428
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
and I've been trying to make this work.

429
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,800
So I'm going to start by explaining the steps

430
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,800
that I've taken to make this process work.

431
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,800
I've said that this is a process that I've been doing

432
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
for a long time.

433
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,800
I've been doing this for a long time.

434
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,800
This is such a process that I can't even describe.

435
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:34,300
This is a process of

436
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,800
understanding people and discovering how to make

437
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,800
this different methods of Cameron.

438
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:57,240
They require you to submit COVID test in order to African American because the

439
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:11,760
public has efficient access to

440
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,560
good�- Drive to champaign you
