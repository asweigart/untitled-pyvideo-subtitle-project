26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,320
I would like to tell about some of this stars that you will see if you want to know more about

27
00:01:53,320 --> 00:02:05,200
What does the

28
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
that's the

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,240
main purpose of the

30
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
platform, and

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
what's interesting in terms of

32
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,240
the idea that we're

33
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
able to

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
communicate

35
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
across the platform

36
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,240
is that it's

37
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
not just the

38
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
basic idea of

39
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,240
the platform

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
but it's an

41
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
alternative.

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
And

43
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
that's what I found

44
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
in the

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
platform

46
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
for the

47
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
city council

48
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
in the

city council

54
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
is that

55
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
actually

56
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,960
the

00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
is

00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,200
the

Re소

62
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,000
that

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
is

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
the

the

our

That is, you can make a little error.

78
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,820
So you ignore that error when you like your own

79
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,140
service provider.

80
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:50,660
Friends of mine that

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:16,860
But Lekhalov the Russian

and that the patient has to be trained to detect how much blood and blood is in the bloodstream

88
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,640
and in the spleen or in the bloodstream with a little bit of blood flow.

89
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,640
And the doctor will be able to help us with our medication,

90
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,640
and the doctor will be able to give us a little bit of blood for the patient to be able to detect

91
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,640
and the doctor will be able to help us with the medication.

92
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:28,740

the same way as of basic consistency,

as time has been greatly

137
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,540
refracted by the personal

138
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:27,420
The

140
00:09:50,280 --> 00:10:02,800
This example is associated with the

It might be and this may be a positive and a lethal nee

It might even be a stroke.

145

So here in the hospital, my他在里其實是很清楚的,

00:10:49,200 --> 00:11:09,000
it's a very long forward record. 很長一段時間

and continue to do so.

148
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And it helps to have a sense of

149
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
everyone's valuable support

150
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
for these people's development.

151
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
This is what we use on a daily basis.

152
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The common TV.

153
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And...

154
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And...

155
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And...

156
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And this is what we use on a daily basis.

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We can use them for the

158
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
daily people, the daily society.

159
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And...

160
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And this is what we use on a daily basis.

161
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We can use them for the

162
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
daily people.

163
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
To recognize how

164
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
to receive more support

165
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
by those who may have

166
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
created the bestVOCI

167
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
to hide lid that

168
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
could hold more support

169
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
inside our level.

170
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We are like a

171
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
peching order

172
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,680
we have to cherish

173
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,000
the learning potential

174
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:31,360
example of the

175
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:55,360
I available to use in 600 ft heavy or rather 1,000 spearheads I'll show you here as well.

176
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,060
Bastion slowly excuses it being a pun.

177
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:23,980
They don't say there should be type

178
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,980
and they are not in the same package.

179
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,980
For example, in this case,

180
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,980
we have a package

181
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,980
that is made of

182
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,980
paper and

183
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,980
a certain type of paper.

184
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,980
So,

185
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,980
we can use this as a base

186
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,980
for the composition of the latest project

187
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,980
or we can use it as a base

188
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,980
where we have a different

189
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,980
type of paper.

190
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,980
So,

191
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,980
the composition package

192
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,980
is a different type of paper

193
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,980
and

194
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,980
the composition

195
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,980
is a different type of paper

196
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,980
for the composition

197
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,980
of the paper

198
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,980
and the design

199
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,980
of the paper can be defined

200
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,980
as a used paper

201
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,980
for the composition of the paper.

202
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,980
So,

203
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,980
we can use both of these

204
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,980
to define a composition

205
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,980
that is in the same package.

206
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,980
We can use both of these

207
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,980
to define a composition

208
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,980
where

209
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,980
the composition of the paper

210
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,980
is a different type of paper

211
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,980
for the composition

212
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,980
and the composition

213
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,980
of the paper can be defined as

214
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,980
a used paper

215
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,980
and the composition

216
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,980
of the paper can be defined as

217
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,980
a used paper.

218
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,980
So, when we are going to

219
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,980
design together

220
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,980
what,

221
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,980
as it are on the corner

222
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,980
bycherna

223
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,980
y,

224
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:05,980
袖

225
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,980
Aw,

226
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,980
aw,

227
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,980
aw,

228
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:19,720
Guys, I should say that the successful

229
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,040
bug-we're considered to be

230
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,240
a serious feature for our

231
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,720
population, especially

232
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,700
in minors, backgrounds,

233
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,200
TIA learning groups,

234
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,440
and parents, does anybody

235
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,600
feel different or different

236
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,800
It's different than I thought this evening,

237
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
when I took the cable phone call.

238
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,600
I said, I just had to go and take the cable,

239
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,400
and I had to go to the hospital in the morning,

240
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,400
and the hospital was a very busy time for me,

241
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,600
and I had to go to the hospital in the morning,

242
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,000
but it was really tough for me.

243
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So, this is the way that patients usually

244
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,800
get the cable phone call fast-working.

245
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,400
I was afraid of so many things in your life

246
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,800
that you could even get the person you performed the call to.

247
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,200
It's so scared, it's about, it's so,

248
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,000
what do you think about that cable?

249
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,600
What's the change in the service?

250
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Is it perfect?

251
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,600
How many teams are there?

252
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,800
And, especially in the capsule,

253
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,800
I had to take the cable from the product team.

254
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,000
And, when I went to the patient,

255
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
the patient was very excited,

256
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and I was very happy to be able to see.

257
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,800
I was surprised to see that the service

258
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,200
was really good for the patient,

259
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,800
and it was really nice and helpful for him.

260
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,000
And, I had a perfect idea to be

261
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
a specialist in the cancer support team,

262
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,600
and I was very proud.

263
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,000
So, I thought that, I had no problem

264
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
with the patient being able to get the patient

265
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,200
to do the service for me,

266
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,400
and I think that the patient was being able to

267
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,400
do it for me, and I was very proud to be able to

268
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,000
be able to be a part of the service.

269
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,400
So, I'm not going to be doing it

270
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,400
only because of the support staff.

271
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,000
I think the touch settings,

272
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
like the touch detection and the

273
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,200
actual depth of coverage,

274
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,000
I think, is really important.

275
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,800
I think the patient is really doing a great job

276
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,200
of being able to support the patients

277
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,600
from the patient's side of the project,

278
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,400
and a whole lot more.

279
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,400
Because it's a very far-fetched

280
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,900
work the years, your products,

281
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:53,200
drug abuse, and even other consumer

282
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,400
control services 착.

283
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:15,300
from Ohges' eldest son, Richard who

284
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,240
wrote the book, and said,

285
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,900
You were right, Richard.

286
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,460
When Richard, ninety-seven,

287
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,780
ask usually how would you

288
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,780
or a

289
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,780
community of these two

290
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,780
African-American people

291
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,780
in this country.

292
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,780
So you can find these

293
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,780
examples here. These are the

294
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,780
first examples of a truly

295
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,780
important and significant

296
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,780
intercultural place for it.

297
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,780
And I think this describes here

298
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,780
where we can also

299
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,780
expect or find a second

300
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,780
place for this.

301
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,780
The first thing is

302
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,780
the intercultural

303
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,780
place.

304
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,780
This is where we need to find

305
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,780
and find a second place

306
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,780
in that jurisdiction.

307
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,780
So, we can

308
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,780
find out here

309
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,780
a story from the community

310
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,780
of a region that we

311
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,780
are in. This is going to

312
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,780
be a very important

313
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,780
place for this.

314
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,780
And I think this is going to be a

315
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,780
very important place

316
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,780
for us because

317
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,780
we payups are

318
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,780
going to be providing

319
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,780
ill- obras

320
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,780
causes.

321
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,780
So when things come

322
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,780
into play,

323
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,780
we're expecting

324
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,780
a second place

325
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,780
of problem

326
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,780
and plainly

327
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,040
I think.

328
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,040
So, what can you do to prevent this from happening?

329
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,040
So, I think that the issue for our public health security

330
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,040
is that we have to have the right to do something with your kids.

331
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,040
We can see this, and we can only make the best of the way

332
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,040
that we can to make a difference in the future.

333
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,040
And that's what we're doing.

334
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:18,040
And so, we're doing this work, and we're also doing this work

335
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:24,040
in a very broad and technical way, and not only in the classroom,

336
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,040
but in our family home, and it is a direct and a personal attack

337
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,040
in the way that it's done, in our classroom.

338
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,040
And the basic concern is that we're not taking the difficult

339
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,040
steps that we used to when we were younger again.

340
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,040
We're not doing this for our family.

341
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,040
We are doing this for our children, because we're doing this

342
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
to understand the differences.

343
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,040
We just want to get more work, and maybe we're doing it

344
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,040
in a way that the differences are already.

345
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,040
And we're doing it in a way that our work and our work

346
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,040
and that's what we're doing.

347
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,040
And that it is true that we're doing it for our kids,

348
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,040
because we're doing it for our kids.

349
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,040
And I think that's why we're doing it.

350
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,040
We have a very big company, and we have a very big

351
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,040
team of people who have been helping us for the last few years.

352
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,040
And we try to get them to understand that this is a very

353
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:30,040
important thing for the children and the children of our community.

354
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,040
And so, I think that's why we're doing this work

355
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,040
in a very broad and technical way.

356
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,040
We have a very big team of people who are doing this work

357
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,040
in a very technical way.

358
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:48,040
And they are very involved with the content and the content.

359
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,040
And this is something that we're doing for the companies.

360
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:57,040
And, again, we're doing it very directly and we're doing it

361
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,040
for the community.

362
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,040
And we have a very big team of people who are working for our kids.

363
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,040
And we're doing it for the kids, and that's a very big

364
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,040
thing that's going on with our organization and with the

365
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
employees of the organization.

366
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,040
We have a very big team of people who are doing this work

367
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,040
in a very technical way.

368
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,040
And we're doing it for the kids, and we're doing it for the

369
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
kids, and we're doing it for the kids.

370
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,040
And I think that's why we're doing it.

371
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,040
And I think that's why we're doing it.

372
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,040
So that's something that we're doing for each time.

373
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,040
And we're doing it for each time, and I think that's very

374
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,040
important, something that we're doing for all teams in the

375
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,040
organization and for our communities.

376
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,040
So, yeah, I was very excited to open this webinar on our

377
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
campuses.

378
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:54,040
Because we basically decided, well, the frequencies we have

379
00:22:54,040 --> 00:23:15,220
These studies confirm how the

380
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,260
To make sure that everybody has some really nice

381
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,120
quality technical background,

382
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,740
I've also seen people come these things

383
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,280
that are sort of Robin Attroeana-themed.

384
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,400
And so, I believe one of the best practices

385
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,380
because it studs duckers and Oxford Archives

386
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,860
researches is to get early 12-year

387
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,660
skill shrimpingılan tinkering Maryland's

388
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,480
And using these tools, these marvels,

389
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,460
series of techniques and all that kind of things,

390
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,460
And so, you know, that's the number one effect.

391
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,460
And so, again, I don't think we should be talking about

392
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,460
in our series, and I'm just going to add these

393
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,460
little questions.

394
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,460
And so, for now, just kind of asking them

395
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,460
very broad questions.

396
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,460
And I just think that there are more strategies

397
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,460
and strategies that we can adopt

398
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,460
if we're going to take each step

399
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,460
in a different direction.

400
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,460
So, we're not going to be just going to be

401
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,460
going through each of these

402
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,460
different types of areas that we're going to be

403
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,460
competing in the next year.

404
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,460
And I think that's the key to learn

405
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,460
about social media.

406
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,460
Because it's a little bit complicated.

407
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,460
So, it's a little bit of a sub-general.

408
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,460
It's a little bit of a general de-general.

409
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,460
It's a little bit of a sub-general,

410
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,460
something that I've been doing, you know.

411
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,460
So, you know, it's a bit of a sub-general.

412
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,460
So, they are two main 5 material

413
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,460
for the method.

414
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,260
Article one, they are the

415
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,260
capsules for your problems for the

416
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,260
4G command-speed, and they're the

417
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,260
capsules that you can get for the

418
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,860
state of your life by the

419
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,460
mental and political account.

420
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,360
And so, it's sort of a remembered

421
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,360
practice, and the capsules,

422
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
they're the actual tools, they're the

423
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
big actors, which are the

424
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,460

00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,480

but we can't really rating honestly,

428
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,820
why we don't talk about it.

429
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,080
you can't...

430
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,120
the situation is such that

431
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,980
we couldn't share anything

432
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,980
this season with the company

433
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,960
we'll talk only a physically

434
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,960
if the storm could explain

435
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,940

436
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,260

some of your constituencies may have such an opinion

that you're an inspected person.

482
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,580
In that case, I assume

483
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,420
that the continued use of that conversation

507
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:19,340
However, what's this to be a picture of videos and photos that aren't inputted?

508
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,140
That's true.

509
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,180
So would the usage of words somewhere be helpful?

510
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,600
For photographers, this might be the best example for it be helpful.

this work was connected to a лайcm project

And so, the first thing that was discussed was the importance of contributing to data

546
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,020
education for men and women of color.

547
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,020
We got the place where it took a number of years to have the data out.

548
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,020
It was a very successful effort.

549
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,020
It was a very innovative effort.

550
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,020
It was a very successful effort.

551
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,020
It was a very successful effort.

552
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:21,020
And it was a very successful effort.

553
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,520
As I mentioned, we have a very young bacteria team ...

554
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:31,320
My two kids were in security critical care and we went through a process quite instantly
