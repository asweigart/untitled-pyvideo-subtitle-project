, I introduced you learn!

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,440
The goal of the application is to have upsampled

disp electronically.

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,880
I also support how you can express this

in a yellow ring by reporting a rarely read

24-hour experts on social media.

23
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,360
I'm taking this all the way towards performance

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,240
which I'm Asian.

If you haven't come across this before

28
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,900
I need you to write an official talk-book

29
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,040
about practices it can provide

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,600
is important to note that it's a way to have even more common

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,080
public support within oneself, because it fully opens

33
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,720
those projects, and even the governments that are finding

34
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,120
that, something can be done by providing funding

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,360
for those programs.

36
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,880
Today, we're going to be looking at the XF1 specifically

37
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,680
within what's really three places.

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Three places are the cultural packages, the cultural

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,720
collections, the cultural classroom code, and the rest

40
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,360
of the XF1 would be exactly the same, even during the

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,320
U.S. winter classroom experience.

42
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,000
So, especially in the winter, there are cultural

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,960
collections, where they are the ones that benefit

44
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,440
the public and especially the public.

45
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,480
Now, where users a pass their main solitary COVID

in the sp Junta case,

57
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,480
but they didn't represent a race

58
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,320
who must have previous dumplings

59
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,940
and Page Line notebooks and came out

60
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,860
during meetings and speeches but also

00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,280

and

64
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,240
and

65
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,980

rejected

73
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,340
and we've done some medicals.

74
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,200
There's a kind of support system.

75
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,000
But I'm going to give you a little bit of history.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,600
So I'll give you some examples of a little bit of things

77
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,200
done here.

78
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,800
If you want to know more, come to this today.

79
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,800
I'm going to give you a brief.

80
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,440
The accounts used by briefcase use essentially

81
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,600
the donuts to indicate the cost of the work

82
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,160
for the forms of the project that I'm going to be doing.

83
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,440
A briefcase application presents full copy

84
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,400
of all types of projects and full copies

85
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,080
of all of the accounts for statements.

86
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,320
A full copy of a copy of the printout.

87
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,800
And a sub-binary list of the lists

88
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,040
of the projects that I'm going to be doing

89
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,960
all about the work in my case with plus numbers of accounts.

90
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,840
I started using the humble part of the project

91
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,560
on the more accurate perspective,

92
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,040
which shows that projects could be a bit of a failover.

93
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,320
But on the plus number of rapid tables,

94
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,000
one of the many tools used to support this project

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,200
is by experience.

96
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
The sub-binary list of the direct accounts

97
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,760
that I'm going to be doing is a few ones

98
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,880
of the existing ones, plus one and two.

99
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,360
And if you go to the examples on the right,

100
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,440
plus one, the sub-binary is a thing

101
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,600
that you can use to actually decide

102
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,040
the best price is the next one you need

103
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,880
to be able to continue on with this project.

104
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,000
And that's pretty much it.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,800
Pre-cases are quite quick, but pretty much

106
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,360
the process for buying these records

107
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,680
is about six, six, three, the final dependencies,

108
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,200
and roughly the right whatever method

109
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,960
that I'm going to be using to make the payment.

110
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,520
Sorry to read you the range of the words,

111
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,040
but I'm sorry, it's part of the protection

112
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,080
of these projects.

113
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,000
Now, pre-cases can not be on the top

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,440
like it can be on the bottom, so why should you use

115
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,000
pre-cases but not the other components?

116
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,440
Well, that's not what it's waiting for.

117
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,680
Some alternatives are pre-cases,

118
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,320
but prior to that, it's important to know

119
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,080
some of the ways in which pre-cases are used.

120
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,920
So, what are pre-cases?

121
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,240
Well, you need to know the words in Italian.

122
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,640
And the way to use them is to be able to mix them together.

123
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,040
And I just looked at that in the painting,

124
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,920
which is important to me,

125
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,480
because I just placed it in a strictly

126
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,160
solid form, which is the type of code

127
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,000
that's on the top of the document.

128
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So, it's a very, very simple code.

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,480
If that approach won't work,

130
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,360
then it works if you print an address

131
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,320
using files as the use of space.

132
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,840
Doesn't work when you work with pre-cases.

133
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,920
One of the reasons for the hard task of code

134
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,200
is to find the correct one,

135
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
and then you can try to get the correct one

136
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,400
with a record of five or six.

137
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,600
And that's not the first type of one,

138
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,880
it's the first type of one that's over the record.

139
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,480
So, it's almost impossible to find the correct one

140
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,600
before that is the first type of code

141
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,000
that's in the kitchen, that's what you can try to

142
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,240
to intimidate people.

143
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,200
You want to make it doesn't fall into that

144
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,280
kind of thing, that's fine.

145
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,960
Pre-cases fall across a platform,

146
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,360
which means you have to figure out

147
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,200
how to find the correct one.

148
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,760
So, it's not the first way back,

149
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,080
but it's fine if it's not the only way.

150
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,520
And that means you don't have to be prepared

151
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,240
to figure out how to use this particular method.

152
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,080
So, you only have the potential to use those methods.

153
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,840
So, how do you use pre-cases?

154
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,640
Well, the easiest approach is to start by

155
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,520
using pre-cases for pre-cases.

156
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,040
Create a virtual environment, install pre-cases,

157
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,480
and things called pre-cases.

158
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,120
Pre-cases include your wizarding and

159
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,640
started in-person, so that's what pre-cases mean.

160
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,520
And you'll be presented with a list of questions

161
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,760
that's going to be explained in pre-cases

162
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,720
to exactly what pre-cases are going to be used for.

163
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,600
To be able to find a form of evidence

164
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,920
that I'm going to show you,

165
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,000
you need a copy of the evidence,

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,520
a question of evidence, a list of evidence

167
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,280
of what you're keeping.

168
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,800
You'll be asked to write a bundle

169
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,040
that is at least sometimes a small statement

170
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,880
to say, correct me if I'm wrong,

171
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,080
but I'm not sure if you want me to look at this.

172
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,320
Now, I didn't say a form of evidence

173
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,640
is my answer, but it's usually at your worst

174
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,680
or at your best, and you're not in control.

175
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,400
You have to find a way to look at the fact

176
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,240
that you're not in control,

177
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,640
because that's what you're going to be looking for.

178
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,960
So, you can ask someone

179
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,040
to write a form of evidence that you're keeping

180
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,120
when you're looking at the evidence.

181
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,400
You can ask about project management,

182
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,440
in this case, project management,

183
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,360
which includes both of those two different factors.

184
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,400
You'll be asked to write one

185
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,560
that is different from the previous one.

186
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,840
You'll be asked to write a form of evidence

187
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,000
that is at your best,

188
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,080
and you're not in control.

189
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,800
So, you can ask about what you're keeping.

190
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,280
You have to find a way to look at the project.

191
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,560
I'm asking someone to write a form of evidence

192
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,400
that you're keeping,

193
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,320
because that's what you're going to be looking for.

194
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,240
You'll be asked to write a form of evidence

195
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,960
that you're keeping,

196
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,600
or you can say, correct me if I'm wrong,

197
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,760
but I'm not sure if you want me to look at this.

198
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,000
When you protect the business,

199
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,200
you've got to find a way to look at the fact

200
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,880
that you're not in control.

201
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,760
If you look at that,

202
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,400
you'll be told that you're keeping it.

203
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,560
What you're keeping is a complete self-project

204
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,880
that is really an up-project,

205
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,720
a solid-end,

206
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,520
a professional concept that informs

207
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,240
and encourages the next day.

208
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,640
You get the same style

209
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,000
as the private support from the trade-off

210
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,440
between the individual and the content,

211
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,520
the up-project style,

212
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,680
something that is more complex,

213
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,400
and some of those are more complex

214
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,040
than the individual's voices.

215
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,480
So, quite quickly, the pilot gets into the work.

216
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,280
I'm speaking with the content and style

217
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,720
of action, action, stage, and sketchy leaders.

218
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,840
All the brief constructions I've outlined

219
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,800
include the pre-credits,

220
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,640
the end-of-the-year, the final,

221
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,240
and the end-of-the-season subjections.

222
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,440
The top-level project

223
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,120
of all the writing of the magazine

224
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,200
includes the four-week

225
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,600
and the top-level project,

226
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,560
and the subject of the magazine.

227
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,280
Individual tasks are then defined

228
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,880
in the overall text of the style.

229
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,400
This configuration here is defined

230
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,760
in the overall text of the magazine,

231
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,720
with a form of a font,

232
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,840
a little bit of a loop,

233
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,000
and so on.

234
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,640
At runtime, the configurations are

235
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,000
available at the end of the season,

236
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
so it's a bit of a project series,

237
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,040
probably one that most people

238
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,480
may be inspired by the end-of-season.

239
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,680
So, these are not the pieces that

240
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,200
I'm going to be doing quite closely.

241
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,760
It will be shared once on the project

242
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,360
that I'm going to be doing

243
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,240
in the next 20 minutes or so.

244
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,520
If you want to get a few

245
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,400
minutes of that short,

246
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,920
it's not a project.

247
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,960
It's a piece that by adding

248
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,120
a little bit of a long-term thing

249
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,520
into your work.

250
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,280
The most important part of the city

251
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,160
doesn't include

252
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,040
follow-up work that I've done

253
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,880
in the last few weeks.

254
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,920
So, it's a wide range of space

255
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,880
and the point of the format

256
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,560
that we need to present

257
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,400
by the end of the season.

258
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,200
So, it's a place where you can

259
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,640
develop your own

260
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,520
team of general ideas and studies.

261
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,480
On some platforms,

262
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,200
we have to provide

263
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,120
multiple platforms,

264
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,640
including revolutions,

265
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
and on some sites,

266
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,400
we're going to be able to

267
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,760
find a way to increase the attention.

268
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,320
I say that wraps up this project

269
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,800
but I'll tell you two things.

270
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Four examples of this

271
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,960
work are the following.

272
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,400
First, the files that are

273
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,640
supported in the case of the project.

274
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,200
Sources defines the link

275
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,840
to our directives of source code,

276
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,360
e-model, and code in the element.

277
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,640
So, here we have a source

278
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,720
follow-up matrix,

279
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,120
any code or resource

280
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,200
in the project will be

281
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,360
funded together.

282
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,920
It's left to be specified by

283
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,880
multiple sources in one

284
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,960
form or another funding.

285
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,080
It's only going to be

286
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,960
funded by multiple source

287
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,360
respirators,

288
00:09:35,360 --> 00:10:02,600
we have steps that are

289
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,940
and a few other things.

290
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,900
So you define it as a source of different things.

291
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,060
So what is it for?

292
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,800
It's an app where the source is in the app

293
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,580
and you can provide it as a source of different things.

294
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,020
Why do we have a lot of people, and also a special one,

295
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,740
because there are platform systems.

296
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,340
I've already explained this in the form of platform.

297
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,940
We generate a class object in Powerbomb,

298
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,660
and it uses functions of all the platforms

299
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,460
that are present in the content box.

300
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,300
So that's what's the next week's focus on in the main web.

301
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,900
So here, we've got the specific actions.

302
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,740
So in that case, the options were only

303
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,240
to create that class group of the actions.

304
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,880
So if you've got social surprise,

305
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,840
for instance, you test the full-result of the events

306
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,040
in the community, so it immediately

307
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,480
forms a class group of all the problems

308
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,560
that are present in the content box in the previous class.

309
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,840
But they'll also include the content based on the actions.

310
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,500
I don't want to bring that up, but it will also

311
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,600
have the function of one type of the content

312
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,200
that is in the same event as the one that's

313
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,400
on the same instance.

314
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,440
All other things will provide that web

315
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,840
in particular, that means it's not a competitive

316
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,420
class, but a specific or competitive class in the same way.

317
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,300
For most platforms, one needs to go back

318
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,920
a little bit back to the distribution,

319
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,420
though, because many times the great things

320
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,740
are not really different.

321
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,380
Now, this particular group has support

322
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,940
for local packaging for that story,

323
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,420
but many sections, for example, in the same spot,

324
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,540
have all related traffic and files,

325
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,420
but there are different forms that form

326
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,980
a specific section.

327
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,620
So I just want to break that down a little bit,

328
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,300
just so you can see, this is the package

329
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,700
for the leadership to basically write down

330
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,860
the lines in order to complete the event,

331
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,040
for the next time it happens in the case.

332
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,480
So there is obviously a double-edged sword,

333
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,080
but for all sections, you should also

334
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,640
add this is the better user, so you have

335
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,280
the moon troops for the packages,

336
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,960
which is the left of the board, so for the lords,

337
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,120
this is the community, and the leaders.

338
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,080
These sections are defined as a sequence of requirements

339
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,240
in relation to different packages of the images

340
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,840
in your components without any other means of usage.

341
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,400
This shows all such support sections

342
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,040
in the flight path that we saw last time

343
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,440
with the configuration section.

344
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,300
This is about flight path of the department,

345
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,780
it just seems to have been generated for you

346
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,340
by request, and you thought you thought

347
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,180
you had to use that system, but you thought

348
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,220
it makes it super important to you,

349
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,460
because what you have in your space

350
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,980
can be much more than a path project,

351
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,900
and by the way, it only required that the request

352
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,460
was in the code base, because you had

353
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,300
a full-edged sword application for the free data,

354
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,140
so the free data basically would not be in your code,

355
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,940
same as your images, so it's not redundant,

356
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,900
but it's not redundant, but it's not a path file,

357
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,460
so it's not a file.

358
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,020
What that is and what it does is it's part of an idea,

359
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,980
and what it included is what's the different ones

360
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,000
that you would expect to generate.

361
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,840
Okay, so how are you creating it?

362
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,800
You've got a free space for your own

363
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,880
free data products that you're using.

364
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,520
Well, the first thing you want to do is take a speak

365
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,960
to your app, and it's going to tell you,

366
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,280
free space is created and developed,

367
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,520
and it's going to take you to references

368
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,200
and recommendations for your team.

369
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,280
You've got a free space here, free space

370
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,200
for you to use in a project or a public product,

371
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,720
where you can out-rank your project

372
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,800
in your local flexible model.

373
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,960
First, you want to do this in a space

374
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,800
where people will go to cloud services,

375
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,200
and then you want to start your own.

376
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,720
So you can plug the design,

377
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,040
anybody can free-trade here,

378
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,940
and then you can start your own.

379
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,580
Free space is really one of the things

380
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,820
that shows you how to create your own.

381
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,020
I'm giving you a little bit of a synopsis

382
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,460
of why that's going to be kind of tough for you,

383
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,860
followed by how to run this in a whole world

384
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,700
where you don't have to do that.

385
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,540
So I'm going to give you a couple of examples

386
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,540
of how you can use free space

387
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,100
in a public product for your own free space.

388
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,940
On such a device that is in the same space

389
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,700
as a computer-free desktop,

390
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,100
free space will run as an app for your team,

391
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,660
and it will run as a website, and it will run as a service.

392
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,260
So that's one example of how you can use free space

393
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,720
in a public project.

394
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,420
If all you've got is the content you're going to want to do,

395
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,320
at this point, what you get is a great way to make

396
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,080
the community a better place for you to work with you.

397
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,760
You can make your computer write a code in your app

398
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,000
and switch it to the files within the computer.

399
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,160
So that's how you can help the app run its code

400
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,640
for as a service, one free space,

401
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,520
two free apps, and one free web.

402
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,160
Those are the four most important parts

403
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,640
of how to run a free space in the app.

404
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,240
The next one is the one that I'm going to teach

405
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,600
you in a minute, and it's how to join up

406
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,320
with your users.

407
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,000
First step, you'll forget to do a bit of this,

408
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,400
when you press the forget.

409
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,680
This will do a bunch of business space,

410
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,460
and you'll forget to do a quick full hot file on your phone.

411
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,820
I always end up with a bunch of things

412
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,220
that I've left full of that stuff.

413
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,000
So I'm going to put a link in the description

414
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,820
of the video, and I'll give you a link

415
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,740
to the full hot file on your phone.

416
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,860
Second, you'll forget to do a bunch of support packages.

417
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,340
The support packages are usually the ones

418
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,820
that are possibly going to be built into your app.

419
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,140
But we know that you can switch between

420
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,860
a single package or a double package,

421
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,580
so every other platform will be available

422
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,100
to support your package.

423
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,260
So whatever your platform is,

424
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,900
it's best to have one that's a couple of weeks

425
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,260
of untapping, and it's best to have one

426
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,660
that's a couple of weeks for those.

427
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,440
And then you break down the storage application code,

428
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,600
and it becomes the sixth essential for the project.

429
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,280
It can download and install for app performance,

430
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,000
but it's often installed on things that are in the

431
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,320
list that are actually in the list,

432
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,000
and it's also in the application for the project.

433
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,520
You are using it on things like distribution,

434
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,360
it's a software model, it's in station,

435
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,560
and it's really like a local virtual platform.

436
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,720
Then you break down the storage,

437
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,840
and the application for the storage of your platforms,

438
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,680
how is it going to be in the content,

439
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,520
because they're in the content,

440
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,520
and the resource, for example,

441
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,680
in the port of the storage platform,

442
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,880
you don't need the platform.

443
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,260
You can download it on the platform,

444
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,580
and it's fine.

445
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,100
And then as you're now logged on to the three applications

446
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,500
that are in the project directory,

447
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,340
you're now going to have a new folder

448
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,740
that contains the contents of the same content for the project.

449
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,900
Next thing, don't be a hunk of shit.

450
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,060
That's not going to stop the year,

451
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,540
that's not going to stop the year.

452
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,540
What happens this year is very surprising.

453
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,220
That all of our methods and things could be

454
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,340
not much better than the one we've been using.

455
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,660
The Windows, things we want to do,

456
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,740
the data we want to use,

457
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,780
it's going to be a lot faster.

458
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,100
And it's quite difficult to get stuff

459
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,680
because of the way the content of the content

460
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,880
and that process is.

461
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:31,780
But what we have

462
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:37,560
is a lot faster than the one we used.

463
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,640
And what you can do is,

464
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,480
and I'm writing this down,

465
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,520
it's very similar to the story we've written before,

466
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,440
but it has a couple of different features.

467
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,440
It's actually a few things

468
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,480
that we've been operating since we've built Windows,

469
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,920
we'veИ got a bunch of denkeys is there any way

470
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,580
we can put things together perfectly

471
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,440
and make things look a lifter around the little bit.

472
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,980
I mean, we've probably gone a little bit faster

473
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,720
based on how we Turner this 너무.

474
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,120
Well, if you like it, you have to get things outside,

475
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,100
but if you really can't,

476
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,300
really go to the side of correctness

477
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,380
where you are,

478
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,220
you're not fine.

479
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,300
So one thing that we've done

480
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,460
really is pancakes this year and strives to get issues

481
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,100
that might be a problem in the future.

482
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,460
But the good thing is,

483
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,460
in fact,

484
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,220
rather than be totally stop giving up,

485
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,960
a large chunk of this non- الذي

486
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,960
and then we can find the right section and then find the right

487
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
section and then we can develop it into a fixed project.

488
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,960
Whatever the project is, we can do it in the same way.

489
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,960
So you can't get to that page at present.

490
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
You can only do one of those things in the project class

491
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
when we go in. The project class is a fixed project

492
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
and we don't have to do it in the program.

493
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,960
We go in the same way as we did in the previous project.

494
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
We've got documentation of the project

495
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,960
that's coming from mobile platforms and services

496
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,960
that we want to make it.

497
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
So in this package, we've developed a

498
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,960
complete program of the package.

499
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,960
So the framework of the program is basically the specifics of that program.

500
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,960
The final one is the core of the package, which is the

501
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,960
basic programs.

502
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,960
If our limits are not perfect, then another

503
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,960
is to be changed. So in this case, we can

504
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,960
define a model for the model for training

505
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,960
and we can use a document.

506
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,960
In this case, we're going to see five places in the

507
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
program used in the project for the

508
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
complete program.

509
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
The first is the task-based target.

510
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
We can work with the students and bring them to the package

511
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
and then we can fill that package.

512
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
If you want make-ups, you can also do a package

513
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
for the next project.

514
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
We can use a bunch of documents and

515
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
then we can do the second part of the treat.

516
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
Of course, in other cases, we can also do a

517
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
one-on-one course. The other one is the course of

518
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
testing on the web.

519
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
So we can do a one-on-one course for the

520
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
project. So that's what we're doing.

521
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
So you are testing your web framework for this project.

522
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
So the package fell out.

523
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
We've integrated it to our users.

524
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
Let me start with one person here.

525
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
We need to go through this whole deployment process again.

526
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
So you are finding ways to build training

527
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
for the..."享受?"

528
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
process.

529
00:17:46,960 --> 00:18:01,960
So now maybe you guys just some

530
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,960
great samples of money.

531
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
You know, we used to have a sock

532
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,720
store.

533
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,940
Now we're so in touch with the

534
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,940
so that they can accept customers.

535
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,940
So most customers have a product that they can product

536
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,940
and accept the product, rather than a product that

537
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,940
for instance, you can't protect from an injury

538
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,940
or an average of such activities.

539
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,940
Three cases of injury and such type

540
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,940
will create a little bit of trouble.

541
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,940
Three cases of injury are so important

542
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,940
that we are afraid to say that if you have a first product

543
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,940
that you've got a first-time injury,

544
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,940
or you have a first-time injury,

545
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,940
three cases of injury can be a little bit of a challenge.

546
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,940
So we should do the same thing every time.

547
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,940
Three cases also allows for an increase in the number of people around you

548
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,940
that are flexed after four years of use.

549
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,940
So during the final development cycle for that,

550
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,940
you can see the number of people who are getting around one issue

551
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,940
over the next year or so.

552
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,940
Three cases of injury is not a challenge

553
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,940
because it enables a single project.

554
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,940
And typically, a single project like a first-time injury

555
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,940
is about being a product that you can use to do the first part of the project.

556
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,940
It is about the number of investors who are expecting the audience

557
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,940
to be able to get around the project.

558
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,940
So if it's a doping injury, it will open a sales site

559
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,940
that will be in the doping department and use to do it today.

560
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,940
So let's talk about what we're about to talk about in more detail.

561
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,940
So let's look at exactly the size of this deal.

562
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,940
So I have these four units of the process.

563
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,940
Three cases of injury as five months, three cases of injury as five months.

564
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,940
So we have three cases of injury as five months.

565
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,940
So they'll come out five weeks later,

566
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,940
but I think they're about that much because you know,

567
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,940
you can't just go to the site and start doing your work

568
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,940
with a few weeks later and possibly a few weeks later.

569
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,940
When you run a brief test, run it on a regular basis,

570
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,940
brief test the process, make it look like the product,

571
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,940
and it will look for the simulated size of the one you're using

572
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,940
to set up a new supply and is to choose from.

573
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,940
If you want to look at the question of,

574
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,940
is this product going to be used for a given number of times

575
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,940
and how many times are you going to be able to work with,

576
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,940
what kind of product are you using, what kind of product are you going to use,

577
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,940
and what are the risks to that product?

578
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,940
It's either the review is the type of product that you're going to be using

579
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,940
or the product that you're going to be using,

580
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,940
and the answer is the product that you're using.

581
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,940
You can also work with the question of is the product

582
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,940
is going to be breaking the connection of the image of the product

583
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,940
to another image.

584
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,940
But once you get to the bottom, what you're saying is something

585
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,940
that works is I always think about the different products

586
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,940
that you might be using for a different kind of business

587
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,940
processes that I'm just going to be writing.

588
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,940
The one you're going to be writing is the one that you're writing

589
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,940
is going to be using in that connection of the audience.

590
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,940
You can run it that way to get the good advice.

591
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,940
It's not going to be a complete exception.

592
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,940
It's going to be an extremely complex problem for the user

593
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,940
since you're starting the business of the product.

594
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,940
You're going to be working with the potential product

595
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,940
from a technical perspective.

596
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,940
One thing you'll want to think about is if you're in any

597
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,940
physical connection with it,

598
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,940
the ability to be able to receive a physical

599
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,940
exchange from the customer, I think would be best health

600
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,940
as of the top of the house.

601
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,940
Unlike most normal resistance kits that we've had

602
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,940
on our Al marché and the Alatics we have,

603
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,940
what it does is it operates in a manner that

604
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,940
can catch this problem and really Ve-meet

605
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,940
in that situation.

606
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,940
When it's not locked or locked, this new product

607
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,940
essentially drops below.

608
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,940
GPT is a endeavour

609
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,940
to academia

610
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,940
and wallet

611
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,940
consequences

612
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:14,940
.

613
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:24,940
The

614
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,380
This is the kind of place we can get some work.

615
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:51,360
So if I was encouraging the

616
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,880
this one, both the bell and the bell, the impact of death in the one and this one.

617
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,440
So if you run a test, please, why would it all be possible?

618
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
It's not that they're generated by free-trace births.

619
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,640
It's that they're caused by conscious, that they're caused by the ability to

620
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,200
be this way, this way, this way, that way, that way, that way.

621
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,720
So if I can use it, I mean, I've got it.

622
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,560
So it's one of the most common things that we can do in the US, but it's also

623
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,400
a good way to get the best results.

624
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
So, yeah, it's a good way to get the best results.

625
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
It's a good way to get the best results.

626
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Yeah, it's a good way to get the best results.

627
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,000
All right, so in terms of the common question we've got, it's the single most

628
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,240
common question from free-trace to work-generals.

629
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,120
Like what runs on the board when we've got the one relative?

630
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,120
This is because we're doing a lot of runs on your local virtual environment.

631
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,680
Rob, you essentially found out that one, if you keep installing something locally,

632
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,440
like you've got a body that's got a couple of times, it can develop a bit.

633
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
This was done the right way, you've got quite a bit.

634
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,400
So the package which you made at the end of the one is what's been added.

635
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
And you look at the update, what is that?

636
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
And you look at the update, what is that?

637
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
So that'll come up in the questions.

638
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,400
First question is, is it only as we have really large tools for examples?

639
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
And what is the relationship between the one relative and the other?

640
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
There is a specific set of ways of running this.

641
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,400
One type that is the typical performance is a set of data that you would project

642
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
down on the level of the public health.

643
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,400
First type does what it's said, but it's not common to say that that's not perfect.

644
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Sometimes it's not common to make sure that the person is using the results that

645
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
come out.

646
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,400
This case, first one is not basically the same as the first one, but it has a lot of

647
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
uses.

648
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
First one is a little bit more practical than the first one.

649
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,400
First one is how we run the tool, and second one is how do we do the test,

650
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
which is how do we analyze that data?

651
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
And third one is how does this work in my way?

652
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,400
So you take the data, you go to all the research, you go to the first one,

653
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
you can find this stuff.

654
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,400
That's pretty easy to use, and you can do it to be flexible with the tool,

655
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,400
but you have to have the data that's not like one relative or this relative type of

656
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
data that doesn't look like a detection point.

657
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,400
So you have to have a very flexible right, and you can do it to be flexible.

658
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,400
So why do you just use tables and boards instead of a database?

659
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
So what about third type?

660
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,400
Well, when you're thinking of looking for a tool present on the site,

661
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
you're already looking at pretty much the test user.

662
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
So if you have a policy that you don't need to apply,

663
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
so you can say that you've got a data set that's not perfect,

664
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,400
but it's not completely flexible, and you can say that it's not perfect

665
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
for the users.

666
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,400
You might think that's actually bad, but it's not.

667
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
It's not perfect.

668
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
It's not perfect.

669
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
That's not the end of the game.

670
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,400
And then the third one is a little bit complicated.

671
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
There's no boundary layer, because that's what it's supposed to be.

672
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
It's supposed to be interactive.

673
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,400
So I'm worried about what boundary layer is next to what.

674
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
So you can use those as a bunch of things on the site,

675
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,400
like a published file, which is what we're going to use.

676
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
This is the stuff that I think we're going to use.

677
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
In fact, the two layers is only very complicated.

678
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
So you can use boundary layers, but what we're saying is that

679
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,400
we might use the same thing that takes us out of the public space,

680
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,400
where we're just going to have a pre-set view of the data type.

681
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
So I think we want to start that two-layer list.

682
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
You're fine with that.

683
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
It isn't.

684
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,400
The reason we're doing it, we're going to kind of say that

685
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,400
this is one of the guidelines that we want to do this,

686
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
and we're coming here.

687
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,400
In the main numbers, we're going to start that two-layer list,

688
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
and we're going to start all the reasons you could probably do that.

689
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,400
That's just the other packages that I'm going to spend time on.

690
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
So that's kind of how we're going to do it.

691
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Unfortunately, it's time to find a way to see if we can actually

692
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,400
start typing in the top of the list, which is what we're going to do.

693
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Because it's going to be a full-page list of what we're going to do,

694
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
and we're going to start with the main numbers,

695
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
and then we're going to start with the next number.

696
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
So that's two-layer.

697
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
These things are not physically clicked on.

698
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
These things, it works well, and it works well,

699
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,400
but it's going to be a little bit too fast.

700
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
I'm going to show you some of the obvious kind of requirements

701
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
for the production of some stuff that's possible.

702
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
So I'm going to be packaging some of it,

703
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
and it works better for you next time.

704
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
And I think it's easy to do that once you look at the request

705
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
and the quality of the data.

706
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
So it's a little bit harder to do that, so I'm going to show you

707
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
some of the requirements.

708
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
So this is the kind of program that we use

709
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
for our data creation, which is the right-hand side.

710
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
So the left-hand side, what we're going to do is

711
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,400
we're going to look at the data, and that's what the four things

712
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
include in the data code that we use in the right-hand side.

713
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
So this is the one that I use most frequently.

714
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
They are the most frequently used one in the whole world,

715
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
and it comes with a set of functions,

716
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
which is the ability to essentially do the same thing.

717
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
So you have the ability to actually do the same thing

718
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,400
in the complex, but it works in a way that you can't do in the field.

719
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
We also like to take our best,

720
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
and we have all the tools that we use to do our work,

721
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
so it comes with four, and it's the only one that's been

722
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
used in the past, and it's the only one that's been used in the past.

723
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
A lot of that is in the voice of the person

724
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
who has the best platform for the

725
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
deep functions, and it's the same stuff that is in the people's voice.

726
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Last week, we took a presentation

727
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
in the ReefPost countries, and it was done for the packaging

728
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
of the person who came into the room.

729
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
However, next week, we will have a presentation

730
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
to give you a little bit more about it, so I think it's a great

731
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
chance for you to learn a little bit more, too.

732
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
And that's great, thanks for coming.

733
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
If you've worked your way through the day,

734
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
I'm sure you've come to the end.

735
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
In the community, I think most of the other registered companies

736
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
are not registered, but I think that's going to be a little bit of a

737
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
work. After everything that's been done today,

738
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
and it's come to a great place, we're having a public

739
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
consideration of what we can do in the future, and I think

740
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
that's a great thing. And if you want to know more

741
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
about the process of bringing custom-setting into function,

742
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
please stay in the center. I've had a lot of

743
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
meetings with folks who say they're COVID-19

744
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
and I'm assuming there's cases that don't even

745
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
exist. But there is a special

746
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
company called Customs and Center of Customs

747
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
in the country, so I think it's a really good one.

748
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
It's a key feature of my company,

749
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
and it's that kind of thing called ReefPost.

750
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
It's a company that's been doing a lot of

751
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
research on the COVID-19 pandemic, and it's a

752
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
company that's been doing a lot of research on the COVID-19 pandemic.

753
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
In terms of the resources that we raise,

754
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
I'm sure there's a lot of things like that.

755
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
What has been a tough time in terms of

756
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
working on the COVID-19 project itself,

757
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,400
it's been difficult to find the right

758
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,400
people to work with, and it's been a tough time.

759
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
We've also got a few schools that have discussed

760
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
the forms to be tried for specific projects,

761
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
such as the COVID-19 COVID-19 project.

762
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
More is working on the COVID-19 thing.

763
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
We are always looking for new contributors, and we have

764
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
since been找 by the producers that have mentioned

765
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,400
that there are friends that have been trying to work

766
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:50,240
on Bless

767
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,520
it.

768
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,820
He was just a quick gentleman by the way,

769
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,640
but full of everywhere.

770
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,640
He did use his head on a drink

771
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,580
when he published anバッ planned for invest.

772
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,200
I露e not that this is not one of those

773
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,380
intoxicated conversations with other people

774
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:11,400
high黑 ng

775
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
And I think that's a very important point.

776
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,400
And I think that's a very important point.

777
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,400
And I think that's a very important point.

778
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
And I think that's a very important point.

779
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,400
And I think that's a very important point.

780
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
And so the question is, is there a way

781
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
to get the right experience for the people

782
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
who are just not going to be able to do it?

783
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,400
And I think that's a very important point.

784
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
And I think that's a very important point.

785
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
And I think that's a very important point.

786
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
And that's why we didn't really know why

787
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
this would exist, and why.

788
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,400
It just didn't happen, it just went with the flow.

789
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,800
And it's true.

790
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,320
These reasons這邊 Wir أجلس

791
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,820
But you just don't have the answers.

792
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,780
And thanks so much for coming on the panel

793
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,780
to talk with us today.

794
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,780
So, it's great that you're here.

795
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,780
I'm excited to be here.

796
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,780
I'm excited to be invited for this.

797
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,780
which is really interesting.

798
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,280
It's a bit like the other ones.

799
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,780
It's a bit like the ones in the specific platform.

800
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,780
And it's interesting.

801
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,780
It's interesting.

802
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,780
It's not really the kind of things that we're used to.

803
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,780
But what it's like to be in a place that's

804
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,780
really interesting is for it to be something that's

805
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,780
not just true, but it's also really unique.

806
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,780
So let's talk about the things that we think about.

807
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,780
So we have the public telemetry, public telemetry,

808
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,780
public telemetry, which is what telemetry is,

809
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,780
and it's positive.

810
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,780
And it's important.

811
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,780
And then basically, thank you, Jeff, for your answer.

812
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,780
So I'll start with something that's

813
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,780
true as to how important it is to our society.

814
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,780
It's a lovely value that we want to accept.

815
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,780
We have to know it's something that we can't be

816
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,780
too sure of.

817
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,780
And so I'm going to leave that with you.

818
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,780
In terms of what's considered a good thing,

819
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,780
a good thing about this, one of the key areas

820
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,780
that we've come to is the social media.

821
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,780
So social media, which is, let's say,

822
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,780
a good thing about this, a little bit more

823
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,780
to the point that it's not really a good thing.

824
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,780
But then we've got a couple of people who are

825
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,780
interested in it, who are interested in it,

826
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,780
and we've got people who are interested in it.

827
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,780
So I'm going to leave this out of the way for now.

828
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
Thanks.

829
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,780
Do we have any questions?

830
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,780
I think that's a very good question.

831
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,780
I think that's one of the things that we need to think

832
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,780
about when we think about social media.

833
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,780
And I think that's a good point.

834
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,780
It's not that we're not thinking about

835
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,780
that much, but we need to think about

836
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,780
what we're doing with social media.

837
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,780
And I think that's one of the things that we need

838
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,780
to think about.

839
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,780
If I could honestly, I think the new way

840
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,780
to call it is that this press is now being controlled

841
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,780
by the press, which is going to be a very

842
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,780
important thing for you.

843
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,780
You're going to be able to go to a social media

844
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,780
page, you're going to be able to take a picture of it,

845
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,780
take a picture of it, and then you can take a picture

846
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,780
of it.

847
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,780
And then also, it's a great way to take a picture

848
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,780
of it, and this is something that you can do.

849
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,780
It may come from a couple of different platforms.

850
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,780
And I think that's a great point.

851
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,780
I think the production of it is a very happy

852
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,780
little bit of one.

853
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,780
It's a good one.

854
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,780
It's a good one.

855
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,780
It's a good one.

856
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,780
And I think that's one of the things that we need

857
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,780
to think about when we think about social media.

858
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,780
That's my last question.
