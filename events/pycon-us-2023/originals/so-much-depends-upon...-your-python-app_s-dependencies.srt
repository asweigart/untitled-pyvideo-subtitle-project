1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, we're going to start with everyone's own thoughts.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So, we're going to start with everyone's own thoughts,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
each one of you, about the vision of the agencies

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and the current experience that you have with them.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Now, I'm going to read.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Thank you.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Thank you.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is a very important question.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is a very important question.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So, what's the most important thing in the process?

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, the vision of the agencies is to be able to

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
engage with the current experience,

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and in fact, to engage with the current experience

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and to start with the current experience

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
to talk to the agencies about the future,

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and the future.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So, what's important is to start with the vision

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
of the agencies and the current experience,

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and the future.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So, what's the most important thing in the process?

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So, what's the most important thing in the process

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
is to engage with the current experience

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and the current experience.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So, what's the most important thing in the process?

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So, department of leadership.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now, I'm going to it up one,

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
but it goes.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,040
First time that accessibility,

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,040
not just access, one person may have an access point

30
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,300
and at certain points it is,

31
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,880
with a predominant collaboration energy,

32
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,680
that is not connected.

33
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,940
Fun 왜 we talk about this,

34
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,940
the risk of Grab will be the most obvious.

35
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,940
know, there are some folks like them,

36
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:54,000
,

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
RE alongside um,

38
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,860
um,

39
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:33,220
and this is the

41
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
or in the workflow supposing it,

42
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,500
We use SUNY TEXT JAWS and we get a text

43
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,780
that the same template as T your

44
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,380
that the same template as OERкої message.

and OERoout

46
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,860
And now while I also want to discuss

47
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,800
the resolution for building a team

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,460
to build a team together with the Pearson team

49
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,260
we've done a lot across the board

50
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,360
lifting and building that real team

51
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,680
but it's a very good result

52
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,540
by saying I don't know

53
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,060

Uchitone for now.

58
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,620
We are the only our country that can perform

59
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,960
but there is not many that can actually perform.

60
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,260
But the only solution to this country

61
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,420
is to do everything we can to make people expensive.

62
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,920
So that is all a country we can build

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,460
wants to do andカンホーT

64
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,640

but to a cannedó

66
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,180
So we hope that this system will help

67
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,240
and it loves people of many countries.

68
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,320
how do you�

69
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,220
Sound very creative

70
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,480
and yet here I am

71
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,580
just standing at Police Station

72
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:47,680

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680

74
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
when I know that

75
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,860
my wasn't controlled

76
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,620
.

77
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,620
unknown

78
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,620

79
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,620
available

80
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,180
negative

81
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,220
standards

82
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,220
about

83
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,080
We call a beaten king collectors.

84
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,760
But particularly there's some tentacles

85
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:24,120
in its rein the

86
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,160
logic of the evaluation.

87
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,160
So, the question is, did they not, you know, support the pandemic's actions,

88
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,160
and how is the pandemic different from the rest of the world?

89
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,160
So, it's a very, very, very different question.

90
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,160
So, I think the question is, did they not support the crisis,

91
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,160
the specific crisis, you know, the crisis in the world,

92
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,160
or the historical crisis, or the economic crisis, or the economic crisis?

93
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,160
So, I think the question is, did they not support the pandemic,

94
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,160
and how is the pandemic different from the rest of the world?

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,160
So, I think the question is, did they not support the crisis,

96
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,160
the specific crisis, or the economic crisis,

97
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,160
the specific crisis, or the economic crisis,

98
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,160
or the historical crisis, or the economic crisis,

99
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,160
and how is the pandemic different from the rest of the world?

100
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,160
So, I think the question is, did they not support the crisis,

101
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,160
the specific crisis, or the economic crisis,

102
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,160
the specific crisis, or the economic crisis,

103
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,160
the specific crisis, or the economic crisis,

104
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,160
and I will go back to the other point.

105
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,160
So, I think the question is, did they not support the crisis,

106
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,160
the specific crisis, or the economic crisis,

107
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,160
the specific crisis, or the economic crisis,

108
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,160
the specific crisis, or the economic crisis,

109
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:11,160
and how is the pandemic different from the rest of the world?

110
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:28,160
Solo.

111
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:44,520
because it makes you go outside and set up

112
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,480
But, we know there are a father anda daughter

113
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,680
And a mother anda baby

114
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,720
And they remember all the fun

115
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,820
And it is wonderful

116
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,020
You see the family

117
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,140
He hadwide fellowship

118
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,520
6 months and 6 months

119
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,800
And after seven months

120
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,520
He became one of the men

121
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,520
And he had ticket

122
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,640
And now he is taking the keys

123
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,320
from the driver

124
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,680
so he bought the keys

125
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,700
In a truck

126
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,240
He gave him nine times

127
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,760
And Now he is getting the keys

128
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,420
This ends when your

129
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,660
persons when they make these

130
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,580
decisions, they choose to

131
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,420
give the answers to this

132
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,980
decision, because the

133
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,980
questions you make, very

134
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,020
many situations, there may

135
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,360
be situations people have

136
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,500
But the other dropped and it was released in July slam.

137
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,540
So what is happening is behind the scenes we can see real

138
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,940
events, there is SmackDown right now, there is SmackDown

139
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,700
out there, it's been blade running but they are not

140
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,840
back in final pieces but for now I am sure they are

141
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,920
not playing around too much.

142
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,680
That it is a movement especially for the new deal

143
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,660
is they are nervous.

144
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,620
It's a big movement for now as we are in July

145
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,500
pass there is a feeling of surprise from them,

146
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,080
it's going to exactly be like sadness, the surprise

147
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,860
from the random guys is going to be unbelievable.

In that case, if you came up to this room,

and you couldn't get to the end of the path of your network,

I want to talk about this. So for that, in the case of that, please

184
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,480
if it was the case, just for the station, it probably needed to be used in the past

185
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:59,680
the

186
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,700
why did you come to the space and what does it mean?

187
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:18,480
Because likemund returning to their initial

188
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,280
center , has developed that

189
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,900
ontiler access , here.

190
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,100
I'm not just talking about the army,

191
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,780
I'm talking about the people who are going to be respired.

192
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,660
This is a big problem, but you want to see that

193
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,860
people are going to be fighting for their lives,

194
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,700
which is not common, nothing different.

195
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,020
But, well, what you see here,

196
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,540
it's the same people who are going to be respired,

197
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,620
so I'm not just talking about the army,

198
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,700
so I'm talking about the people who are still working,

199
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,860
so I'm not just talking about the people who are still working,

200
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,820
because they need to be at the age of 400 first,

201
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,220
so you can see different projects

202
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,740
and the different types of tools.

203
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,340
But, well, for the people who are going to be respired,

204
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,620
I'm not just talking about the army,

205
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,980
I'm talking about the people who are still working,

206
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,060
so I'm not just talking about the people who are still working,

207
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,340
but there's a different kind of army

208
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,700
that's going to be respired.

209
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,100
You're not just talking about the people who are still working,

210
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,760
So basically, it's something that can be necessarily

211
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,720
appreciated in good social and cognitive learning.

212
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,220
Obviously, she's especially thankful for herdaditudes.

213
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,480
The socialchem applicant she benefit from,

214
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,240
was not extremely bad.

215
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,040
It's kind of like a sales department.

216
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,580
I'd like to start why not.

217
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,760
These are the leader trait, the afterlife.

218
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,160
Again, there's something really important

219
00:13:42,160 --> 00:14:08,580
You see the

220
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,500
just though would be considered a shell,

221
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,340
because it would have more impact on the웠 to those who work hard or become

222
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,820
even more absolutely aggressive,

223
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,940
because surely they have a purpose airplanes

224
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,780
and we make them more Russians.

225
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,980
Yes.

226
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,540
But for that reason I want to understand

227
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,460
what stands out aboutmentioned.

228
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,900
Two generally was when,

229
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,260
first, you have the M04KJ

230

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,140

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,340
first of all,

241
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,340

they're in different brings

244

like dealing with, for example, absolutely almond eggs,

245
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:46,420
what am I talking about,

246
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,100
if you color a fish like this,

247
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,980
color your fish like, I don't know,

248
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,700
but it's just what is,

249
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,860
cuz it's so, and, and

250
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,220

And we can talk about things forever.

But the Bombshell or utilitarian Gibbons

266
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,180
these folks are not necessarily going to be affected by it.

267
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,020

I'm just going to enjoy protecting it.

275
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,300
So that's their civilization.

276
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,580
And they can't blame nobody for such solution

277
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,320
aslessly we should've one, and I think

278
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,780
we can resolve the limits at least one way,

279
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,960
and that's solution for me.

280
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:49,400
But in that

00:17:49,400 --> 00:18:00,300

In Chopin's opus Lesson 1, a fugitive participates in the

00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,140
And I think that's the biggest problem.

285
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,660
The situation that we're in is really

286
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,180
different from the situation that we're in.

287
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,060
That's the problem.

288
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,660
And I think that's the biggest problem.

And I think that's the biggest problem.

299
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,380
And I think that's the biggest problem.

300
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,440
And you just talked about the pros and cons

301
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,900
of bringing the consumption toium

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,400
when we do go use this for the open- wanted?

305
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,900
Yeah, so obviously as you said,

306
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,820
ultimately this slaves for particular reasons

316
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,180
But some might have a mind

317
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,300
to write and forward

318
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,860
like this, which is good.

I figured that we'd have the Sym görder這邊

325
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:54,060
So I'm here today to do

326
00:20:54,060 --> 00:21:14,540
The purpose of the

327
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,540
And so I think that the pieces that are in the middle

328
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,540
are very different from each other.

329
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:26,540
So I think that the most interesting piece is

330
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,540
the fact that I think that, you know,

331
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,540
there's a whole lot of pieces that are out there

332
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,540
that are very different from each other.

333
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,540
And I think that that's one of the things that I'm

334
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,540
really excited about is the black and white piece.

335
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,540
And the fact that I think that that's one of the things

336
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:47,540
that I'm really excited about is the fact that

337
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,540
there's a whole lot of pieces that are out there

338
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,540
that are very different from each other.

339
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:57,540
And so I think that the most interesting piece is

340
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,540
the fact that I think that that's one of the things that I'm really excited about.

341
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,540
So I think that's one of the things that I'm really excited about.

342
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,540
That is white and black.

343
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,540
That is white and black.

344
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,540
That is white and black.

345
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,540
Because white and black is the most interesting piece.

346
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,540
And the rest is black and white.

347
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,540
You know, the piece.

348
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,540
And I think that the most interesting piece is that

349
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,540
I think that this piece right here,

350
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,800
Normally how much time do I answer it?

351
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,520

473
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,420
a distinction across the Cebu,

474

and that the

475
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,680
difference between these state and

476
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,260
their political bias is obvious

477
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,460
and won't be Cau되 is not

00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,300
it's a good thing we call anybody

this is serving as enough time, we need to be able to make the necessary changes Там»,

485
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,040
the last address.

486
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,260
So to tell us about the sort of change in the timing, it is mentioned in the kilka important

487
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:26,780
that says, learn how to negotiate something immediately so it can change the process.

489
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,720
the great value of those powers by far, such as the one that I've set up here,

490
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,520
consists of those 215, 51, those 2,000, 2,000,

491
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:45,820
and I think that it's the same as expected, the 111, 51, B, E, R, and G.

492
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,320
So that's a case of the animal and the aspect of the age.
