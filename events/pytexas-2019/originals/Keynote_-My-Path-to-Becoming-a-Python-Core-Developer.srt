1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
So without further ado, I'd like to introduce Emily Morehouse.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,520
Emily is a Core Python contributor,

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,000
and she's going to have a great talk for us today.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,640
Let's give her a round of applause.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,140
Thank you.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:12,640
Thank you.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,640
All right, everyone, welcome to PyTexas.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,560
I'm really, really excited to be here.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,960
Sort of one of the interesting things about my Python regional

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,800
conference journey is that every other regional conference

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,160
that I have attended, it has rained,

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,800
which is a very lovely, lovely welcome to this city.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,680
But I live in Denver right now, but I grew up in Florida.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,800
So we see these really, really incredible thunderstorms.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,560
And so any time we do get rain, it always

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,760
kind of reminds me of home.

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,720
So all right.

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,760
So a little bit about me.

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,880
My name's Emily Morehouse.

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,320
I am the director of engineering at a company called

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,800
CuddleSoft.

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,360
We are a digital product development company.

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,240
So we make anything from web and mobile applications

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,640
to CI-CD pipelines and cloud architectures to embedded

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,920
systems and sort of everything in between.

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,720
I'm a Python Core developer, which, as you may have guessed,

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,760
is actually one of the reasons why I'm here today.

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,000
A couple of other things.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,560
I consider myself to be a polyglot.

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,840
I work with a lot of Python and JavaScript

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,160
and a lot of other languages.

32
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,080
If you are in the JavaScript world,

33
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,680
I help maintain a package called Axios, which

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,360
is basically like the requests of JavaScript.

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,440
I'm also a huge proponent of visual testing.

36
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,680
I really like screenshot testing.

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,000
I really love auto formatting, including black.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,680
And I am just, in general, a really, really huge language

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,040
nerd.

40
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,320
But aside from all of these things,

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,280
I really like playing video games, doing yoga,

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,680
going hiking.

43
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,440
And I also have a really cute dog.

44
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,200
So outside of all of these things

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,640
that you kind of see listed here as my pedigree,

46
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,600
I'm just like all the rest of you in this room.

47
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,840
So a little bit about why we're here.

48
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,120
I'm going to talk about my path to becoming a Core developer,

49
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,400
how I got here, a bunch of kind of lessons and things

50
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,560
that I observed along the way, and some other things

51
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,060
that you don't get to know about yet,

52
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,600
or else that would spoil the ending.

53
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,520
So I want to start at PyCon Montreal 2015.

54
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,280
And actually, to get a really good sense of why PyCon

55
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,600
Montreal 2015 was important to me,

56
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,960
I have to step back a little bit.

57
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,040
And so in 2014, I had finished my bachelor's

58
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,960
in computer science, along with a couple of other degrees

59
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,960
at Florida State University.

60
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,120
Because of some timing issues, I wound up

61
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,120
starting my graduate school program

62
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,040
at FSU, which was not necessarily what I had intended.

63
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,880
And so I was in a state where I didn't really

64
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,000
know what my next step was.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,760
I was being recruited by a lot of large companies.

66
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,600
I was thinking about transferring school

67
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,000
so that I could finally move out of Florida.

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,800
But I didn't really know what I should do.

69
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,280
And so a bunch of things sort of fell together.

70
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,920
And I actually wound up dropping out of grad school,

71
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,240
staying in Tallahassee for a few more years,

72
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,720
and starting a company with my boyfriend at the time,

73
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,680
now my husband.

74
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,640
And so getting to the point where

75
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,280
we were able to attend PyCon 2015

76
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,640
was really a validating experience for us.

77
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,440
Cuddlesoft had matured at that point

78
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,760
to where we could actually support us financially

79
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,320
going to this.

80
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,120
And it really made me feel like I was at least

81
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,080
taking a step in the right direction for what

82
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,960
my future was going to be.

83
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,120
In all of this, I did have some doubts.

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,200
I really, really loved programming languages.

85
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,000
I was working on building compilers and parsers

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,200
and doing some really cool research in that area.

87
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,520
And I was pretty unhappy that I was leaving all of that behind

88
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,120
because I didn't necessarily see where

89
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,960
that could fit into my future of building

90
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,960
a company like Cuddlesoft.

91
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,640
And so at PyCon Montreal 2015, Guida Van Russum,

92
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,880
our BFL emeritus, beloved creator of Python,

93
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,800
made an announcement.

94
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,720
And that was that he had made the observation

95
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,920
that there were no female core developers on the CPython team.

96
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,240
And so he had this sort of call to action to everyone

97
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,120
that by the following year at PyCon,

98
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,680
he wanted to have at least two female core

99
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,920
developers on the team.

100
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,880
And so I think Frank was sitting next to me at this point.

101
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,200
And he was just poking me.

102
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,360
And he's like, do it, do it.

103
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,680
This is exactly the thing that you felt

104
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,040
like you had been leaving behind.

105
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,960
And now you have a way to contribute and find that again

106
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,240
in this new path that you're taking.

107
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,560
And so I stopped the gift for you.

108
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,000
But at this point, I was able to meet Guido at a post-conference

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,800
event.

110
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,160
And it was in this very stereotypical, not Python

111
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,520
necessarily post-event.

112
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,960
So it was at this bar.

113
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,320
It was really dark.

114
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,480
And so Guido was there.

115
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,520
And Frank and another attendee that we had met

116
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,400
kind of encouraged me.

117
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,120
They were like, there's Guido over there.

118
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,520
You should totally go talk to him.

119
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,360
And I'm like, OK.

120
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,280
And so I kind of have to get up my nerves to go talk to him.

121
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,600
And I think that I just went over and word vomited and was

122
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
I really love Python.

123
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,480
I really love compilers.

124
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,000
And I want to do this thing.

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,360
And very, very shortly into this conversation,

126
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,520
we're maybe two minutes in.

127
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,920
And the other conference attendee

128
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,640
that we had recently met walks by

129
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,440
and takes a flash photograph of me talking to Guido

130
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,760
in this very dimly lit bar where it is very, very obvious.

131
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,800
And so I just immediately turned bright red.

132
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,680
I feel paparazzied.

133
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,440
I feel very embarrassed and very put on the spot

134
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,760
and have a lot of attention brought to us

135
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,600
that I really didn't need at that time.

136
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,520
And so I very quickly concluded the conversation.

137
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,360
And Guido was like, email me.

138
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,640
And we'll figure out next steps.

139
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,440
And I was like, yeah, OK.

140
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,920
And just backed up and just immediately started burrowing

141
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,800
directly into the ground.

142
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,440
And at this point, I didn't email him.

143
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,400
I didn't move forward.

144
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,640
I really sort of let this experience really sort of

145
00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:00,880
envelop what I had wanted to do moving forward for myself.

146
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,920
And so we get to PyCon Portland.

147
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,400
Keeping Portland weird in this picture.

148
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,720
We get to PyCon Portland.

149
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,200
And there are still zero female core developers

150
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,000
who have joined the team.

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,840
And so at this point, one of the things

152
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,720
that I really have grown to admire about Guido

153
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,920
is that everything about our Python community

154
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,880
really is top down.

155
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,680
And one of the things that Guido has always done

156
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,440
is if he recognizes that there is a problem or something

157
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,080
that he believes in, he is one of the first people

158
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,800
to step up and put in the work to make those things happen.

159
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,920
So what actually happened is that Guido

160
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,320
offered to personally mentor anyone

161
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,320
who is interested in becoming a core developer.

162
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,520
And so at this point, I had already

163
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,840
gone through about a year of this kind of feeling of regret

164
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,040
and this like, is somebody else going to step up and do this?

165
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,960
Me feeling like I had really sort of backed away

166
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,240
and painted myself into a corner where

167
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,840
the longer that I didn't take any sort of action

168
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,880
to move forward, the harder it was for me

169
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,120
to actually step forward again and say,

170
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,080
hey, remember we talked about this thing?

171
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,320
I do really want to do this.

172
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,880
And so at this point, I reached out to Guido and said,

173
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,880
hey, remember that really embarrassing time

174
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,000
we met in a bar and this guy took a flash photograph of us?

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,800
And I really had to make a joke out of it

176
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,080
to get myself mentally past the barriers

177
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,320
that I had set for myself.

178
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,840
And so honestly, I don't think Guido had even

179
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,760
thought twice about it.

180
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,840
And he was like, oh, yeah, I totally remember you.

181
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,280
Where have you been kind of thing.

182
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,800
And so at this point, I got to start meeting

183
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,440
with Guido every few weeks.

184
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:59,640
And so I started this process with Guido and mentorship.

185
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,440
And so one of the first things that they

186
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,960
tell new contributors to do is go read the contributing

187
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,800
guide, try to fix documentation, fix typos,

188
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,440
like learn the process of contributing,

189
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,760
find bugs and fix bugs, that sort of thing.

190
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,840
But to a certain extent, some of those things

191
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,160
didn't interest me.

192
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,480
I wasn't really drawn to contributing to CPython

193
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,960
to fix documentation.

194
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,200
And I started to try to fix bugs along the way.

195
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,680
But one of the really, really difficult things

196
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,440
about bugs in CPython is that they're fixed really quickly.

197
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Or CPython has been around for so long

198
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,520
that a lot of the low-hanging fruit and easier bugs to fix

199
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,200
are already kind of picked off and knocked down.

200
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,000
And so the things that are left are

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,360
these things that have a really, really high barrier

202
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,240
to entry for new contributors.

203
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,560
A really great one is Unicode, for example.

204
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,440
We've been fighting with Unicode for how long,

205
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,840
and we still are having issues with it.

206
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,600
It's not a great place for somebody

207
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,320
to be able to come in and feel any sort of validation,

208
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,880
because you can't really come in and make an impact very quickly.

209
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,760
And so I tried to take this experience and learn from it.

210
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,880
So what I started doing was, if I started on a bug fix

211
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,600
and somebody else wound up kind of beating me to it

212
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,960
and submitting a patch before I did,

213
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,880
I would try to go through and still finish my implementation

214
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,680
and go through and see what I could learn

215
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,840
from how my implementation maybe differed

216
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,680
from somebody who was a core developer submitting a bug fix

217
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,920
and really learn from that.

218
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,400
And so what that allowed me to do

219
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,440
was see different things about the CPython environment

220
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,760
that I wouldn't necessarily have known otherwise,

221
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,800
whether that was a helper function,

222
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,280
a different way of doing things, different impacts that

223
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,760
changes in one area of the code might have in another place,

224
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,040
ways to see these edge cases that I wasn't maybe

225
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,080
thinking about.

226
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,840
And so I tried to take that and turn it

227
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,240
into a really positive experience.

228
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,160
The thing was that still at the end of the day,

229
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,160
I didn't feel like I was really truly contributing anything.

230
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,560
I was just kind of learning on my own.

231
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,320
So I kind of ditched that very quickly

232
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,560
and started reading the source code.

233
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,640
And so I kind of made the decision

234
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,000
to go back to my roots of what I had been interested in.

235
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,720
And I started kind of stepping through the compiler

236
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,960
and the interpreter and the parser

237
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,160
and really figuring out how all of these CPython internals

238
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,480
worked under the hood just by putting

239
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,680
a bunch of print statements or debug statements in there

240
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,040
and just learning.

241
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,400
And so one of the interesting things about Guido's

242
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,120
mentorship was that I had never really

243
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,760
had any sort of technical mentorship in this way before.

244
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,520
And so what I expected coming in was Guido to say,

245
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,400
you know, here's this bug.

246
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,800
I've found this bug for you.

247
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,080
Go fix this bug and come back to me with your bug fix.

248
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,040
And that's really not how it went.

249
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,960
He came to me and said, how can I help?

250
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,240
What do you want to learn?

251
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,880
And really, really left the door open to me.

252
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,240
And I was like, oh, OK.

253
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,200
I have to drive this ship, but I don't

254
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,120
know what on earth I'm doing.

255
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,800
So at this point, Guido asked me a very, very kind, high level

256
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,120
question that wasn't really meant to guide me,

257
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,280
necessarily.

258
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,600
But he asked, what do you see yourself

259
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,560
doing with this process that you're going through?

260
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,080
And he warned me that a lot of the code and things

261
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,720
that I was working on didn't really change very often.

262
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,080
And he was like, there's not really anything

263
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,640
that you can go in and improve or change.

264
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,640
There's no bugs here.

265
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,280
And basically, I realized that what I was looking at

266
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,200
was 15-plus-year-old files that hadn't been

267
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,520
touched in that many years.

268
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,360
And so I was kind of like, well, this is fine.

269
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,480
I'm enjoying what I'm doing.

270
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,200
I feel like I'm learning a lot, so let's keep going.

271
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,120
And so not having any idea what on earth I was reading

272
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,840
turned into this process of reading and learning

273
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,880
and discovering and getting to find new things.

274
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,400
But still, on this journey, I would get really, really

275
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,520
introspective.

276
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,600
Because I felt like I came in and had this expectation

277
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,800
for myself of, I'm going to come in and I'm going to contribute

278
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,640
and I'm going to do really awesome things.

279
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,680
And that wasn't at all what I felt was happening.

280
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,360
So I would have these highs and lows of feeling

281
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,440
like I'm doing something really cool,

282
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,720
but then I don't feel like I'm doing anything at all.

283
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,560
And wondering if I had made the right decision.

284
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,680
Should I have just listened to the guidelines that

285
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,400
had been set out?

286
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,680
And should I have just been fixing documentation?

287
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,640
And was I trying to do too much as a new contributor?

288
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,280
And maybe at the end of the day, I

289
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,360
was worried that I just wasn't cut out for that type of work.

290
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,160
And so throughout this process, one of the things

291
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,280
that I am very gracious that I was able to learn

292
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,640
is that there is a lot of unwritten history, especially

293
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,400
with projects that are as old as CPython's implementation.

294
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,720
So much unwritten history that doesn't get communicated

295
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,880
to contributors or the general audience of the project.

296
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,520
And so one of the things that I would really enjoy

297
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,400
is that I would come across something

298
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,840
in my sort of meandering discoveries,

299
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,000
and I would find something confusing

300
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,560
or not really understand it, and I would ask Weedo about it,

301
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,880
and he would say, oh, no, that's interesting.

302
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,960
And I would find these very innocuous pieces of the code

303
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,600
that wound up having a really, really interesting backstory

304
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,920
as to why they came to be that way.

305
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,240
And there was no other way that I would have known or learned

306
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,080
about these things if it hadn't been finding it

307
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,080
and asking Weedo about it and getting a chance

308
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,440
to actually interact with the people who had shaped

309
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,440
and written that code in the very beginning.

310
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,440
And so I learned that having a respect

311
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,680
for the history of a project is really, really important.

312
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,640
So especially with something like CPython,

313
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,400
it would be really awesome to have

314
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,880
something like CPython, it would be really awesome

315
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,960
to come in and rip a bunch of things out and do it better

316
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,640
and do it in a more modern way.

317
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,960
But if you don't have that respect for why

318
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,760
it is the way it is, you're going to come in

319
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,040
and you're going to break things,

320
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,120
and you're going to wind up taking something

321
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,600
in a very wrong direction.

322
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,760
And so this whole process for me went on

323
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,840
for about a year and a half.

324
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,000
And during these times, I was really worried

325
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,200
that he would cut me off, that he would be like,

326
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,560
hey, yeah, so it's been like a year and a half.

327
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,400
I'm not really totally sure what you're doing.

328
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,800
I don't know if you really know what you're doing yet.

329
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,880
So I was just very worried he was going to sort of

330
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,400
reclaim his time back from me.

331
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,920
And don't get me wrong, I had absolutely

332
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,840
zero reason to think any of this.

333
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,560
It was all in my head.

334
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,640
Weedo had never given me any sort of reason to doubt myself

335
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,120
or to doubt his support of what I wanted to do.

336
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,680
But there was still this like inkling

337
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,040
in the back of my head that something

338
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,480
that I wasn't doing enough.

339
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,600
And so in that time, we also got our first

340
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,160
two female core developers.

341
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,240
Marietta Ujaya and Carol Willing were both

342
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,200
promoted to core developers, which was a really,

343
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,160
really monumental step for CPython.

344
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,080
So we fast-forward to PyCon Cleveland 2018.

345
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,080
And so this was actually the second year

346
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,400
that I was able to attend the Language Summit.

347
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,360
I attended in 2017 and really didn't interact

348
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,640
with a lot of people, just kind of like snuck in the back,

349
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,640
listened and soaked up everything

350
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,840
that everybody was talking about

351
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,280
and then just like crept right back out.

352
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,400
If you might have guessed, I'm an introvert.

353
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,200
Just throwing that out there.

354
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,480
And so the second Language Summit,

355
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,440
I was feeling a little bit better.

356
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,240
I felt like I was really keeping up to date

357
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,360
with some of the major happenings in CPython.

358
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,800
So I really kind of forced myself out of my shell

359
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,880
to talk to other core developers at the Language Summit.

360
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,720
And so there were a couple of really monumental things

361
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,360
that happened around the time of PyCon 2018.

362
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,560
And one of them was that PEP572 was accepted.

363
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,640
So if you don't know what PEP572 is,

364
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,080
it is assignment expressions.

365
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,120
It is one of the most recent changes to Python syntax.

366
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,600
These things don't really roll around very often.

367
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,240
But that was accepted.

368
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,560
And right around that same time, Guido stepped down as VDFL.

369
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,040
And so at this point, I wasn't really sure

370
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,400
what the path forward for CPython was.

371
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,880
I wasn't sure what my mentorship relationship

372
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,680
with Guido was going to happen.

373
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,960
But at that point, he reassured me.

374
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,240
He was like, no, yes, I stepped down,

375
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,120
but I am still going to mentor you.

376
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,000
And actually, I wanted to see

377
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,400
if you wanted to implement PEP572.

378
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,800
And so at this point, it was really this moment

379
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,160
of everything coming together.

380
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,160
All of the areas that I had spent so much time meandering

381
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,120
and learning and not really being able

382
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,080
to do anything with it, all of that came together

383
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,080
for this really, really lucky situation

384
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,240
where I was the perfect person to move forward

385
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,520
and implement that because I had been researching

386
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,600
and learning so much about it.

387
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,760
And so he basically said, I know that this is going

388
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,240
to be really, really tricky.

389
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,240
As they wrote the PEP for this, they were like,

390
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,200
well, we don't really know how this is gonna work,

391
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,640
but we'll figure it out.

392
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,120
And so he said, it's gonna be really tricky,

393
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,360
but I'll be here to help you if you get stuck.

394
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,920
And so this is where I got into some of my favorite moments

395
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,880
because this is where any of those doubts and uncertainties

396
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,320
that I had had, had evaporated.

397
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,120
And so I got to sit and, so this is a photo

398
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,880
of the whiteboard conference desk

399
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,240
in one of our old office spaces.

400
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,120
And I would just sit there and figure out,

401
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,000
how am I gonna do this, how does this work?

402
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,200
And really just got to dive head first

403
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,860
into figuring all of this out.

404
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,940
And so I was actually able to get my 90% implementation

405
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,260
completed within the first couple of months.

406
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,420
And at that point, I was very, very graciously invited

407
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,620
to attend the Python Core Developer Sprints,

408
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,540
which was sort of a rarity.

409
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,540
Typically, that's only reserved for core developers,

410
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,740
for them to kind of get together and work on implementations,

411
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,860
talk through details together.

412
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,560
And I was very, very grateful

413
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,860
that I was invited to attend this.

414
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,580
And so at this point, I got to kind of see

415
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,260
all these people again that had turned into friends

416
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,300
and colleagues from attending the Language Summit.

417
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,120
And I also got to sit and work through all of the like

418
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,740
really, really hairy implementation details

419
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,300
of scoping for assignment expressions

420
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,440
with Guido in person at the sprint.

421
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,300
So one of the things that I had to remind myself was that

422
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,420
my path didn't wind up being the one

423
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,620
that I expected myself to have.

424
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,760
I realized that I had to give myself time.

425
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,140
And honestly, you can look at this timeline

426
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,480
and sure it took three and a half years

427
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,300
from that initial inception

428
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,380
for me to actually become a core developer,

429
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,740
but there's a whole lot of other really, really small ticks

430
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,740
on this timeline that happened along the way

431
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,980
to get me where I am.

432
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,220
And so I had to give myself time and give myself the space

433
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,420
to let the process happen as it needed to

434
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,880
and not how I wanted it to.

435
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,460
And so one of the other really important factors

436
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,060
when promoting somebody to becoming a core developer

437
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,780
is trust.

438
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,220
We have to have trust that they will kind of uphold

439
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,660
the CPython name, that they will be good community members

440
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,260
and kind to other people, whether they are core developers

441
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,300
or first time contributors.

442
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,780
We have to trust that they won't merge in PRs haphazardly

443
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,620
and that they will take care in the code

444
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,500
that they're crafting and the code that they're merging in

445
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,060
from other people.

446
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,300
And that's something that you can't really measure

447
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,440
in the number of commits.

448
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,500
You can't look at someone and say,

449
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,740
oh, well they have 30 commits and 30 PRs to CPython

450
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,620
and therefore they deserve to be a core developer.

451
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,260
There's so much more that goes into that

452
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,220
and being able to interact with people

453
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,060
and establish that trust in an online distributed environment

454
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,980
is something that is really, really tricky

455
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,620
and at the end of the day really does just take time.

456
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,300
And so I wanna talk a little bit about

457
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
internal versus external motivations.

458
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,380
And so a lot of people come to me and they're like,

459
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,860
oh, you're a core developer, that's so cool.

460
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,580
Well, I mean, yeah, but it's also like a lot

461
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,660
of really hard work and a lot of tedious work

462
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,460
at the end of the day too.

463
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,020
So keeping up with the bug tracker,

464
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,300
giving beneficial feedback.

465
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,460
It's all things that are not necessarily

466
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,020
always very fun or very glamorous,

467
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,260
but it's things that all core developers have to do.

468
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,140
And so if you go into something seeking

469
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,740
some sort of public recognition

470
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,980
or if you are the kind of person that decides like,

471
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,220
oh, one day I want to be a director of engineering

472
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,180
or I wanna be a CEO or I wanna make a certain salary,

473
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,820
I would really encourage you to kind of look

474
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,620
inside of yourself and try to figure out

475
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,300
why you want to do those things.

476
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,580
Because if you're looking for external accolades,

477
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,380
the longevity of your motivation is not going to be there.

478
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,980
Whereas if you find something

479
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,580
that you're really truly passionate about

480
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,140
as an internal motivation,

481
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,900
you will continue working towards that thing

482
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,260
for years and years to come.

483
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,940
Okay, so I really love this GIF of Alison Brie.

484
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,740
So one of the things that I also had to kind of

485
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,180
really like solidify myself was that you don't have

486
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,100
to be the badass all the time.

487
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,540
You don't have to be the person that comes in

488
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,740
and always has the great ideas or the best implementation

489
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,500
or the most elegant code.

490
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,300
And so these things really take time and process.

491
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,540
And if you try to kind of walk in there

492
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,780
and be this really awesome person,

493
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,500
I don't think that you're being very true to yourself

494
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,380
and I don't think that you are taking care

495
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,020
to build your team and your colleagues up around you.

496
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,020
And so I wanted to be very clear that it is very, very okay

497
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,340
and it is very, very human to be the person

498
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:33,060
that has doubts and insecurities and uncertainties

499
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,620
and that you're okay to have moments

500
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,060
where you don't know what your path is

501
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,100
or what your next step is or how to solve that problem

502
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,740
and that all of those things are very, very normal

503
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,900
and very, very okay.

504
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,620
And so this leads me into imposter syndrome.

505
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,780
And I think that that is a lot of what I was going through

506
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,460
and probably what a lot of people go through,

507
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,860
whether they put this sort of name on it or not.

508
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,900
And so imposter syndrome can be really, really crippling.

509
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,180
And I think that a lot of that probably played

510
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,660
into that first year where I had met Mido

511
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,140
and then stepped back and was too scared

512
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,980
to kind of take that next step.

513
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,900
And I think that having an excuse for,

514
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,740
oh, well, this embarrassing thing happened

515
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,500
and so therefore I'm not gonna reach out to Mido again,

516
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,780
really got in the way and also really fed

517
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,660
into allowing myself to feel a lot of imposter syndrome.

518
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,740
And one of the things that I also think is important

519
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,940
is that there are a lot of pieces of our communities

520
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,780
that play into imposter syndrome.

521
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,740
I'm gonna show you a couple of tweets in a second

522
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,100
that I think really illustrate this.

523
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,740
But even after our tech communities are fixed,

524
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,340
we're still gonna be talking about imposter syndrome.

525
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,700
And so this is a really great tweet.

526
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,740
It says, imposter syndrome will have you questioning

527
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,540
your place in the spaces that you prayed about being in.

528
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,220
And so this really kind of spoke to me

529
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,740
because you can put in so much work

530
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,780
to get to somewhere that you really, really want to be

531
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,340
and you can still have this little like demon

532
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,580
in the back of your head telling you

533
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,700
that even though you put in a bunch of work

534
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,980
and that other people think that what you're doing

535
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,980
is beneficial and great,

536
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,260
you can still feel these insecurities

537
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,900
even though you've worked so hard.

538
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,020
And so this one's a little bit more relevant

539
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,380
for happenings that have been going on in the last few days

540
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,140
with the really, really awesome depiction of a black hole

541
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,180
that we were able to see.

542
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:47,180
And so I think that reframing imposter syndrome a bit

543
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,220
in terms of how our communities impact

544
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,500
our own personal feelings is really important.

545
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,500
Being able to separate the two is important.

546
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,100
So if I'm getting a bunch of external feedback

547
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,780
telling me that I'm not necessarily worthy

548
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,860
does not mean that you should listen to those people.

549
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,540
And so I think that for most of us in this room,

550
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,460
we're really, really lucky

551
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,220
because Python has an absolutely incredible community.

552
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,780
But in a lot of other tech communities,

553
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,020
these things aren't necessarily as guaranteed,

554
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,060
especially for women and minorities

555
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,500
who are part of those groups.

556
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,620
And so I've heard throughout my journey

557
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,700
from a lot of different people

558
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,220
who are either first time contributors to see Python

559
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,820
or who have been contributing to see Python

560
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,260
for five to 10 years.

561
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,300
And they all have expressed feelings of doubt

562
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,260
and feelings of imposter syndrome.

563
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,220
And even the people who,

564
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,460
I think that it's expected when somebody is new

565
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,060
that they feel imposter syndrome,

566
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,140
but it's less expected that once somebody reaches

567
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,820
a certain level of success or acclaim,

568
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,900
that they no longer feel these things.

569
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,900
And so I've really been grateful for the people

570
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,060
who have been at it for a long time

571
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,900
and who are still really willing to open up and say,

572
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,340
yeah, I've been trying to work on this problem

573
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,100
for the last six months

574
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,180
and I don't feel like I'm getting anywhere.

575
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,620
And I've been working on this for five years

576
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,580
and I still don't really feel like I know what I'm doing.

577
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,620
Because at the end of the day,

578
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:29,380
if you don't feel that sort of uncertainty

579
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,180
or doubt moving forward,

580
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,900
you probably aren't doing something

581
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,140
that's really, truly challenging yourself.

582
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,460
And so I wanted to bring this up.

583
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,220
There's a lot of different versions of this image

584
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,020
circulating on the internet,

585
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,140
but I think that everyone needs to hear this again.

586
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,020
And that's that the things that I know

587
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,860
are not a subset of what I think everybody else knows.

588
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,660
And that really, at the end of the day,

589
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,460
I don't know anything more than you do,

590
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,500
I just know different things than you do.

591
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,380
I'm gonna grow up somewhere.

592
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,980
And so throughout all of this,

593
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,860
one of the things that really kind of stood true to me

594
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,660
was that the fear of regret has to be greater

595
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,900
than the fear of failure.

596
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,900
And so even though we might be placed in these situations

597
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,300
where we have really, really high stakes

598
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,500
and there's something that we really, really wanna do

599
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,020
and we don't know if we can do it

600
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,020
or we don't know if we'll have the support for it, et cetera,

601
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:41,100
the fear of failure has to outweigh the fear of regret.

602
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,100
And so this really ties back

603
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,380
to these internal motivations that we have.

604
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,700
And you have to be really, really passionate about something

605
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,020
to be willing to put yourself out there and take that risk

606
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,780
and especially to be willing to fail publicly.

607
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,180
So I kinda wanna go back and wrap this up a little bit.

608
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,660
And I wanna talk a little bit about why it was so important

609
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:13,300
that people like Mariana, Carol, myself, and our other,

610
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,860
we now have five female core developers.

611
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,980
And so I wanted to talk a little bit

612
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,640
about why diversity matters.

613
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,780
And so I wanna show you a couple of pictures.

614
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,660
So this is from the PyCon Language Summit 2017.

615
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,800
I don't know how well you all can see it from your seats,

616
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,620
but basically what you can see here is

617
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,740
there's myself, Carol, and Mariana in this photo,

618
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,740
and everyone else in the picture is male.

619
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,900
And this is again from the PyCon Language Summit 2018.

620
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,260
And again, Carol, Mariana, and myself,

621
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,560
and everyone else is male.

622
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,940
So when I started contributing to CPython,

623
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,840
there was literally not anyone else who looked like me

624
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,620
who was a CPython core developer.

625
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,140
And the thing is is that role models who look like us

626
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,220
are really important.

627
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,420
I'm not gonna go down that path

628
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,700
of trying to convince you why diversity matters,

629
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,400
but there have been a lot of different studies

630
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,020
on why diversity matters and why having role models

631
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,420
who look like us matters,

632
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,620
whether that is a Barbie doll

633
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,740
that has the same skin color as you do,

634
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,600
or somebody that you can identify with,

635
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,840
whether on like a gender or race level.

636
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,360
And there's studies that have been done

637
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,560
that say that students who have teachers

638
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,320
who look like them in different ways

639
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,400
actually wind up feeling a lot more cared for,

640
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,480
are a lot more interested in their schoolwork,

641
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,820
and ultimately perform a lot better at the end of the day.

642
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,480
And so today we have approximately 100 core developers.

643
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,080
I think we're just under that number at this point.

644
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,080
And actually this is an older slide,

645
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,040
five female core developers today.

646
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,960
And so you can kind of see that that ratio

647
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,220
is still pretty sad.

648
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,360
And the other thing that happened is that

649
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,960
a lot of people, not a lot of people,

650
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,000
but a couple of people came forward and said,

651
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,520
oh well she was promoted because she was female,

652
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,600
or why would you want to bring somebody

653
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,520
into the core development team

654
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,180
just because they're female?

655
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,560
And so one of the things that started happening

656
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,960
is that the successes and the work

657
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,960
that we had all put forward was then sort of denigrated

658
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,760
by these people who decided to doubt us,

659
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,720
or try to attribute our successes to our genders.

660
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,720
And so I have to point out that increasing diversity

661
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,820
is not equal to lowering the bar.

662
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,320
And that just because I had a lot of doors

663
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,000
opened up for me because I was female,

664
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
whether that was mentorship, whether that was sponsorship,

665
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,720
whether that was just somebody else

666
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,220
who was a little bit more willing to listen to my voice

667
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,440
because I was different.

668
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,280
But all of these things at the end of the day

669
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,200
really can only make us better,

670
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,080
and can only help our communities grow

671
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,680
in the ways that we want them to.

672
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,640
And so through this process,

673
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,760
I've really had a chance to kind of look back

674
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,560
on my journey over the last four years.

675
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,000
And I really recognize how much community

676
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,080
has played into that.

677
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,800
And a lot of that is specifically

678
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,040
how incredible our Python community is,

679
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,960
and how devoted to diversity all of us are.

680
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,880
And so the thing is is that if I hadn't met Guido,

681
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,280
like if I hadn't happened to be in the same event

682
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,120
that he had been at,

683
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,720
or if I hadn't had the guts to send that email,

684
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,720
or hadn't let myself fall prey to my imposter syndrome

685
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,360
and given up,

686
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,680
if all of these things hadn't happened

687
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
in the way that they did,

688
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,000
I wouldn't have made it here today.

689
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,200
And I also got to really witness a lot of other people

690
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,640
going through the same process

691
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,760
that I didn't know they were going through.

692
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,640
And so I think moving forward,

693
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,760
what my sort of call to action is for all of you

694
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,960
is to be more open with each other.

695
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,920
Especially if you're somebody

696
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,000
who is in a position of leadership,

697
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,600
or is running a team,

698
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,200
I really, really encourage you

699
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,280
to say, I don't know, a lot more often,

700
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,400
and to really encourage everyone

701
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,920
to work together to find a solution

702
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,840
and foster that community

703
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,680
and those relationships with people.

704
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,200
I also think that it's really important

705
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,160
to tell other people when you're feeling doubtful,

706
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,800
or you're saying, man, I don't know,

707
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,520
I just don't know if I'm doing a great job today,

708
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,400
what do you think?

709
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,840
And really sort of open the door

710
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,080
to that sort of feedback

711
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,680
that you can get from other people.

712
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,160
And that sort of support,

713
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,480
because if you come in one day

714
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
and you're feeling bad

715
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,640
because you pushed something into production

716
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,600
and broke something or whatnot,

717
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,720
if you don't open up to people

718
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,240
and tell them how you're feeling,

719
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,520
you're never gonna wind up

720
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,360
getting the support that you need,

721
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,920
and you're never going to grow your team

722
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,400
to be a very empathetic, understanding group of people.

723
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,280
And so by supporting each other

724
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,800
through all these sort of highs and lows,

725
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,600
by making the decision

726
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,360
to make conscious choices

727
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,200
with how we interact with each other,

728
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,920
I know that at the end of the day

729
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,760
that we will always go further

730
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,960
when we have each other.

731
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,920
Thank you.

732
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,800
Applause
