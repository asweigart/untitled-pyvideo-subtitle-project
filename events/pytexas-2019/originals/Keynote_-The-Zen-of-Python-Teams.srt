1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey everyone, thank you so much. It is such an honor to be here.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
All right, here is my flashy thank you slide. This is the busiest slide you will see this morning.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It is unattractive on purpose. It just expresses my exuberance for being here.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And I always like to start with a thank you. It's really an honor to be here in this beautiful venue,

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
in this beautiful city, full of some of my favorite birds in the whole world.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Great-tailed grackles, aka zenate. They have a beautiful story. If you haven't read their story, it's amazing.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
They stole the songs. That's why they sound so weird, maybe.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Thank you to the volunteers, to the organizers, to the sponsors, and to all of you for coming out this morning to listen to me speak.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I want to talk to you about the Zen of Python teams.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 guiding principles that influence and guide the development of the language.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The lines are short and open to interpretation, and typically they're taken as direction on how we should write our code.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But they also have plenty to teach us about how we organize ourselves as humans.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
My argument is that not only has the Zen of Python influenced the design of our language,

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
but that it's shaped and continues to influence the way we build our teams.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Over the years, we've built a culture around these lines, a culture that extends beyond code into the way we live and work together.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The Zen has implicitly guided us in a hugely positive direction.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'd like to get explicit about its influence so we can be more purposeful about how we want to grow and change.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So my goal today is to reflect on some of the sayings and offer you a fresh interpretation of the Zen of Python, but for teams.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I believe it has plenty to tell us about communication and conflict, building inclusive teams and transparent processes, and promoting psychological safety.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And today, I want to teach you about some attitudes and processes and practices that can help you grow and be part of happier teams who deliver better software faster.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So to illustrate these attitudes, practices and processes, I'm going to be sharing stories from my work.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So I hope it's okay if I tell you a little bit about myself before I get started.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I work as director of engineering at Juice Analytics, leading operations and our platform team.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We use Python and Django to build what is basically Squarespace for data stories.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you or your company has some interesting data that you want to share, our platform helps you tell an interactive story that your users can walk through and answer interesting questions in a really delightful way.

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And here we are hanging up our new sign in our new natural office a few weeks ago.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We are definitely a hands-on group.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So Python has been a big part of my life for the most of the last decade, really.

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I've been an individual contributor on Python teams and open source projects, an organizer of Django Girls.

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Here's a picture from our Atlanta event, an organizer of Python meetups, including PyATL, which is one of the larger ones, and a director at Django.

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So my stories come from my work as an individual contributor on these Python teams, a volunteer on open source projects, and most recently as director of engineering, leading and managing my Python team.

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So no matter where I've been or what I've been working on, I've always valued working on a healthy team.

33
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So now as an engineering manager, I ask myself pretty much daily, how can I create a better experience for the people on this team?

34
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How can I help them feel more connected or empowered or successful?

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What actions can I take to encourage that?

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:31,000
In this case, it meant buying and bedazzling hats and buying themed accessories for my colleagues to wear because we separated into teams and I wanted everyone to have a nerdy theme, of course.

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So this talk is about the actions we can take, inspired by this in a Python, to improve our teams.

38
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
As you hear me share my team's stories, I hope you'll compare it against your own experience.

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Think about the way the Zen has shaped you and your teams. Which of the sayings stick with you? Do any of them confuse you?

40
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
When you leave PyTexas and you go back to your team, what will you bring with you?

41
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So here's our roadmap for today. First, I'm going to introduce you to the Zen. Maybe you've never seen it. Maybe it's been a while, so let's take a look at the text.

42
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Second, we're going to go step by step through six of the lines and interpret them for teams.

43
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'll often start by giving an interpretation as it relates to code, but mostly I'm going to focus on reading it in new and applying it to teams.

44
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And third and finally, we're going to wrap up with a call to action to take your reflections back to your team.

45
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's fun, it's interactive, it's my own little Easter egg that I'm excited to share with you, so stay tuned.

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So let's take a look at the Zen.

47
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Here's where it all began. The Zen of Python got started like so many great ideas on a mailing list.

48
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
As you probably can't read from your seat, the author playfully offered up 19 lines as an outline that Guido could start from.

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That was Tim Peters. The Zen of Python is technically 20 lines, but the final one's left blank for Guido to fill in.

50
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But you can't actually see that, can you? Okay, here you go, a little closer.

51
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I really like how Tim used the words outline and start from.

52
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
From the beginning, he emphasized how this is not complete. It's a work in progress.

53
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
By its very nature and from the very beginning, it's an invitation to interpretation.

54
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So we should feel really good coming up with our own interpretations today. It's in the spirit.

55
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And the spirit is joyful and playful. Let's read the lines.

56
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I won't read these aloud, but just take a moment to skim them, and don't worry if you can't make it all out.

57
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So the Zen of Python came to us from the humble beginnings on a mailing list to be incorporated as a pep to being printed on the back of our PyCon shirt two years ago.

58
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's seemingly everywhere and also right here with you. It's baked into your interpreter as an Easter egg.

59
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
If you're running Python and you run import this, you can read the Zen of Python.

60
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So now that we've looked at the Zen, let's step through six of the lines and interpret them for teams.

61
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So again, we're going to take a look at the lines. I'm going to read it, focus on an interpretation for teams.

62
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So let's get started at the beginning with beautiful is better than ugly.

63
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Hard stuff right off the bat. This one's challenging because words like beautiful and ugly can be tricky because we implicitly understand how subjective and contextual they are.

64
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They require context to make meaning, and even then we can still argue about it, right?

65
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Like one person's clean code is another person's cave painting, and some people think that clean code isn't even a thing, and we should stop saying that phrase.

66
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
When I was little, the word ugly didn't just mean aesthetically displeasing.

67
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It was actually used to describe behavior, as in ugly behavior, as in acting ugly.

68
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Acting ugly meant misbehaving, but a special kind of misbehaving usually related to being disrespectful, particularly of adults.

69
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You need a little context of parents and kids potentially in the southern U.S. to wrap your head around the idea of acting ugly.

70
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But if you'll grant me this idea that we can act ugly, we can ask, what kind of behavior is ugly on teams?

71
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What have you personally seen done on your teams that's put your group two steps back?

72
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
How about information hoarding? I think that's an ugly behavior.

73
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It defeats the purpose of collaboration and growing together when someone knows something helpful that they could share when they purposely don't share it.

74
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What about bitter or cutting code reviews? Your goal should be to critique code, not people.

75
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Or how about if somebody wants to contribute to your project, but there's no information about how to get started?

76
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
There's no read me, there's no docs, there's no one to ask for help.

77
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's break this down a little bit more.

78
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
To help interpret the lines for teams, I want to introduce you to Ron Western's typology of organizational cultures.

79
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He wrote a paper in 1988 where he identified three types of leadership that bring about different types of culture and team communication.

80
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Those are pathological, bureaucratic, and generative.

81
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Your team's type is going to be reflected in its leadership, the way it approaches problems and conflict, and the way communication flows or does not flow in your organization.

82
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:27,000
On pathological teams, information is viewed as a personal resource to be used in political power struggles.

83
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
They're characterized by large amounts of fear and threat.

84
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
People often hoard information or withhold it for political reasons or distort it to make themselves look better.

85
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Sounds pretty ugly to me.

86
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
On bureaucratic teams, alignment with one's own unit or function takes place of alignment with the mission.

87
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
They protect departments.

88
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
There's an idea that they want to maintain their turf.

89
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
They insist on their own rules.

90
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
They want things to be done by their book.

91
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Sounds kind of imperious, kind of authoritarian.

92
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
When you're working on teams, that's not a good look.

93
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Some would call it ugly.

94
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:19,000
On generative teams, in contrast, the leader emphasizes that the most important goal to accomplish is the mission, and they work on rallying people around that mission.

95
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
They ask, how can we accomplish our goal?

96
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Those groups tend to be higher in cooperation.

97
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,000
People feel like they can take risks because they feel like the risks will be shared and they won't be scapegoated.

98
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And failure leads to inquiry, not scapegoating or blaming or root cause analysis.

99
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Information flows freely.

100
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Hey, I think we found something beautiful.

101
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So behaviors on pathological and bureaucratic teams hold your team back and they're ugly.

102
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But if you can get it right, if you can build a generative team, you'll be rewarded with a happier team that will deliver better software faster.

103
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's beautiful.

104
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So ask yourself, what type of team do you want to be on?

105
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We could debate beautiful code all day.

106
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Thankfully, beautiful behavior is a little more clear.

107
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Next up, explicit is better than implicit.

108
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It makes me think of how important documentation is.

109
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Is Mason here?

110
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Did anyone see his amazing talk yesterday?

111
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yes, it was so good.

112
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Mason, he is the undisputed Docs Evangelist of Pi Texas this year.

113
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And I'm going to give him some more reasons to preach the gospel in this section.

114
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Healthy teams document their processes and expectations and how tos.

115
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
They provide playbooks and resources and onboarding guides and tutorials.

116
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
They make it clear how to contribute, what steps to take and what to do when you're confused.

117
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
They do this because documenting your processes makes it easier for others to join you.

118
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Now, without good docs, as I think Mason alluded to yesterday, people who already know each other can mostly muddle through.

119
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's because they're cheating and they're leaning on the existing relationships they already have to get unblocked and get their questions answered.

120
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But what if you're a new person? You don't have that shared context.

121
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You don't know the back channels.

122
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So we need to document our processes in order to make it more accessible to people who don't look like us or don't already know us.

123
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Along with public docs, it's important to keep conversation in the open.

124
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Another way to lower the barrier to injury.

125
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If you use Slack or something similar, this means keeping your conversation about your work in the main channels, not in DMs or other obscure places.

126
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Keeping the conversation in the open makes it easier, as we see here, for anyone to learn from it or to jump in and help if somebody has questions.

127
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And while Slack is not documentation, keeping your chats in the open does create that public record that is somewhat searchable, depending on how you feel about Slack's search feature.

128
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Documenting your processes also improves relationships between teams.

129
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
This is some of my team, my boss, one of my leads, one of my other leads.

130
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Healthy teams head off conflict by setting ground rules about how they communicate with other teams.

131
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
On our team, one of our values is consistency of process.

132
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We have several types of SLAs or service level agreements with our customers, both internal and external,

133
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
where we have to be crystal clear about how work will get done and on what timeline and who's going to work it.

134
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Before we wrote these SLAs, our inner team relationships were pretty strained.

135
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But once we took the time to document our processes and expectations, we found we had way less conflict and more mutual understanding of what it was going to take to get the work done.

136
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So that meant fewer fire drills, fewer late night requests, fewer people working on the weekend and starting to feel bitter about that.

137
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
We also document our people.

138
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Recently, I put a call out on Twitter to ask about y'all's favorite lines, and I really love this response from Lee.

139
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Lee is referring to code here.

140
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But we can do this with people too.

141
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
On my team, I led us in an activity where we created individual profiles to share amongst our team.

142
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The profiles answer some of the following questions.

143
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And I ask that my folks refer to these pretty periodically, especially before working closely with an individual,

144
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
because the doc can remind us how our colleagues know they will feel successful and what might cause them to stumble.

145
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It was a fun activity.

146
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm going to be giving a whole talk on the process that led to these documents at Lead Dev New York in a couple of weeks.

147
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So watch that talk or chat with me if you want to know more about that process.

148
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's more involved than this slide, but trace.

149
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So the next one, simple is better than complex.

150
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We build complicated features and solve complex requirements with sets of smaller, more straightforward features, right?

151
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's how we do it.

152
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
We build meaningful relationships and work through tough issues by building a foundation of smaller interactions

153
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
that build emotional bank account or trust with each other.

154
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So make sure you're taking the time to have coffee with your colleague or catch up on the weekend or ask questions about each other.

155
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Show you care personally.

156
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You don't have to be a manager to do that.

157
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You spend most of your days with these people.

158
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
On our team, we're mostly remote, so we do something called Remote Happy Hour.

159
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Every week we meet for an hour just to talk about our lives.

160
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
We just grab a beverage and chat.

161
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And I think for some people it might feel tempting to skip a meeting like this because you don't really see the immediate value.

162
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But this kind of thing is what helps you make a deposit in the emotional bank account that you're building with your colleagues.

163
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You're building that trust and that familiarity and that shared language and those good feelings that you can lean on when things get tough.

164
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And sometimes your colleague with a pug puts on a pug mask and you get to laugh a lot because he totally confuses his pug.

165
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It was pretty great.

166
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah, Casey. Casey rules.

167
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So it's important to make this time a priority because it's not always pug masks and giggles, right?

168
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Like, we're going to have to make some withdrawals from this bank account, so let's make sure it's healthy.

169
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Deadlines and stress and team conflict is going to take its toll.

170
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Someone's going to frustrate you. They're going to annoy you.

171
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And so our relationships with each other are the most complex and complicated features of our lives.

172
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Like software, let's build them with these small deposits that show we're here and we're invested.

173
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
When I asked my team which line of the zen they like best, one of my ops engineers said this one.

174
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Makes sense, right? He's a good ops engineer.

175
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
If something goes wrong, people want to know.

176
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
He loves this line because he says, if something's wrong with my code, I want to know.

177
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Interestingly, in the very same week in another conversation with one of my direct reports,

178
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
a developer said, if I hurt someone, I want to know.

179
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
With code, we can write more code to raise and log errors.

180
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But with humans, we have to rely on other humans to tell us when we broke them.

181
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And feedback is the tool we have to help others understand the impact that they have on us.

182
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
We owe it to ourselves and to each other to give timely, actionable feedback

183
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
that describes what happened and the impact that it had.

184
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
On a healthy team, if someone screws up, they shouldn't feel like they need to hide it or promit.

185
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
We understand that people make mistakes and feelings get hurt,

186
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
but we value each other enough to take responsibility for our actions and improve.

187
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
We don't let things pass silently because we know that letting things pass silently damages trust.

188
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The pain of giving or receiving negative personal feedback is only painful in the moment, but that's fleeting.

189
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Allowing it to pass silently is something that can accrue and damage teams permanently.

190
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The other day, I tweeted about how to respond when you wake up from a call with one of your...

191
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
you wake up to a wall of text from one of your developers who's like, oh my goodness, I broke this thing,

192
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I fixed this thing, I feel so terrible about it.

193
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And I said that you should respond to things like that by hearing them and affirming them

194
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and appreciating them and reminding them that it's okay to screw up.

195
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I was careful about the way I responded to this because I really love working on a team

196
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
where we can be open and vulnerable with each other about how we feel.

197
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's a signal that your team is on the right track if they can talk about their mistakes.

198
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
If they're hiding, if they're yelling, don't touch my garbage, that can indicate that they're scared.

199
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But if they come right up to your door and they say, I wish I had a trash bag as a prop right here,

200
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
look at my trash, look at my trash.

201
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Oh, my beautiful trash.

202
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That can indicate that they trust you, right?

203
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
They're not scared.

204
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So be kind to people when they show you their trash.

205
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It was probably hard for them to show you their trash.

206
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It gets easier for us the more we do it, so let's not let our errors pass silently.

207
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

208
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
When it comes to code, refuse the temptation to guess at someone's motives.

209
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Don't get blame and stew about it.

210
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You're only going to cause yourself more pain.

211
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
When you see code or behavior that frustrates you, don't assume the worst.

212
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Humans are complex and their actions are influenced by all kinds of ideas and experience

213
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
that you may never understand or have access to.

214
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Grab some time with them and care enough to ask.

215
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Ask where they're coming from.

216
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Ask what they were trying to accomplish, why they took that particular path.

217
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Offer to make them a cup of coffee and chat about it.

218
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And if you can't get blame and reach out to that person for whatever reason,

219
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
try to get some context from someone who might be able to help.

220
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Put your questions on the PR, open a GitHub issue.

221
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Address it, confront it, challenge directly and care personally.

222
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Refuse the temptation to guess.

223
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I really love this reflection from my lead Meghna on why this is one of her favorite lines.

224
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And I think it works for people really well, too.

225
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It can be really tempting, sadly, to explain away people.

226
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Oh, she's just a grumpy old sisset man.

227
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
She doesn't get it. She'll never get it.

228
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Or he's in sales. He doesn't care about how the code works.

229
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Or, you know, they're new and they don't...

230
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I just don't think they're going to deliver this feature in time, anywhere close to time.

231
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It can be really tempting to explain away people in these ways,

232
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
but if you set really clear expectations and give clear guidance

233
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
and have good documentation and show that you care personally and make it safe to fail,

234
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,000
then people will just exceed any expectations you ever could have had for them.

235
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And one final note for the managers in the room.

236
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I really tried to keep manager-specific advice in this talk to a minimum,

237
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
but I think this one's important.

238
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Your weekly one-on-one time is your time to beat the guessing game.

239
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Don't guess about your direct reports.

240
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Just use that time you have scheduled to ask open and meaningful questions

241
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
about the things that matter, about what's motivating them,

242
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
about what's frustrating them, about how they'd like to grow.

243
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Just use the time.

244
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So this, it's time for the last line of the Zen that we're going to focus on today.

245
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And what better time for the line is now is better than ever.

246
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Developers of all experience levels can get tripped up overthinking their work.

247
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Sometimes in the process of trying to figure out how to be the most efficient,

248
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
we can be vastly inefficient.

249
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Now is better than ever reminds us of the value of taking some action,

250
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
however small, to move closer to our goal.

251
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's oriented towards doing.

252
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Doing, even if we end up being wrong, because doing gives us information.

253
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
When I was a developer, I had a single sticky note on my monitor.

254
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's something my engineering manager said to me at a time

255
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
when I was being really hard on myself.

256
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Doing and being wrong is a lot better than not doing at all.

257
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He said this because he noticed how hard I could be on myself

258
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and how doubting myself was really holding me back.

259
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
He reminded me that our team, like my development environment,

260
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,000
was a safe place to try things out, even if that meant screwing up and breaking things.

261
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Sticky note helped me through some hard times as a developer,

262
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
and now it helps me as a manager.

263
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And there comes a time in my relationships with all of my direct reports,

264
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
no matter how senior they are, that I share this sticky note wisdom with them.

265
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I share it when I feel like they need it.

266
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Sometimes they need to hear this because they're being too hard on themselves.

267
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Sometimes they need to hear it because they're just having a hard time getting started.

268
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
The cool thing, everyone's needed this wisdom at some point.

269
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It doesn't matter how many years they've been working as a developer

270
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
or how much they know about Python.

271
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
They always need to hear this at some point.

272
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
That's because everyone benefits from feeling like they can just start where they are.

273
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
On a psychologically safe team, people feel safe to make mistakes

274
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
because they understand it's part of growth.

275
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
There's no fear that they'll be singled out or scapegoated.

276
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
On a healthy team, people seize the now, comfortable that they'll never be perfect.

277
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So there you have it, six things from the Zen of Python, interpreted for teams.

278
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I hope it's been useful to you.

279
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I hope you've been thinking about the teams you've been part of,

280
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
how you'd like to improve and strengthen them,

281
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and how the Zen inspires you personally.

282
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Because if you have been thinking about these things,

283
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
then you're ready for the third and final section of my talk, the Easter egg.

284
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Volunteers, this is your queue.

285
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Yes, the Easter egg.

286
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
The Easter egg.

287
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The Zen of Python is itself an Easter egg,

288
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
so it just made sense that my talk would have an Easter egg too.

289
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Right?

290
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Pi Texas volunteers are now coming around the room with something special for you.

291
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Thanks, Pi Texas volunteers.

292
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Y'all rock.

293
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Yes, it's an egg!

294
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Applause

295
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:41,000
So we know that the Zen of Python is itself an Easter egg.

296
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And we also know that the final line of the Zen of Python is as yet unwritten.

297
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And we remember that the Zen of Python started on a mailing list

298
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
in a spirit of playfulness and joy.

299
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And let's see what we can do with this,

300
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
an open to interpretation and an invitation to interpret it.

301
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So my challenge to you as you pop open your egg

302
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:21,000
is to write and share the 20th line of the Zen of Python.

303
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You've been thinking about your teams,

304
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
you've been thinking about what inspires you,

305
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
what challenges you, what you'd like to do better.

306
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You're ready! You're ready to write the 20th line.

307
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So inside the egg you're going to find some directions.

308
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I want you to write a phrase that you want to bring back to your team.

309
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
If you can hand write it, that's awesome.

310
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
There's something that happens in your brain when you make the pen or pencil move with your hand.

311
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
But you're welcome to type it out too.

312
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But just write something that you want to be reminded of

313
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
or something you'd stick on your monitor or something you'd tell someone new.

314
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Write something that'll make you smile.

315
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Write something that'll challenge you.

316
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Write the 20th line of the Zen of Python and then share it.

317
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Post it on Twitter.

318
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Use our conference hashtag.

319
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Use the ZOP20 hashtag.

320
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Take a picture, drop it in your Team Slack channel.

321
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Tag me if you'd like, I'd love to see.

322
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Tag juice analytics, we might make a data story with it.

323
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm really excited to read what you're dreaming about,

324
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
what's challenging you and how you want to grow.

325
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And I'm thrilled for the teams that you're part of.

326
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Long live the Zen.

327
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Long live Python.

328
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Stay in touch.

329
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Applause.
