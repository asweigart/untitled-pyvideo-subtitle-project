1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
All right, first landing talk is Ali Sevji.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,680
He's going to talk about Busy Beaver, the Chicago Python

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,800
Community Engagement Slackbot.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,180
Let's give him a round of applause.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:16,280
Hi, everybody.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,240
My name is Ali Sevji.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,160
I'm one of the organizers of the Chicago Python users group.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,160
And I'm here to talk to you about this community engagement

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,740
initiative I've been working on for the past few months called

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,740
Busy Beaver.

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,200
So we're really fortunate to have a fantastic community

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,080
of Pythonistas in the Windy City.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,580
And at the heart of this community

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,560
is the Chicago Python users group, or Chippy.

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,800
With over 4,600 members, Chippy is

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,640
one of the largest tech-focused communities

17
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,480
inside the United States.

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,600
We've been around for 15 years, and at that time,

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,200
we've had around 150-plus monthly meetings.

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,720
In addition to our general meeting

21
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,280
that happens once a month, we have a lot of special interest

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,600
groups for more niche interests.

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,960
So we have one for data, web development slash DevOps,

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,800
finance.

25
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,920
We recently started one on algorithms and coding

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,920
interviews to help people whiteboard.

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,160
We have one for lunch, so people that

28
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,400
can't make our evening meetups can attend that one.

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,680
And we recently started doing some open source spreads.

30
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,600
So last month, we sprinted on chippy.org.

31
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,800
We also have a monthly project night.

32
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,840
And this project night has two tracks.

33
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,740
There's a challenge project night track.

34
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,760
And here, there's a group of four people.

35
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,840
They mod program on an assignment together.

36
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,840
And we also have a BYO, bring your own project track,

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,380
where people just work on projects,

38
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,340
and they get help if they need it.

39
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,820
We also have a world-famous mentorship program.

40
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,340
This is a 13-week, one-on-one, project-based mentorship.

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,260
There's two cohorts a year.

42
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,420
There's around 20 to 30 people every single, sorry,

43
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,740
20 to 30 pairs every single cohort.

44
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,700
And at the end, the top 10 mentees

45
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,220
present their lightning tots at a Chippy May meeting.

46
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,600
The next one's going to be on May, May 9th in Chicago.

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,220
So if you're around, please come on by.

48
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,820
It's going to be a lot of fun.

49
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,100
So like most organizations, Slack

50
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,260
is our primary means of communication.

51
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,900
And it's really become ingrained within our community.

52
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,460
So we have a lot of channels focused

53
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,940
on different conversations.

54
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,940
Some of my favorites include Book Club.

55
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,700
There's one for Advent of Code.

56
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,660
And code review is always a lot of fun, too.

57
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,700
Slack has a lot of plugins.

58
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,040
And we use these plugins quite extensively.

59
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,220
But they don't really solve the specific problem that we have.

60
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,540
We're trying to build a tech-focused community.

61
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,460
And we have a different set of problems.

62
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,460
So try to foster conversations around technology

63
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,860
to keep people coming back.

64
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,900
So our Slack is only as good as our integrations, only

65
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,580
as good as our community.

66
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,300
So nothing really fit our specific use case.

67
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,420
So we got a team together.

68
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,940
And we let them loose on the problem.

69
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,140
After a little bit of design and a lot of hard work,

70
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,900
the end result was Busy Beaver.

71
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,580
And it's a Slack bot built specifically for the Chicago

72
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,340
Python workspace.

73
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,660
So the bot's mission is to increase engagement

74
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,500
within the Chicago Python community.

75
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,660
That's a pretty broad scope.

76
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,820
So what does it really mean?

77
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,420
What are some ways we can engage your community?

78
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,100
GitHub seems like a good place to start.

79
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,020
It's a social coding platform.

80
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,700
A lot of developers use GitHub.

81
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,660
But as an organization, we didn't really

82
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,380
have a lot of insight into what our community was working on,

83
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,980
what projects they were doing, what open source contributions

84
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,220
they were making, what things were they starring.

85
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,420
So working with GitHub seemed like a good place to start.

86
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,580
So the first feature we created was a GitHub summary bot.

87
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,860
And so what this did was, if you register with this bot,

88
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,660
every day at 2 o'clock, it goes out to GitHub,

89
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,020
collects all your public activity in the last day,

90
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,660
and it posts it within a channel.

91
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,380
It got a lot of great publicity, mostly from me.

92
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,820
So we decided to add another feature.

93
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,860
Over the past few months, the Chicago Python

94
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,820
at Chicago Python Twitter channel

95
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,140
is becoming a little bit more popular.

96
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,300
We're sharing more content.

97
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,940
So we decided to integrate this within our Slack workspace.

98
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,700
So the second feature we built was,

99
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,260
since not everybody on Slack follows us on Twitter,

100
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,100
we just reshare our tweets inside of that one channel.

101
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,740
So we released in January.

102
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,340
So far, we only have two features.

103
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,900
But we are an open source project,

104
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,980
released under the MIT license.

105
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,540
We have a lot of documentation showing

106
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,460
how to get started contributing.

107
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,100
We also have a project board with a lot of issues.

108
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,060
I've been tagging them with a good first issue,

109
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,100
how hard they are, how much effort they're going to take.

110
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,660
There's also a CI CD pipeline built in.

111
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,660
So if you get a feature out there, write some tests.

112
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,940
We can get it shipped into production really quickly.

113
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,620
So if you want to start getting contributing,

114
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,780
look at or read me.

115
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,340
Join the Chippy Slack.

116
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,740
I'm going to be sprinting on this project Monday

117
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,220
if anybody's around.

118
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,180
I have stickers.

119
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,340
If anyone wants to get stickers,

120
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,500
there could be some out there.

121
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,300
Find me.

122
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,300
If you make a PR, I will give you a button.

123
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,540
So there's some incentive there.

124
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,380
So thanks for your time.

125
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,060
But before I go, I just want to acknowledge

126
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,780
all my Chippy organizers.

127
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,660
Couldn't be up here without all their hard work.

128
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,420
And also to everybody on the busy work teams.

129
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,260
Thank you, everybody.

130
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:47,760
Thank you.

131
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,260
Thank you.

132
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:48,740
Thank you.

133
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,220
Thank you.

134
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:49,700
Thank you.

135
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,200
Thank you.

136
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,700
Thank you.

137
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,200
Thank you.

138
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,700
Thank you.

139
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,200
Thank you.

140
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Thanks for having me.

141
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,700
So 21 seconds left.

142
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,180
Very good.

143
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,700
Paul, are you ready to do your crap at the end?

144
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,200
Paul, are you set up for that?

145
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,700
I'm just holding the mic for you.

146
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,700
Oh, you're loved.

147
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,200
Do that.

148
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,700
It's OK.

149
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,400
I'll have a high five, because that's sweet.

150
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:06,900
OK.

151
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,400
OK.

152
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Okay, I can do it without notes.

153
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
I can do it without notes.

154
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Okay.

155
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo.

156
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Hello?

157
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Why is it going?

158
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Oops.

159
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Whoops.

160
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Computers are really hard.

161
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Yeah, who knew about computers?

162
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Okay.

163
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,400
That's a preview of slide number five, you all.

164
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
All right.

165
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Microphone?

166
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Yeah, thank you.

167
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,400
All right, Veronica is going to give us a talk about get hooked on images and up your documentation game.

168
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
Let's give her a round of applause.

169
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,400
All right.

170
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
We're going to do a 30 minute talk in five minutes.

171
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Are you guys stoked?

172
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Hold on to your hats.

173
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
All right.

174
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
So how many of you use Git and GitHub for your programming files?

175
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
Almost all of you.

176
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
That's fabulous.

177
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,400
Okay, so how many of you have explored different ways of documenting your projects?

178
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Could be creative use of comments, man pages, images, anything.

179
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
All right, all right, all right, all right.

180
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
I see some hands.

181
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,400
So we talked a little bit about this earlier today.

182
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Remember our cat.

183
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
We got to label our cat.

184
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,400
So you could have ASCII to explain where you are in a particular piece of code.

185
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,400
You could create whole man pages describing sections of your code.

186
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:04,400
But it's possible that some of these obvious comments aren't so obvious to you.

187
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
So the best docs are the ones that help you.

188
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
You need to learn to solve the problems that you have.

189
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,400
And your problem solving is going to be with you throughout your careers.

190
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Certainly longer than any particular flavor of JavaScript.

191
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,400
And I'm a self-taught second career developer.

192
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
And I manage to try on a lot of different hats.

193
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:32,400
So today I'm going to talk about a problem that I encountered as I started to shift from scripting to front end roles.

194
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
How I developed a solution.

195
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,400
And how we can learn to build the tools that we wish we had.

196
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:52,400
So this talk, while it's about tools, is really about opening yourself up to making the software you need to make your Git workflow work for you.

197
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
So not everyone uses Git the same way.

198
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,400
So before I talk about my Git venture, I should tell you where I was when I got started.

199
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,400
So when I learned Git, I learned it the way many people do.

200
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,400
A kind and loving friend told me, there are these five commands, okay?

201
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Don't ask me again.

202
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,400
It's been 72 times that you've asked.

203
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Just write down the five commands.

204
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Okay, okay.

205
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,400
So maybe I got a little bit into that person's hair.

206
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,400
I never did a Git intensive.

207
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,400
And everything that I've learned since then, I've learned as I've needed to do it.

208
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:41,400
So as you can guess, when I started to work on my own projects, I was a little uncomfortable with the whole Git time travel thing.

209
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,400
So I tried to keep things linear.

210
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,400
So I could push, pull, check out.

211
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:57,400
But anything fancier than that didn't feel like it, you know, it kind of felt out of the question.

212
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,400
However, there's a lot of things you can do with Git.

213
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,400
And I made a partial list right here.

214
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:16,400
So at the time I was relying, as I started to move to more visual work, I was continuing to rely on commit messages to guide this time travel.

215
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,400
And I researched how to write good commit messages.

216
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,400
But because I was making these small visual changes, sometimes just color changes.

217
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Do I add in hex values to my commits?

218
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,400
And I was making small changes and experimenting.

219
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,400
And so I had a lot of trouble finding the right commit to mix.

220
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,400
I started to wonder if there was a better way.

221
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
So I'm a super visual person.

222
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
I've always been a super visual person.

223
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
This is my second career.

224
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
I used to be a geologist.

225
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
We look at rocks.

226
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Rocks have orientations and we take pictures of them.

227
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,400
And we use these as documentation.

228
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:04,400
So as I was shifting, I started to look for ways that that visual documentation would show up.

229
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:11,400
One of my first open source projects was I was applying to Outreachy.

230
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
And I was trying to create a dashboard.

231
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:22,400
And I found myself really wishing, as I was looking at these requests, to know where the dashboard had been in the past.

232
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Because I was not only trying to learn a new language.

233
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Yes, I tried to apply to Outreachy using a language I hadn't worked in before.

234
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
So I was trying to learn that new language.

235
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:39,400
But I was also trying to kind of see where the dashboard had been.

236
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,400
And so I talked to the developers and said, do we have screenshots of this?

237
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
I'd really love to see it.

238
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,400
And they said, well, no one does that.

239
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
And I said, oh, wow.

240
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,400
There's a whole industry that doesn't think like me.

241
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,400
How amazing does that feel?

242
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,400
So I could have felt kind of bad about that.

243
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,400
But I realized that I wanted to make something.

244
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Is it five minutes already?

245
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
It really is.

246
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
It really is.

247
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
That's really depressing.

248
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Sorry.

249
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Let's give her a round of applause.

250
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Is that talk online tonight?

251
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Yeah.

252
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
The full version of that talk is online.

253
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,400
So you can also just go and watch it.

254
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
It'll be good.

255
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
I'll post it.

256
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
So next up, Mason.

257
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Paul, are we set to do a raffle prize?

258
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Another five minutes.

259
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
OK.

260
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
We do have raffle prizes.

261
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Our funny Python script to raffle them off

262
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,400
has not happened today, I guess.

263
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,400
The irony there is not lost on anybody.

264
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Anyone know a Python developer?

265
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Oh, that is really hyper contrast.

266
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Can y'all hear me?

267
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Talk right close to the mic.

268
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
All right.

269
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
So Mason is going to talk about Teal's program,

270
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
computer science, in every high school.

271
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
I love it.

272
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Let's give him a round of applause.

273
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,400
OK.

274
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
So in my talk earlier today, I mentioned

275
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
that I am a volunteer for Teal's.

276
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
And I'm going to take this quick time

277
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,400
to do a five-minute spiel on what Teal's is.

278
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
So Teal's is a nationwide program

279
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,400
that aims to pair industry professionals

280
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
with teachers who do not have the experience

281
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
that they need to be teaching computer science

282
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
in high schools, but are being forced

283
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,400
into these situations because of the demand

284
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
for computer science educators.

285
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
A lot of these statistics that I'm going to use

286
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
and put out here are going to be mostly

287
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
strictly based on Texas because I gave this talk

288
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,400
at HomeAway with my regional manager literally

289
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
yesterday, and I have all of those stats,

290
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,400
but I guarantee you these apply across the nation.

291
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
From what we've actually heard,

292
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Texas is actually doing a little bit better

293
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,400
on the computer science education than most.

294
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,400
So I think a couple years ago there was a poll

295
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,400
that came out that 85% of parents want their children

296
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
to be learning computer science in high school,

297
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
or in some form of primary education.

298
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Currently today in Texas, as it stands,

299
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,400
60% of schools do not offer a single computer science course

300
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,400
through their entire primary school curriculum,

301
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
all the way through secondary school and all of that.

302
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
So no CS whatsoever.

303
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
You get a typing course on how to use Word,

304
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
but you don't get any sort of programming.

305
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,400
And what ends up happening, and I give a similar talk

306
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
at Texas State University, my alma mater,

307
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,400
where I usually poll who's a math major,

308
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
and I tell them, congratulations,

309
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,400
you're now a computer science educator

310
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
because you're going to take this class in college

311
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
and you're going to know computer science

312
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
and you're going to be asked to teach this.

313
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
They basically pick a random teacher

314
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
who has had some sort of programming experience

315
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
in their collegiate career, and they go,

316
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,400
oh, you now have to teach AP Computer Science A,

317
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
which is the advanced Java course that basically covers

318
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
all the way through data structures

319
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
and object-oriented programming,

320
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
and oh, you only get one year to teach it.

321
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
It's extremely difficult.

322
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
I'm currently doing that right now at a school

323
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,400
about 20 miles that way in Idea Montopolis,

324
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
and I will tell you right now,

325
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
I came out of a program from a high school that did this,

326
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,400
and we're talking getting from Hello World in Java

327
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
to abstract classes and interfaces

328
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
and being able to implement them in a timed test

329
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
by the end of the school year.

330
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
It's insanely difficult.

331
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
So what we need is we need educators,

332
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,400
or what we need is we need professionals

333
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
to pair with these educators

334
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
who have the professional experience

335
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,400
that can teach and help us teach not only the students,

336
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
but the main goal is to help educate the teachers

337
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
so that way after a couple of years,

338
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,400
the teachers would be able to teach this class on their own

339
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
without our help anymore.

340
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
I guess the example that we use is

341
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,400
imagine that you had a single AP French class,

342
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
or you had a single French class in college,

343
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
and then you are told you're going to be given

344
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
10 weeks over the summer to learn French,

345
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,400
and now you're going to be teaching French AP next semester,

346
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
oh, and I hope all your students pass that test.

347
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
That's the reality of what's happening.

348
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
But what if we also said,

349
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
well, also what we're going to do at the same time,

350
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,400
we're going to put four native French speakers

351
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
in your classroom,

352
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
and they're going to help you not only teach the course,

353
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,400
but they're also going to help you teach how to teach the course.

354
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Makes it a little bit easier, right?

355
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
So that's what TEALS aims to be.

356
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,400
So there are varying levels of volunteership that you can do.

357
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,400
I myself went in, you know, deep end

358
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,400
with the I teach three times a week

359
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,400
from 8 to 9 o'clock before I go to work every day.

360
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
You can be a teaching assistant,

361
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
and that's kind of at the same level.

362
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
That's at the co-teach model.

363
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
If you don't have that kind of time to develop, to dedicate,

364
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
that's awesome.

365
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
You know, I understand we all have busy lives.

366
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,400
You could also do what's known as the lab assist model,

367
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
which is where, you know,

368
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
maybe the teacher has a little bit of experience in the classroom

369
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
teaching this,

370
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
but doesn't need like a full-on co-teach environment

371
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
to learn how to teach those courses.

372
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,400
So what we end up doing is you'll just be a lab assistant

373
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
two times a week.

374
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
You come in, the teacher teaches the course,

375
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
and you're there to answer questions during lab,

376
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
maybe help with some of the other stuff.

377
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
If that's still too much, and you don't have,

378
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
like you have very little time,

379
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,400
they offer things, a classroom enrichment program,

380
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
which basically turns into a guest lecture program

381
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
where you go in every other week,

382
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
maybe once a semester,

383
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
and enrich the class with your experience.

384
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Any level of time you can get,

385
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
they will find a place to put you.

386
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
And this is not also only in person.

387
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,400
They have an amazingly built remote classroom system

388
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
that they demoed for me yesterday at my talk at HomeAway,

389
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
and it's like unbelievable.

390
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
This is where education is going to go in the future

391
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
with remote educators,

392
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
and they're going to be leading the way with this tech,

393
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
because it's really cool.

394
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
So if you don't have a school in your local area,

395
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
and you still want to dedicate,

396
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
and you have this time to dedicate,

397
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
that's fine.

398
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,400
If you can get a webcam and a microphone,

399
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
they can set you up in your home,

400
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
and you can teach remotely.

401
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
So the main thing that we need here

402
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
is we need people to sign up.

403
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
If you are interested,

404
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,400
I would say go to teals12k.org slash volunteers,

405
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
or just check out the website, teals12k.

406
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
It has been worth everything.

407
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,400
It's really been worth it for me to get back in the classroom.

408
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,400
I came out of an extremely strong

409
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
high school computer science program.

410
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Three years in high school, computer science,

411
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
high school, got all the way through

412
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
computer science four and three years,

413
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
and did multiple competitive programming things.

414
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
I have more medals that say I know Java

415
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
than I care to admit.

416
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
Also, this curriculum is not all Java.

417
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
There are multiple classes.

418
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Java is kind of like the end course.

419
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
It's the top level AP.

420
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
There's a computer science principles AP course,

421
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
which teaches more about what the internet is and stuff,

422
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
and there's an intro course that they're piloting

423
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
that they're starting just in Python,

424
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
and they need Python developers to help with it,

425
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
and I'm out of time.

426
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Round of applause for Mason.

427
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
I can breathe again.

428
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
I have to leave this plugged in for him.

429
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Take it.

430
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Mason, stay right there.

431
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
You're going to be the prop in the next talk.

432
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Okay, so our next talk is Carl.

433
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Carl is our videographer.

434
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
So let's give Carl a round of applause

435
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
for doing a great video.

436
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,400
And also for this talk,

437
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,400
and my answer to, can you teach me some Python?

438
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Round of applause.

439
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,400
I used to hate that question.

440
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Now I love it because...

441
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
Not enough hands.

442
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,400
I whip one of these out...

443
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
I whip one of those out of my backpack.

444
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
I hand it to the person.

445
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
They say...

446
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Wow, how did it do that?

447
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
It didn't do it.

448
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Now it did it. Whoa!

449
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
It blakes.

450
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
At all.

451
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
I have them plug it in.

452
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
It's a USB thumb drive.

453
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Oh, by the way, it's Adafruit product 3333.

454
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Circuit Playground Express.

455
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,400
And then their file manager comes up.

456
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,400
It's a thumb drive.

457
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
They open code.py with an editor.

458
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
That's it.

459
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
So if you can right click and pick open with editor,

460
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
you can put that over there.

461
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Put that over there.

462
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Oh, well, that makes sense.

463
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,400
If we would just have done rehearsal, this would have worked.

464
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
We're rehearsing.

465
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
And there you've got some Python code,

466
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
and you can show them if you touch the things,

467
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
lights turn on, and if they say,

468
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
how do you make it turn off,

469
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
you can talk to them about Python code,

470
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
and within five minutes, they're engaged in programming.

471
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
No virtual environments, no downloading,

472
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
no project management,

473
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
none of that boring stuff.

474
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
It's boring compared to, hey, how did that do that?

475
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
So there you go.

476
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
I'm done.

477
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
All right.

478
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
So next up is Paul.

479
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Paul, what was your talk?

480
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
I was going to talk about custom argument types with argpars.

481
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
We're going to fix your mic first.

482
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Get a little closer to your mouth.

483
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Custom arg types with argpars.

484
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
All right.

485
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Custom arg types with argpars.

486
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Let's give him a round of applause.

487
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
So the last time I gave a lightning talk,

488
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
I went for 45 minutes.

489
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
So I wrote a script.

490
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
And I wrote it.

491
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
And I wrote it.

492
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
And I wrote it.

493
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
And I wrote it.

494
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
And I wrote it.

495
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
And I wrote it.

496
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
And I wrote it.

497
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
I wrote a script.

498
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
I hope I can get it done in five this time.

499
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
So I learned to use argpars

500
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
the last few months at my job.

501
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
And we needed to do some custom types.

502
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Who uses argpars in here?

503
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Writes CLI scripts

504
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
with command line arguments? Great.

505
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
So you can see I have

506
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
some sample code here

507
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
showing a simple parser.

508
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
I'm just going to run that.

509
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
And there's actually several arguments

510
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
that are defined.

511
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Let's just look at a few of them.

512
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
So the first one is name.

513
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
And if I put in a name

514
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
Alice.

515
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
We can see that

516
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
unrecognized arguments AliceO

517
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
because it didn't do dash dash.

518
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
I don't know why

519
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
this is

520
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
being honoree.

521
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
Okay.

522
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
So we see I put in Alice.

523
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
It's a default argument. It comes out as a string.

524
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
No big deal.

525
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Pretty basic.

526
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
If I want to say the type is going to be an integer

527
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
then I can add

528
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
And now

529
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
if I see the quantity is not in quotes

530
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
it's actually been converted to an int

531
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
and I can use it as an int.

532
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
I can also define other

533
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
custom arguments, argument types

534
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
if I write a method

535
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
that takes a string and will return

536
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
will check the contents.

537
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
So here's a case where I want to have a percent type.

538
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
So in my case I want to do a percent type

539
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
and it's going to be

540
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
So sometimes we want to give 110 percent

541
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
or our managers do.

542
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Sorry.

543
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
110 must be in the range

544
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
from 0 to 100.

545
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
So that's the first test we have.

546
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
Let's make it 50 percent.

547
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
And so now percent

548
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
has been validated to be 0 to 100

549
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
and also converted to a float

550
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
so that I can now just do direct

551
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
multiplication with it in my function.

552
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
But the big interesting one

553
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
is that we have a lot of enums

554
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
in our test environment.

555
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Large, small, medium,

556
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
brief

557
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
and testing for these arguments

558
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
we test for the name

559
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
and then we have to test for the string

560
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
of the enum and so forth

561
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
and then I thought that was very clunky.

562
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
I like using is for testing enum values.

563
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
So I wrote a

564
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
mixin

565
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
to go with our enum class

566
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
that allows me to use it directly

567
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
or almost directly as an argument type.

568
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
And in this type we

569
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
define a method.

570
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
It's going to take our string.

571
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
It's a class method. It's going to take a string

572
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
and it's going to try to actually use the

573
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
indexed access on an enum to give me back

574
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
the enum that matches.

575
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
If not I get a key error in which case I'll return

576
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
not valid.

577
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
I also have the string because

578
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
what I want, I think if you notice here

579
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
that if there's

580
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
no color provided

581
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
we're actually getting the list of the valid colors.

582
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
So I can say

583
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
let's say color is

584
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
some bad color. It's going to say

585
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
sorry that's not a valid color.

586
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
If I can say red

587
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
then what I got was actually not the

588
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
string red. I actually got the enum

589
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
color.red

590
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
and then if I want to

591
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
when I use that in my code

592
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
I can treat it

593
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
as an enum. So here I've got parsed

594
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
the arguments and now I'm going to say

595
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
if the color is

596
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
color.gold

597
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
I want to print pretty

598
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
and

599
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
oh I'm still doing 110%.

600
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
That's not so good.

601
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Color is gold

602
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
and we're pretty.

603
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
So that little mixin

604
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
is sufficient

605
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
to take any enum

606
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
add it as a mixin

607
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
for archetyping and then I can

608
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
treat it as an argument

609
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
saying type is

610
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
color.argType and the choices are

611
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
color and that's all I need

612
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
to do to make that enum work

613
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
as a valid archetype for

614
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
argPars.

615
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
And this is a gist on github

616
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
gistgithub.com

617
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
slash PTMCG so you can

618
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
pull it down from there. Thank you.

619
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Forty minutes.

620
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400
Jay's going to give us a talk.

621
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
Title's not there so I need to look up over here.

622
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Ask him.

623
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
Oh okay. So Jay's going to give us a talk

624
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
building and deploying a

625
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
site for beginners. Let's give

626
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
him a round of applause.

627
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Okay so my journey with

628
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
coding has really started in

629
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
2012. It was with this

630
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
2014 with this online

631
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
programming class called Team Treehouse.

632
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
So who here has been coding with

633
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Python for about a

634
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
year or less?

635
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Okay very few of us.

636
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Who knows someone that they

637
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
want to tell

638
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Python that hey this is a good programming

639
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
language you can learn about for a

640
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
complete newbie? We got

641
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
some people right? So how would you

642
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
introduce that to them? There's some bootcamps you can

643
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
take in different areas

644
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
in different cities but what if you're

645
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
really remote somewhere? So my

646
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
journey started like with here.

647
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
It didn't end here actually.

648
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
But what I love about this system

649
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
is with Team Treehouse

650
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
they have so many different languages.

651
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
I was actually on a tech to be

652
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
program of theirs. This is a subscription

653
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
based model, $24 a month.

654
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
First I was actually trying to be

655
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
a full stack of JavaScript.

656
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
But I like how

657
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Python is typed and how

658
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
I was reading it. That actually switched over

659
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
to there. And I was actually

660
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
learning how to build my own website.

661
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
So I'll show that to you right now.

662
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
And

663
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
it was, it was

664
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
it started with this program

665
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
but it turned into

666
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
a series of YouTube videos which I'll show in just a moment.

667
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
But this is what I built.

668
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
This is just, I built this

669
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
with Flask. I'm running this on SQLite

670
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
server. I deployed it on the node.

671
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
So

672
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
then I also used Bootstrap to

673
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
design the interface.

674
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
It's very simple but I have

675
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
an account. I can reset my email if I don't

676
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
remember it. I can change

677
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
my photo anytime. So for someone

678
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
who you want to show Python to

679
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
and say hey you can build your own website.

680
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
So who here has

681
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
their own website?

682
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Who here has designed it and built

683
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
it on their own? Good.

684
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
Yeah so that's the power of

685
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
Python and if

686
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
you know someone who wants to demonstrate their work

687
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
this could be the place

688
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,400
for it. So what ended up happening was

689
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,400
I didn't need to use Team Treehouse.

690
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Actually there's this

691
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
guy, I think he's the best

692
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
as far as step by step tutorials

693
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
on YouTube. It's free.

694
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
He does, he starts actually

695
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
with a lot of basic Python

696
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,400
language concepts

697
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
and in his videos

698
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
it's kind of a rabbit hole like for example

699
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
what is a

700
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
closure? Before that he talks about

701
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
what is a first class function and before that

702
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
he talks about what is a

703
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
decorator or something like that in that order.

704
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
So he has

705
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,400
this amazing class tutorial series and there's also

706
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
a Django tutorial series

707
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,400
that it's about maybe

708
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
five to six hours total

709
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,400
but I mean I love to dive

710
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
into things deep

711
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
when I'm looking at them. So

712
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
it ended up being maybe

713
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
ten hours in total. But this

714
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
will get you from

715
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,400
zero to knowing how to

716
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
access Linux, build SSH,

717
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
encrypt and make your site

718
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
secure because that's

719
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
kind of a complicated process.

720
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
This should not be so but

721
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
it was. But that's okay.

722
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
I also have

723
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
so with that

724
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
what I learned along the way

725
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,400
just for

726
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
someone like me who's learning

727
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
Python really on my

728
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,400
own, I've been

729
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
using OneNote to build a glossary.

730
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
I know there's a glossary and there's documentation

731
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
online already for these

732
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
different packages. But what

733
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
I've done is sometimes I just say

734
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
things in my own words. So for example

735
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
you can see here I was trying to learn about

736
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
SQLAlchemy.

737
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Before that I actually was reading just

738
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
about SQLAlchemy itself.

739
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
So this is what

740
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
I would use as reference because

741
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
instead of having to access a website I can do this

742
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
offline. And like I said

743
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
it's in my own words. I also put down procedures

744
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
there.

745
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
And so that was a lot of help.

746
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Next

747
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
this is

748
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
I don't know if anybody uses this but

749
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
at least for Windows this is a great

750
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,400
command line interface

751
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
called Commander. You can have multiple tabs

752
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
open. This is in PowerShell.

753
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
You can just also add

754
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,400
another one. Let's say it's

755
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,400
Command

756
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Commander. So

757
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,400
that can be there as well.

758
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,400
You can have all these tabs open and available.

759
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,400
And I've been using

760
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
GitHub for my code.

761
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
And apart from that

762
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
I did a lot of this on my own

763
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
in my house, in coffee

764
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,400
shops.

765
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
So if you know

766
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
someone who wants to learn this language

767
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
they can learn it online

768
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
and actually do it pretty much

769
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
for free at the start. But eventually

770
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
you want to get to know

771
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
people and that's what I did. So

772
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
that's why I'm here. I just found out about this

773
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
convention two days ago. So

774
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,400
that is all for me.

775
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
Alright.

776
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,400
I have an idea

777
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
what the answer might be.

778
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Let's have a round of applause.

779
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Hello again everybody.

780
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
This will be a quick talk.

781
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
I get this question a lot of times

782
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,400
being a test guy and I gave the whole talk about

783
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,400
EGAD, how do we write better tests. So which

784
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,400
one is better? Unit test or pie test?

785
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
What should we pick for writing our tests?

786
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
Before I give my personal

787
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
opinion of answer I want to just compare the two

788
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,400
and just kind of

789
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,400
shake out things. So has

790
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,400
everyone seen the Python developer survey from

791
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400
2018?

792
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Yes, no, maybe? Yeah, yeah. If you haven't

793
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
just Google it, it gives a whole bunch of cool

794
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
statistics on the Python developer

795
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
community that was done in collaboration

796
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
with the Python Software Foundation as well as JetBrains.

797
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
If you look at that survey

798
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
it's interesting. Of the people who

799
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
are using test frameworks in Python

800
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
46% use pie test

801
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
whereas only 32% use unit test.

802
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
Unit test

803
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
is pretty nice. The best thing about

804
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,400
unit test is that it comes with the standard library.

805
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
You don't need to install anything extra, it's

806
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
there from the get go. There is nothing wrong

807
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,400
or particularly bad

808
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
about unit test.

809
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
However, when you look at pie test

810
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
pie test is a little bit more powerful

811
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
and a little bit cleaner. When you

812
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
write your tests in pie test you can

813
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
write them as functions. Whereas in unit

814
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,400
test it shoe horns you into a class

815
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
structure. Personally I prefer

816
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,400
the functional style of writing

817
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,400
test functions.

818
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
Some other things, with pie test you get those fixtures

819
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
that are more reusable.

820
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400
You also can scope fixtures

821
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
to individual test level

822
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
versus module level, it's really nice.

823
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
And pie test also has plug-ins

824
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
galore. If there's a plug-in

825
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
for something you want, pie test

826
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
probably has it. If you want parallel execution

827
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
pie test extest. If you want code

828
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
coverage, pie test cub. If you

829
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
want integrations with Django or

830
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,400
Flask, it's there.

831
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
I also just want to shout out, in case you missed it

832
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Nose is dead. I strongly

833
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
recommend not using the Nose framework.

834
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
So

835
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
now to my opinions. Overall

836
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
I think Python is one of the best languages

837
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
for test automation period.

838
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
It's because it's Pythonic, it's

839
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
easy to pick up for beginners, it's powerful for

840
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,400
power users. I also personally

841
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
think pie test is one of the best frameworks in

842
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
understanding language. Particularly because

843
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
it has test functions, because

844
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
of its plug-ins, and also

845
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,400
because of its fixtures. It's a very, very

846
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,400
nifty way of handling things.

847
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
Personally, I also like pie test BDD2.

848
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
BDD,

849
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,400
behavior driven development. If you don't know what that is

850
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
I recommend you look it up. It's a really cool way to write tests.

851
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
And so with all that to say,

852
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
personally I prefer pie test over

853
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
unit test. Thank you.

854
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Alright, let's give Ernest

855
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,400
a round of applause.

856
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
Hello, I'm Ernest.

857
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
I like to bicycle because it makes me feel strong

858
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
and beautiful.

859
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
I also work for the Python Software

860
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
Foundation. If you're not aware of what the

861
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
Python Software Foundation is, we're going to do that

862
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
really quickly. First off, it is

863
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
a legal entity that takes care of the copyright,

864
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
trademark, and intellectual property

865
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
for the Python programming language.

866
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
We also support the Python

867
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,400
community via infrastructure, both technical

868
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
and fiscal. From a technical

869
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,400
perspective, it's things like Python.org

870
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,400
and PyPI.org. From a

871
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,400
fiscal perspective, we can support any

872
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
project that aligns with

873
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
our mission by letting them sort of

874
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
hang out under the umbrella of our 501c3

875
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
status. We also

876
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
provide grants worldwide.

877
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Over $300,000

878
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,400
in counting and sort of going up with time.

879
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
And 75% of those grants

880
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,400
are distributed outside of the US.

881
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
Those grants go to things like

882
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
the Django Girls, PyLadies

883
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
workshops, meetups, and

884
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
regional Python conferences

885
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
like...

886
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
There's one in Texas. What's it called?

887
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Yeah, oh, PyTexas.

888
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Right.

889
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Additionally, the PSF puts on

890
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
PyCon every year. If you're not aware

891
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
of what PyCon is, PyCon is a

892
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
conference that happens in, I think it's

893
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Cleveland, Texas.

894
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,400
So it's only three hours

895
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
from here.

896
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,400
Oh, I'm sorry. It's actually

897
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
in Cleveland, Arkansas.

898
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
So it's eight, nine hours

899
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
from here.

900
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
Oh, Tennessee. Cleveland, Tennessee.

901
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
Which is

902
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
fourteen hours from here?

903
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Sixteen? Oh, here we go. Okay, so

904
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Cleveland, Ohio.

905
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
So it's a twenty hour drive.

906
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
And it's not too

907
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
late to come. And as a matter

908
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
of fact, if you want, you could just like

909
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
take a caravan with me. I'm heading back

910
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
that way in my car after

911
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
PyTexas. So you could just get in your car

912
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
and come along with me.

913
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
But sincerely, there are some tickets left for PyCon

914
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
if you haven't made

915
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,400
arrangements yet.

916
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
And in preparation for this

917
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
lightning talk, I realized that next time

918
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
I do a road trip, there are a lot of

919
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
Cleveland's I could go see.

920
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
Alright, round of applause.

921
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Let me introduce you

922
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
and then you can go.

923
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
Michael. Michael put his talk title as

924
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Senior Network Security Infrastructure

925
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Engineer. I think that's your title. I thought I was asking

926
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
my title, not my talk's title. I was confused

927
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
why there wasn't another field. I thought you'd want

928
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
to know what the talk was about, too.

929
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,400
So I went back to edit it and there was no other field.

930
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
Anyway, that's who I am.

931
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Alright, so the talk is actually

932
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
it's not how good this happened to me.

933
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
No, it isn't. It's Python Unicode

934
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
Adventures. Let's give him a round of applause.

935
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
So spoiler alert.

936
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
This talk is recycled

937
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
and also you're getting the five minute version of a

938
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
thirty minute talk.

939
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
But anyway, this is about Unicode

940
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
and the problems that I've had with it.

941
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
And just the simple

942
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
fact, first of all

943
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
not doing live coding demo here.

944
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
These are the kinds of

945
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
problems that you run into

946
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
trying to deal with Unicode

947
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
versus ASCII in Python.

948
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
The long and short of it is that

949
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
back in the day we all used ASCII

950
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
and Python was built back in the day

951
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
and it still wants to use ASCII

952
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
most of the time. The hilarious

953
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
thing about this particular error

954
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
is that the program

955
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
crashes while trying to

956
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
print a Unicode

957
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
character and then successfully

958
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
prints the Unicode character

959
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
in the stack trace.

960
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Now you may

961
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
have noticed

962
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
that the problem here is that I'm using

963
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Python 2 now if you're like me

964
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
and you have to maintain some legacy code

965
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
it's a fact of life, you have to live with it

966
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
and at least not break things that were already

967
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
working. But assuming

968
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
that you switch over to

969
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
Python 3, that should fix all

970
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
of your problems, right? Because Python 3

971
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
uses Unicode by default instead of ASCII.

972
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
So it's a lot

973
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
simpler, we just print and we get the

974
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
same crash and now in Python 3 it fails

975
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
to print the stack trace correctly.

976
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
So

977
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
I'm not sure that I have time

978
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
to get through all of the reasons why this

979
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
is a problem and continues to be a problem in 2019

980
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
so let me see if I can

981
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
give you the short version.

982
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
ASCII was nice because

983
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
it skipped a lot of steps. We had a direct

984
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
mapping of characters

985
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
to numbers

986
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
and those numbers were all

987
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
one byte.

988
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
With Unicode though

989
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,400
things get a little more complicated.

990
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
We have direct mappings

991
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,400
of characters to numbers

992
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
but those numbers are not

993
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
mapped directly to bytes. There are

994
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
actually a lot of different types of encoding that you can get

995
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,400
for Unicode. Some of them represent

996
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
all characters. Well, not

997
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
all characters. Some of them represent more characters

998
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
than others. And the one that you're going to be using

999
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
most of the time is going to

1000
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
be UTF-8

1001
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
which will

1002
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
I don't know what's going on

1003
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
here. There's some problem with it.

1004
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
You know what?

1005
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
I would explain it.

1006
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
So anyway

1007
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
when you're working in Python specifically

1008
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Unicode is a type of variable

1009
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
although if you're on

1010
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Python 3

1011
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
skipping over a bunch of stuff here

1012
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
this is the nice little disambiguation table

1013
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
that you should use.

1014
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Basically in Python 3

1015
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
strings by default are representations

1016
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
of Unicode code points

1017
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
so they don't map directly to bytes

1018
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
until they have to.

1019
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
In other words until you're outputting them

1020
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,400
to something outside of the Python language

1021
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
like a file or your

1022
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
terminal or the network

1023
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
and at the point where you have to convert

1024
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
a Python Unicode

1025
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
object into some bytes

1026
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
you have to go through your encoding

1027
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
and you have to basically settle

1028
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
on how that character should

1029
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
be represented in bytes.

1030
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
According to the official

1031
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Python how to

1032
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
on how to use Unicode in your code

1033
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
basically don't

1034
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
care about encodings as much as

1035
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
possible. Just use the built in

1036
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,400
Unicode objects that the language gives you internally

1037
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
and let the interpreter

1038
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
handle the encoding

1039
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
when it needs to talk to something else.

1040
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
But as we saw earlier that actually

1041
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,400
doesn't work a lot of times.

1042
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
You can handle the encoding yourself

1043
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
manually by using

1044
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Unicode or .dcode on your

1045
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
string objects.

1046
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
To make

1047
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
a long story short

1048
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Python does its best

1049
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
to detect the preferred encoding of the file

1050
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
it's writing to.

1051
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
So when you're running a script

1052
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,400
in a terminal it's going to actually

1053
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
ask the terminal, hey terminal what kind of

1054
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
encoding do you want?

1055
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
I don't know why it's

1056
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
doing that.

1057
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
And so the

1058
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
reason that

1059
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,400
the reason we can still get this

1060
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,400
crash even on Python 3

1061
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
is that it's possible to misconfigure your terminal.

1062
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
If any of you have worked inside of

1063
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,400
you know like Docker containers for example

1064
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,400
if you just build like the default

1065
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
Debian Docker container and you go in there

1066
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
and you try to use Unicode you may get a crash.

1067
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
Because out of the box it doesn't

1068
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
have a lot of environment variables

1069
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,400
set and there's one

1070
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,400
in particular

1071
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
here we go

1072
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,400
lcctype is an environment

1073
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
variable that is going to signal to

1074
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
not only Python but to a lot of programs

1075
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
what type of encoding they should use when they're

1076
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
talking to the system. And so if you

1077
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
explicitly tell it that it should use Ascii

1078
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,400
then it's going to try to use

1079
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
Ascii and it's going to fail to print

1080
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
this multi byte number

1081
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
in one byte.

1082
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
So yeah that's kind of

1083
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
the long and short of my talk or I guess the short of my talk

1084
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
5 minute version anyway.

1085
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
And there are further problems if you try to do this

1086
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
at the end of the stage.

1087
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Alright round of applause.

1088
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
And on that note. Okay so Jeremy is going to give us a talk

1089
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
making PyTexas happen

1090
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
legally.

1091
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Alright cool. So

1092
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
some of you may have been coming

1093
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
to PyTexas for a while.

1094
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,400
We might be the oldest

1095
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,400
regional Python conference

1096
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,400
in the US

1097
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,400
at least. Apparently the question

1098
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
is whether PyOhio

1099
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
happened earlier or later in the year

1100
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,400
in 2007. That's like

1101
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,400
the question about who is actually

1102
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
the

1103
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
first regional.

1104
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
Anyway so we started out as PyCamp

1105
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
Texas and then

1106
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
two years later

1107
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,400
adopted the name PyTexas.

1108
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
And then

1109
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
for a few years we carried along and

1110
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
then

1111
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
until 2012 the important thing to note

1112
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,400
is there was one person running this group

1113
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,400
running the whole thing okay.

1114
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,400
Which is okay because it was actually only a couple dozen

1115
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,400
people that would come to each year.

1116
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,400
I think I started coming in 2010

1117
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
and there were like 30 or 40 of us

1118
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,400
in Waco.

1119
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,400
And then as we grew

1120
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
it became more and more difficult for people

1121
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,400
to, for this one

1122
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,400
person to do it. It was Sheila Allen if you

1123
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
know her.

1124
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
So in 2013 Sheila kind of backed away

1125
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,400
and we had a group

1126
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,400
organize it for the first time ever.

1127
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
And that group

1128
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,400
also decided to start charging because

1129
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,400
we would have people say yeah sure I'm coming and then

1130
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,400
they wouldn't come. And that by the way

1131
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
is the primary reason why people

1132
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
pay to go to the conference.

1133
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,400
So that

1134
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
led to a problem right. If we're going to take

1135
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
money including sponsored dollars

1136
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
how do we do that? Well

1137
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,400
as

1138
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400
Ernest just mentioned the PSF

1139
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
jumped in and helped us out with

1140
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
funding. We could send our funds

1141
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
to the PSF and then they would reimburse us for

1142
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
charges and that worked out really well

1143
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
except it took a while. And everybody

1144
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
had to put dollars like you know like we

1145
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
we would get reimbursed and all that.

1146
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,400
And also

1147
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,400
the logistics have improved greatly in the last

1148
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,400
five years, in the last two years.

1149
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
But it just took

1150
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,400
was kind of a problematic process for us.

1151
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
So we thought it would be easy and we decided

1152
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
to just do it ourselves. So in 2014

1153
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
we founded the Pi Texas

1154
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,400
Foundation which is a registered non-profit

1155
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,400
corporation here in Texas.

1156
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
And the next year we got the Department

1157
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,400
of the Treasury to agree that we're a 501C3

1158
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,400
because if we ever go

1159
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,400
under any profits that we make we'll actually

1160
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,400
go to another non-profit. Guess

1161
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,400
which one it would go to.

1162
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,400
And

1163
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,400
then we even got

1164
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
come on

1165
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
there's actually

1166
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
I don't know why that would be

1167
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
challenging.

1168
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,400
Cool.

1169
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
Well you can see it here. I don't know

1170
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
why you can't see it up there. But

1171
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
we got a logo. It's blue

1172
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,400
and it's yellow and it's in the shape of Texas.

1173
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
And we actually talked to the Python

1174
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
the PSF logo committee

1175
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,400
because they have for very good reasons

1176
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,400
have to protect their trademarks.

1177
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,400
They actually said they liked this one so that's nice.

1178
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,400
So anyway here's the

1179
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,400
world since then.

1180
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
We were in College Station again in 2014

1181
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,400
we get our 501C3

1182
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
and boom we're in 2019

1183
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
now. So what's the governance of the

1184
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
PyTexas Foundation? There's a board

1185
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
of directors. Currently there are three of us.

1186
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,400
There are four officerships

1187
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
that are sort of mandated

1188
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,400
by our bylaws.

1189
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
Interestingly if you

1190
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
note that there are three

1191
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,400
directors and four officers

1192
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
that means that one person is doing

1193
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,400
two people's jobs. And

1194
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,400
the good news is we can grow our board.

1195
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,400
So we have some committees

1196
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,400
for example for the conference. Semi-annual

1197
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,400
meetings that's all.

1198
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,400
So we're interested in

1199
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,400
building support for the foundation.

1200
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,400
It is not

1201
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,400
that much work. It's mostly

1202
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,400
coming to meetings and making sure that

1203
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,400
you sign things.

1204
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,400
So if you're at all interested in the foundation

1205
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,400
and I'm talking to some of you who've been around

1206
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,400
in the community for a while and also

1207
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,400
some of you who are brand new who can bring new ideas

1208
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,400
to it. We're really

1209
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,400
interested in hearing from you.

1210
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,400
Can't promise a board seat but I can promise that

1211
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,400
we will find a way to

1212
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,400
let you contribute to

1213
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,400
the community. So

1214
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,400
let us know. Show up at meetings.

1215
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,400
They're on Google Hangouts. It's not hard. And really

1216
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,400
that's it. And then one last thing that

1217
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,400
I think is important but

1218
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,400
Google doesn't is

1219
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,400
man it

1220
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
really doesn't like. So the foundation

1221
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,400
is not the conference. Every year

1222
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,400
kind of a new group of people could

1223
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,400
work on the conference.

1224
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,400
There's a standing committee

1225
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,400
that has worked on it but they're not at all

1226
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,400
the same. So I think Dustin tomorrow

1227
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
is going to be talking about how to contribute

1228
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,400
to the conference which is a much

1229
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,400
more immediate need every year.

1230
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,400
But the foundation

1231
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,400
and the conference are not the same. I'm really glad you took the picture

1232
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,400
of the broken slide.

1233
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,400
And that's it. That's it for me.

1234
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,400
Thanks.

1235
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,400
Applause

1236
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,400
Do you think you can make it work again?

1237
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,400
Let's try it.

1238
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,400
We're going to get this done.

1239
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,400
This is going to be really

1240
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,400
awkward but it's going to work.

1241
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,400
And

1242
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,400
in order to do this talk you're going to have to

1243
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,400
direct your attention to the other screen.

1244
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,400
No it will be on the screen.

1245
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,400
It will be on the screen right when you start.

1246
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,400
To be fair the screen cast did work

1247
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,400
the moment I sat down.

1248
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,400
Laughter

1249
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,400
Laughter

1250
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
Laughter

1251
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,400
Applause

1252
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,400
Alright this is going to be hard.

1253
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,400
I love it. I love it.

1254
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,400
Laughter

1255
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,400
Hold on.

1256
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,400
You're going to see

1257
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,400
something.

1258
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,400
Laughter

1259
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,400
Laughter

1260
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,400
Okay. Alright.

1261
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,400
Let's give Josh a round of applause.

1262
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,400
Applause

1263
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,400
Applause

1264
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,400
Is this working?

1265
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,400
Everyone turn your heads.

1266
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,400
Laughter

1267
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,400
Laughter

1268
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,400
This is as good as it's going to get alright.

1269
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,400
There we go.

1270
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,400
Okay so when I showed up today

1271
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,400
I wasn't exactly planning on giving a lightning

1272
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,400
talk but over lunch I was talking to

1273
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,400
and I was showing this really cool terminal emulator

1274
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,400
program and he was like oh

1275
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,400
you should present on this. There are a lot of

1276
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,400
guys that like hacking with python and I go oh

1277
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,400
that's fair. And I know when you're not

1278
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,400
surrounded by other people who are enthusiastic

1279
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,400
about python or actually developing on your own

1280
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,400
computers that you might kind of get the itch

1281
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,400
to develop in python. Well this can kind of

1282
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,400
scratch that. Here we have

1283
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,400
our handy dandy

1284
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,400
boom. There we are. We are at home

1285
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,400
on your android device using termux

1286
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,400
on our phone. I mean we can do simple things.

1287
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,400
You want to do some

1288
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,400
minor subtraction.

1289
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,400
There it is. You're like oh that's

1290
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,400
pretty cool Sorensen but what if I want to develop

1291
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,400
on my phone. Like I really want to

1292
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,400
develop. I said oh I hear you.

1293
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,400
Okay so here we are.

1294
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
We're running a tmux session so

1295
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,400
I can just simply transfer over

1296
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
to another window and I go okay

1297
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,400
I want to write something

1298
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,400
so I'm going to pull up my faithful

1299
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,400
emacs client and

1300
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,400
I'm going to open my little python

1301
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,400
development project. And this

1302
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,400
I cobbled together over lunch.

1303
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,400
It's a small script

1304
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,400
that takes in a user input. Oh

1305
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,400
is this mirrored? Oh god.

1306
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,400
Okay.

1307
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,400
Well it takes

1308
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,400
in a user input and translates

1309
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,400
it to morse code

1310
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,400
and then vibrates the phone. It does a little

1311
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,400
system OS call in morse

1312
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,400
code. Just

1313
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,400
because.

1314
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,400
And so I'm not going to do

1315
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,400
any of this live so we'll switch

1316
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,400
over to another tmux window

1317
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,400
and

1318
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,400
go and call our

1319
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,400
little morse generator through

1320
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,400
python. Well that's pretty cool.

1321
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,400
There we go. Now it's running and it's asking for

1322
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,400
our input. Let's see what I can

1323
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,400
spell sideways. Let's see if there's

1324
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,400
a pytexas

1325
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,400
and pyworks whatever.

1326
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,400
And then we run it and

1327
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,400
you can't feel it but I can. My phone's vibrating

1328
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,400
and it's punching out the morse code

1329
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,400
there. So if you're

1330
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,400
ever just needing development public

1331
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,400
there you go.

1332
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,400
That's it.

1333
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,400
Alright.

1334
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,400
Paul, thank you.

1335
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,400
We did it.

1336
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,400
We did it.

1337
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,400
We did it.

1338
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,400
Alright.

1339
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,400
We only have one last time to do.

1340
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,400
Actually we have two last

1341
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,400
things to do. Okay so

1342
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,400
I'm going to

1343
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,400
raffle off, not raffle to

1344
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,400
the speakers. I'm going to give

1345
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,400
to one of the speakers. Hold on.

1346
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,400
To one of the speakers I'm going to give

1347
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,400
this lovely water bottle

1348
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,400
that is our speakers gift by the way.

1349
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,400
So if next year

1350
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,400
you become a speaker, get a talk

1351
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,400
accepted at the conference, submit a CFP

1352
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,400
you might win maybe not this exact water bottle

1353
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,400
but something quite nice like it.

1354
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,400
As our appreciation

1355
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,400
for all the speakers that have done a really excellent job

1356
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,400
giving a talk today. We don't have

1357
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,400
enough for all the lightning talk speakers. We have one

1358
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,400
for one of them. So we're just going to

1359
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,400
I don't know why I'm showing it

1360
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,400
twice. We're just going to random not choice this right now

1361
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,400
and see who it is. That's Andy.

1362
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,400
Andy, congratulations.

1363
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,400
Thank you.

1364
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,400
It's a very powerful water bottle.

1365
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,400
Okay so thank you to all the lightning

1366
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,400
talk speakers. Thanks for all the talks today.
