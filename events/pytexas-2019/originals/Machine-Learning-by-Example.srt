00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
This is Gabby, she's a Google Developer Advocate.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,720
She also maintains an intimidating Lego collection,

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,800
which is, I think, a perfect way of describing it,

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,880
because I'm definitely afraid of stepping on one Lego,

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,760
let alone thousands of Legos.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,680
So she's gonna talk to us a little bit

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,360
about machine learning.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,480
So, welcome, Gabby.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,480
Thank you.

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,300
Thank you.

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,140
Thank you.

12
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,980
Thank you.

13
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,820
Thank you.

14
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,640
Thank you.

15
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,480
Thank you.

16
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,360
Good afternoon.

17
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,600
I think it's afternoon, so good afternoon.

18
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,080
I'm gonna give you a spoiler.

19
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,760
I'm not gonna talk about machine learning per se,

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,320
because I don't know machine learning.

21
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,440
I'm a developer.

22
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,680
What I know, it's APIs.

23
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,400
So what I'm gonna show you and teach you here

24
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,600
is how to use machine learning APIs

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,920
for you to use in your own applications

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,760
without having to know machine learning.

27
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,600
So that's the point of my talk,

28
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,560
and I hope you like it.

29
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,160
So let's start.

30
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,880
So what is machine learning?

31
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,680
It's about solving problems without specific rules.

32
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,880
It's not able to learn by the example

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,920
and set up new answers based on the example

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,200
that you just gave to them.

35
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,160
And I have a colleague that says

36
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,360
machine learning is just a thing labeler, essentially.

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,340
And on the Tuesdays, it's kind of like that.

38
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,640
And if you can label anything,

39
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,520
you can process the data and then create predictions

40
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,760
and that kind of stuff.

41
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,400
So I wanna do an exercise with you first.

42
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,480
How would you identify the following images

43
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,120
that I have in here?

44
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,200
I have an apple, and I have an orange.

45
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,280
So tell me, how would you differentiate

46
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,580
one thing from another?

47
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,760
Color?

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,680
Shape, okay.

49
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,520
So someone said color.

50
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,560
And if you have this, how do you differentiate that?

51
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,280
Just by shape, right?

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,200
I could create a script before when it was red and orange

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,480
that could count how many pixels red I have,

54
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,480
how many pixels orange I have,

55
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,120
and then based on the ratio, say it's an apple,

56
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,160
it's an orange, but if I have a green apple,

57
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,360
those just go out of the blue.

58
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,980
So this doesn't work.

59
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,160
So what about a dog and a muffin?

60
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,940
That's easier to differentiate, right?

61
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,560
The dog has two eyes, a nose, a mouth,

62
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,020
and a muffin just looks nice.

63
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,800
But what if you have this?

64
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,040
Is that a dog and a muffin?

65
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,160
That's a bit different, difficult.

66
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,160
And this, it's a mouth, or I don't know the brain,

67
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,480
but like this one here, it's my favorite.

68
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,920
So machine learning comes to solve this kind of problems

69
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,080
to help you identify these kind of differences

70
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,320
without having to have a human eye to look at it.

71
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,280
So it's loosely based on how the human brain works.

72
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,720
It's to solve the problems without knowing specifically,

73
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,360
setting up ifs to know the answer for it,

74
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,480
or trying every possibility to know the answer for it,

75
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,600
and enable systems that improve over time.

76
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,440
So when you have a prediction on machine learning,

77
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,800
you have a confidence level of that prediction

78
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,280
is true or not, and I'm gonna show you later.

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,520
So at Google, we have five machine learning APIs

80
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,320
that's for vision, the vision one's for processing images.

81
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,520
The cloud video intelligence processing video

82
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,520
gives you timestamps on the video,

83
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,560
what was said, and that kind of stuff.

84
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,960
Cloud speech is similar to the video,

85
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,560
but it can do live also.

86
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,560
And cloud translation also, it does about a thousand pairs

87
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,640
of different languages to translate.

88
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,840
And cloud natural language that helps you identify

89
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,920
sentiment analysis, for instance,

90
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,440
on a given sentence that you give it.

91
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,440
So the cloud vision API,

92
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,760
that's the first one that I wanna talk.

93
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,480
I wanna talk about three.

94
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,880
It's for detecting images that are complex,

95
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,640
just with a REST API request,

96
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,680
and you can do label and write detection

97
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,800
would be saying, hey, this is an elephant,

98
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,800
this is gray, and that's gonna give you the tags

99
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,480
around the image to get the text out of an image

100
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,520
using OCR to detect logos that you have.

101
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,400
If there is a popular logo that you have around,

102
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,240
it's gonna detect and say, hey, there is a logo here.

103
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,160
Landmarks also detect for you.

104
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,560
You take a picture of a landmark

105
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,040
and you can detect where it is.

106
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,440
Crop hints is like what you do in Instagram.

107
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,960
It gives you a hint of how to crop the image to be square.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,720
And then explicit content detection,

109
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,560
because a lot of the content we get sometimes is from users

110
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,640
and we don't know what they are doing.

111
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,960
So instead of just showing you can't see

112
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,360
is this image safe, it's gonna tell you it is or not

113
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,080
with a confidence level.

114
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,320
So I have a demonstration here of the cloud vision API.

115
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,760
This first cell here, just ignore it,

116
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,200
is just to break it nicely, and I want your help here.

117
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,600
I hear I'm importing the cloud vision API

118
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,320
and then sending which file it is,

119
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,200
sending out the file URL and getting the image annotated

120
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,720
and showing up the image in the end.

121
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,280
So this is image.

122
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
Where it is?

123
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,620
Okay, Golden Gate Bridge.

124
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,920
So let's see, I'm executing, no.

125
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,220
It's the 25th of April Bridge in Lisbon, Portugal.

126
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,200
It's similar, but it's not same.

127
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,080
And you can do it with another one too.

128
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,560
Now you don't trust me anymore.

129
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,280
But like, what is this?

130
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,840
Okay, let's see.

131
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,060
No, it's a fire and hotel and casino.

132
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,360
So even images that are similar,

133
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,660
that looks like landmarks,

134
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,880
you're able to detect that's different.

135
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,640
So you can also get different labels around the image.

136
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,080
It says it's a landmark, it's a tower.

137
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,960
Tourism, because it's Las Vegas,

138
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,680
so it's involved with tourism and other tags.

139
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,360
And here I'm getting a random image

140
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,200
because we have this thing called web detection.

141
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,240
And you can say, hey, I want to see visually similar images

142
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,400
to the one that I just uploaded here.

143
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,640
This is useful if you're looking,

144
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,760
you can have full match images too.

145
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,800
If you're looking, let's say you took a picture

146
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,120
and you wanna see if someone in the web

147
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,440
got your picture copied on their blog

148
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,760
or something like that,

149
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,520
you can look for copyright infringement with this

150
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,920
to know if someone took the same picture as you

151
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,480
and put on their content.

152
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,680
So that's unused for that.

153
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,720
This one is to get visually similar,

154
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,860
not necessarily the same, and showing off here.

155
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,120
So it's executing, go internet.

156
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,340
And this is not the same image, but it's similar.

157
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,220
You see it's the same monument.

158
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,020
And I'm getting a random image.

159
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,760
And if I get it again,

160
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,880
it's another picture of the same thing.

161
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,600
So it's able to detect not only,

162
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,720
there is a landmark, which landmark it is,

163
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,360
and find similar images to it too.

164
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,220
There's also a cool thing called auto email

165
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,920
that I'm gonna talk in the end.

166
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,360
And if it is, if there's time, I'm gonna show it to you.

167
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,000
So the Google Cloud Vision, the code is near,

168
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,400
it's just this, it's 13 lines with comments.

169
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,040
And with that, you can put anywhere in your code

170
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,880
to just figure out what you're being uploaded,

171
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,560
or if it is a safe image, for instance, or not.

172
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,500
And in this case, getting a landmark.

173
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,960
The next one, oh, I'm sorry.

174
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,320
If you use Giphy, you probably use Cloud Vision,

175
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,880
you're not, don't realize.

176
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,320
And if you wanna read a bit more,

177
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,640
just look at their engineering blog.

178
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,560
They have a blog post saying

179
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,440
how to use Cloud Vision in production.

180
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,080
So when you search by sometimes,

181
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,560
there you probably are using a Cloud Vision API

182
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,440
to get that answer.

183
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,880
Second one, the Google Cloud Translation.

184
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,340
It translates over 100, actually 120 languages now,

185
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,880
and you can have 1,000 pairs or so more,

186
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,680
as I said before, of comparison.

187
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,060
And you can use to translate text

188
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,440
from one language to a target language,

189
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,600
or detect the language that a text is from.

190
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,880
Let's say you got a flyer, a post,

191
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,560
and you don't know what is written

192
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,040
and what language it is,

193
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,840
so someone sends you an email,

194
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,040
you don't know the language,

195
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:49,040
you can use the Vision API, the Translation API,

196
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,560
to detect which language is being said there.

197
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,480
So one of the examples that we have

198
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,760
is the Google Translate app,

199
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,880
and you can just show an image

200
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,760
and kind of combine the Vision,

201
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,520
get in the OCR, and translate whatever is in there

202
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,540
to another language, so you know.

203
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,400
I have a little demonstration here.

204
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,280
So this, I'm gonna just say something in Japanese,

205
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,800
which I don't know how to pronounce,

206
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,200
I'm not gonna try,

207
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,240
and I'm gonna target translate to English.

208
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,800
And once I say, after instantiating the client here,

209
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,360
once I say which is the text,

210
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,020
or what is the target language,

211
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,300
you'll notice I didn't say it is Japanese at the beginning,

212
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,660
it's gonna figure out that it's from Japanese to English.

213
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,140
And that's gonna be what it's written there.

214
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,260
And you can translate to any language that you want.

215
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,220
Just that, if it is possible,

216
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,780
we have a, on the website there is a list

217
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,240
of the languages that are possible to be translated.

218
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,260
So you can use this to translate any text that you have,

219
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,100
that user input that you got,

220
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,980
and you can get it in different languages,

221
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,980
especially if you're using a multi-language application.

222
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,420
So this is the code with comments and the print,

223
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,180
it's about 18 lines,

224
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,500
and that does the translation for you.

225
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,300
So you don't have to go to the Google Translate itself

226
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,700
to translate for you, you can just use the API.

227
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,260
And my favorite one is the natural language.

228
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,500
The natural language API helps you understand,

229
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,700
with a simple request, things like extract entities,

230
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,340
and entities here are not like entities on the web,

231
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,420
it's like, oh, I went to a restaurant and ordered sushi,

232
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,060
it's gonna say that restaurant is a local,

233
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,460
and sushi it's a food, and that's a type of entity.

234
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,100
And detect the sentiment on a sentence,

235
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,780
and when I was, I'm Brazilian,

236
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,780
so when I was learning Portuguese,

237
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,540
Portuguese is not an easy language,

238
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,540
it had like this thick book on analysis, syntax analysis,

239
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,220
and I could never get that thing figured out.

240
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,220
And with this API, you can actually get,

241
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,140
say, this is a verb, this is a conjunction,

242
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:16,140
this is adverb, and you can stop having to worry about that.

243
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,660
And in the end, classify content, but there is a caveat.

244
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,660
The classifying content API only works with English,

245
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,340
it doesn't work with other languages.

246
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,620
So, first off, I have the sentiment API here,

247
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,740
I just said I went to the restaurant and ordered sushi,

248
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,380
the food was really good.

249
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,100
Even though it was negative, the score,

250
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,740
it's still on the neutral zone,

251
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,100
because it's, I'm not saying anything bad about it,

252
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,460
it's just a bit, see, it's neutral.

253
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,340
But the overall score of the whole document,

254
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,500
it's positive, it's 0.3.

255
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,540
And the magnitude says, like, it's from zero to infinity,

256
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,140
it tells you how much intention and sentiment

257
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,900
is on that thing.

258
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,900
So, 0.9 is the whole overall magnitude of document.

259
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,180
The food was really good, I think,

260
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,700
because of the word good, is 0.8, it's a bit higher.

261
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,500
So, as I say, syntax analysis,

262
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,860
and analyzing that sentence that I just wrote before,

263
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,860
we can see how the words depend on each other.

264
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:27,020
So, you see here that root, the root word is go,

265
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,860
and that's the lemma, which means like,

266
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,940
it's like the main thing on a sentence,

267
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,900
and this case is go and order,

268
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,020
that's two things that you couldn't,

269
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,020
if you remove from the sentence, it doesn't make any sense.

270
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,460
And the food was really good,

271
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,020
it's the B for that,

272
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,080
and tells which word depends on each thing.

273
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,620
So, I would have totally cheated on my exams

274
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,620
if I had that before, but that's available for you too.

275
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,620
Content classification, as I said before,

276
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,500
it's only in English, but notice here,

277
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,940
I don't mention, it says it's baseball,

278
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,260
and I said before, I always have a confidence level

279
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,860
that says how much confident it is on the prediction.

280
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,140
You don't see baseball mentioned on the news there,

281
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,500
you just see some names of a team maybe,

282
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,340
and a player, but he knows that that player,

283
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,580
it's from a baseball team,

284
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,900
and that he has this probably with 99% chance,

285
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,740
it's a baseball article, so that's part of it.

286
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,700
I have a demonstration here to integrate the three APIs

287
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,280
that I showed you before.

288
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,940
So, I'm gonna get the Google Cloud Vision API,

289
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,400
and gonna import an image from our article,

290
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,640
translate it to English, detect,

291
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,080
and see what that article it's about.

292
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,640
So, if you know Portuguese,

293
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,720
you may know what this is about,

294
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,840
but if you don't know, you can figure it out.

295
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,320
So, I took a picture from the newspaper,

296
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,340
and I have this article here.

297
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,680
So, I'm gonna translate, let me execute this first one,

298
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,600
okay, I'm gonna translate, not translate,

299
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,920
I'm gonna get the OCR of that image.

300
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,720
So, notice that it came with the same break things,

301
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,900
break lines as the article came,

302
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,880
and it has all the text from there,

303
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,320
but when you translate, the break lines doesn't matter,

304
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,040
because I'm gonna tell you, it's not 100% accurate,

305
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,200
but it's good enough just to be able

306
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,720
to be used formally as a translation.

307
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,600
So, here it's a translation, and it does a translation

308
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,360
even though the text was not well formatted,

309
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,680
was able to do the translation,

310
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,880
and on the language classification,

311
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,520
it's gonna tell you what it is about,

312
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,600
and with 82.9%, it's about jobs and education

313
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,420
with regards to education.

314
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,360
So, the article actually was about SATs in Brazil,

315
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,760
how students were gonna take the SATs.

316
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,560
So, it is about education.

317
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,480
So, that's one of the demos.

318
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,560
And as I said before, if I had time,

319
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,040
I was going to talk about AutoML Vision.

320
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,640
So, AutoML, it's like, let's say you have,

321
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,840
this is all pre-trained models with Google data,

322
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,320
public data sites that we got from the internet.

323
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,240
But let's say you don't wanna use that,

324
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,360
you want to use your own data to classify content,

325
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,080
and if you use that, that data belongs to you,

326
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,760
it does not go to the Google's model, only for your model.

327
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,520
And in this case here, I wanted to train clouds.

328
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,120
And what best place to predict the clouds than the clouds?

329
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,440
There is no other place.

330
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,840
So, I wanted to predict clouds.

331
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,420
I know there is way more than five types of clouds,

332
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,000
but for simplification purposes, I only did five in here.

333
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,460
Yes, I only did five in here.

334
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,440
And once you do that, you can train your model

335
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,120
because you import the images as a upload,

336
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,880
you can upload from your computer.

337
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
If you have a bucket on Google Cloud Storage,

338
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,880
you say the CSV, you say the image URL and the label,

339
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,680
and you can import that.

340
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,640
And once you train your image, you can see here

341
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,640
the confusion matrix of how that thing performs.

342
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,180
And you can see that outer stars,

343
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,320
it's highly confused with cirrus and cumulus.

344
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,360
But here, the higher the volume on the diagonal,

345
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,300
the better model you have.

346
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,320
Probably the problem is with that,

347
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,360
it's because I don't have much outer stratus pictures.

348
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,840
I only have, you need at least 800 of each to train a model,

349
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,560
but I only had 135 and all the other ones I have over 400.

350
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,740
So, that's why it's confusing for the model.

351
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,040
And I took a picture, not here,

352
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,720
because I tried to take a picture outside

353
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,000
and there is no clouds outside.

354
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,600
So, I took a picture and I'm gonna show you the picture.

355
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,760
When my, where's my mouse?

356
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,440
So, this is a picture in Florida, which was nice.

357
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,840
And I'm gonna try to predict what type of cloud that is.

358
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,600
I'm not sure if the prediction is correct

359
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,560
because I'm not a cloud specialist.

360
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,720
I once was on a talk that the guy,

361
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,520
my guy was specifically a meteorologist

362
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,960
and he's like, your prediction is wrong.

363
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,000
I was like, I'm sorry.

364
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,600
But, let's try to predict it.

365
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,120
And there is a thing called, you need to warm up the model.

366
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,080
I hope the model is warmed up to predict.

367
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,200
Yeah, it is.

368
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,100
So, this image was not in my collection.

369
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,060
It's a picture that I took myself.

370
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,160
And with 97.3%, you can see that's a cirrus type.

371
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,640
And everything here is trying to sum to one in the end.

372
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,640
But like, it can have at most one as 100% confidence

373
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,560
but that's not always possible.

374
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,320
So, if a high confidence level,

375
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,320
you can see that's a cirrus type of cloud.

376
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,760
And with that, I'm gonna go with questions.

377
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
And that's it.

378
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,760
uz

379
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:36,280
Zap

380
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,680
Thank you for the great talk.

381
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,360
Is it possible to take out images

382
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,320
like, for example, in sign language,

383
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,920
images like train the using learning here?

384
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,840
Yes, so it was interesting that you said sign language

385
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,440
because one of the examples we have,

386
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,760
it's with sign languages, but one of the difficulties

387
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,200
is because I don't remember which letter

388
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,200
was really complicated to make and was hard to get images,

389
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,340
so we had this friend that,

390
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,320
I'm not the developer advocate

391
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,040
that usually does machine learning,

392
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,120
I do as a sidekick sometimes,

393
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,120
but she was training the model,

394
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,920
everybody had to learn a bit of sign language

395
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,280
to take pictures of her so she could train the model,

396
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,200
so yes, you can do that, but you need to have data,

397
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,560
that's the hardest part, you know.

398
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,520
If I did, I mean the signs and stuff?

399
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,400
You need to train the model, to train the model,

400
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,800
you need to have images and the label,

401
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,760
for sure that you know for sure that's right,

402
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,440
so you can train the model, so yes, it's possible,

403
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
without any code.

404
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,120
Okay.

405
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,360
Well, I have two questions.

406
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,760
Go ahead.

407
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,840
You mostly use Google Cloud,

408
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,560
so can you talk a few words about how easy it is

409
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,760
to set up something like this,

410
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,800
because it's something which I'm very busy

411
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,640
for the user who doesn't do it much.

412
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,760
How hard is this set up process?

413
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,840
It's really easy, because you need to go through,

414
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,440
if you use Google Cloud, you need to go through a project

415
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,720
and enable the API, because the API can't disable,

416
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,200
so enable the API, and then once it is enabled,

417
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,880
if you deploy inside Google Cloud,

418
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,200
you don't need to have credentials,

419
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,960
because you can set up, you can say,

420
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,480
if it is on the same project, you can say,

421
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,120
hey, it's the same project, it has access to these APIs,

422
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
but the problem is if you're doing local,

423
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,840
you need to create a service account,

424
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,040
and that's the hardest part,

425
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,040
and what you would do, extra step here,

426
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,840
would be on the, when you call the client here,

427
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,640
you would say, credential file,

428
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,640
and pass the file path to the code,

429
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,800
so that's the hardest part, it would be,

430
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,200
everything else is the same.

431
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,720
I have a question, a few questions, please.

432
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,600
So the classification, you said is only English right now?

433
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,440
Yes.

434
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,520
Are there any plans to expand that?

435
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,440
I don't know, I really don't know.

436
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,440
And then my second question is on classification.

437
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,080
You had categories in there,

438
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,800
is that something that you picked,

439
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,280
or does that come with the service?

440
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,360
It comes with the service.

441
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,800
You can actually, there is AutoML for natural language too,

442
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,080
so you can create, let's say you have tickets,

443
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,080
support tickets, and you wanna categorize

444
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,200
which category it is, and you wanna be able

445
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,760
to predict that kind of, for future tickets.

446
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,000
So if you know the label that it is currently,

447
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,160
you can train the model based on that,

448
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,720
and you get the category, not me,

449
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,600
and in the end have that predicting model for you.

450
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,960
Without code, again.

451
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,760
Any other questions?

452
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,720
Well, thanks.

453
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,560
Thank you.

454
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,400
Thank you.

455
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,240
Thank you.
