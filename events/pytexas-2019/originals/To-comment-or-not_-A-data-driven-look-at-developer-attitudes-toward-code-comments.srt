1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Perfect.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Wonderful.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to do

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
this talk, I conducted

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
a survey, so I want to do a quick straw

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
poll among us right here.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm wondering,

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
alright, testing

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
one, two, three.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You all hear me now?

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Cool.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Little too far

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
from the mouth there.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Alright, so I'm wondering, little

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
quick straw poll,

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
how many of us have made

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
a comment to

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
themselves as they were

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
working within their code base?

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
amazing! Okay, me too.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Not alone, thank goodness.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And there are lots of reasons to want to do this.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So, maybe you have

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
a variable that you're scared to change,

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
someone else's code.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Do I know exactly what that variable

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
is doing? I'm not sure.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Maybe you just copy-pasted a section of

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
code from online, and you want

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
to make a quick note? Yeah, I heard a yeah.

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We've all been there.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's even easier to

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
forget what the code does when you

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
didn't write it, as it turns out.

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And maybe you made a choice

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that you want to make sure that

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
the future you knows about.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Because, you know, past you

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
makes choices, and future you just

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
whew, it's hard.

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So,

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
since we're all on the same page,

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and we've all worked on these comments,

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
we've come to the right place. We're going to

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
dive into code

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
comments. So, with all these

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
reasons to add comments, and all these hands

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
going up in the room, we might wonder

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
why we aren't making these

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
inline code comments

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
all over the place.

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Come on slide, please.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thank you.

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Alright, so we're going to do a

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
quick critique

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
of two comments

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I am shamefully

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
sharing with you today.

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, what happens when someone who is using

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
learning to use comments, and commenting

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to hold their place,

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and relieve some of this cognitive

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
load that they're going through in their learning

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
as they change direction, look up turns,

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
find code samples.

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So, in this first example,

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
what do we think?

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The tutorial that I used

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
to start the project is

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
cited at the top.

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Anybody find that reasonable?

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's okay to do that? Do a show

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
of hands?

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay, a couple people think that's okay. We've got

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
skeptics in the room.

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, yep,

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I hear you. Okay, well I'll tell you

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
what's going on up there. What's going on

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
up there is there is some code,

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and then there's a line at the top that says

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I took this code from this lovely

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
tutorial, and it is turning

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
into this project. This is what I contributed,

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and what came from the tutorial.

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Because I'm an academic,

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and I love citing things.

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So, that's what would be on that

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
screen if my color were

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
a little less off.

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So, for most of us, that comment might

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
survive in a code base, and eventually

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
be added to documentation as the project

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
goes. And in this second,

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
hopefully with even better color,

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
we see this person

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
was trying

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
to use beautiful

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
soup to

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
scrape a website, and

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
send an alert when her favorite on-campus

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
climbing wall was open.

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And you see there's this little

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
little, oh boy,

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
badly colored green square

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
that would say open if we could see it.

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But, you know,

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
our hero has not used beautiful

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
soup before, and the notes

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
that she made to herself

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
lists not

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
only what she should

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
be doing, her own little

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
to-do list,

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
but it also has code that is

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
commented out. It probably

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
doesn't work.

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And notes

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
expressing her confusion,

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
including my favorite comment to date.

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, it's a list.

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Thank God.

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So, would you want to

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
contribute to a code base

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
that had similar pileups

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
of comments throughout?

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Honestly, I,

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
when I was pulling out this example,

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
more, even

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
more experienced me, felt confused

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
just looking at this.

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
If this was file after file,

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I think I'd run in the other direction.

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Y'all with me on

138
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
this one? Yeah.

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So, before

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
we dive in and we talk more about comments,

141
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
what makes

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
a good programmer?

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We need to know

144
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
languages,

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
methods, there's some

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
amount of knowledge that we need to have.

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We need to have the ability

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
to apply our

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
problem-solving and creative thinking

150
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
skills, and

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
last, but

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
definitely not least, we need to be

153
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
able to communicate and, let's face

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
it, write usable

155
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
code.

156
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So, we spend a lot of time

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
in our industry

158
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
talking about that first point,

159
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
knowing a language and methods,

160
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
but I want

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
to talk about the journey

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
that I took through the other two,

163
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
that creative thinking and communicating,

164
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
since they're

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
an important part of the mastery

166
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
we all desire.

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So.

168
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Relatable.

169
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So,

170
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
documentation is what

171
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
allows the code to be used,

172
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
expanded, adapted,

173
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and for a community to be formed.

174
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Avoid causing

175
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
other programmers pain.

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So,

177
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
as I was approaching

178
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
my own comments

179
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
as docs strategy,

180
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I tried to see what other

181
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
people were using comments for,

182
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and I found a couple of different uses.

183
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You can have comments at the top

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
of a file as a summary.

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Not all of us use GitHub.

186
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Any other academics in the room?

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
A few? Okay, cool.

188
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's where I come from too. We have these

189
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
nice little things at the top, and it

190
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
tells you the email address of who

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
you should message if it's all

192
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
messed up. And,

193
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
yeah. Everybody

194
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
loves having corresponding authors.

195
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So, they have comments

196
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
to describe functions.

197
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And then, you want

198
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
to be able to

199
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
maybe clarify any

200
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
tricky situations you had to

201
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
go through

202
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
when you were writing the code.

203
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So, this will allow you to

204
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
later

205
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
be able to create your own standalone

206
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
docs, in part

207
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
using these comments.

208
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
For folks like me,

209
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
who are

210
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
very visual and enjoy

211
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and, you know,

212
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
benefit from having all of their work in

213
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
front of them, it also could serve

214
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
as a notepad, so to speak.

215
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And, as many

216
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
blogs helpfully

217
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
or unhelpfully point out, it's important

218
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
to tell why

219
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
you're making a certain decision,

220
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
but your code, hopefully,

221
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
tells you how.

222
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So, there's some

223
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
confusion

224
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
about comments.

225
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
A lot

226
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
of people think that

227
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
no comment

228
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
is bad code.

229
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But,

230
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
maybe this is also true.

231
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Maybe

232
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
you're worried about the balance. I'm sorry,

233
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I think this will be hard to see.

234
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You want helpful comments,

235
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
but not distracting

236
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
helpful comments, but not distracting ones.

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And, it's possible, like this

238
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
comment claims, that

239
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
the kind of

240
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
hazing around figuring out

241
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
when a

242
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
comment is helpful documentation

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and when a comment is

244
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
fluff and should be avoided

245
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
is a bit of hazing that

246
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
we all have to go through as we learn

247
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
what the

248
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
proper balance is.

249
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That doesn't sound like

250
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
very much fun.

251
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So,

252
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
we debate.

253
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So, we hear about comment rot.

254
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But,

255
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
it's easy

256
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
to forget that learners

257
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
are people

258
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
our comments might be helping.

259
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And, that you're not going to be able

260
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
to decide how many comments

261
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
or what kind of comments

262
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
are helpful until you've worked within

263
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
code bases that use them

264
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and

265
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
been able to see them

266
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
yourself. So, remember,

267
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
we're trying to create the most usable code

268
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
we can.

269
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If you're always having to go to source,

270
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
it's going to be

271
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
a very long day.

272
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So, I started looking and saying,

273
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
well, are there some things in all this debate

274
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
that we can agree on?

275
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And, there are some best practices

276
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
that we can get behind.

277
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We generally agree

278
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
docstrings

279
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
should have inputs,

280
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
outputs, explain the

281
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
transformation that's taking place.

282
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And, everyone will tell you

283
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
that outdated comments, that comment

284
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
rot, those are

285
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
dirty, filthy lies.

286
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We don't like those. They're terrible.

287
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And,

288
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
finally,

289
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
my favorite advice from the internet,

290
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
too much, how many

291
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
comments are too many comments?

292
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, too much is too much.

293
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Thank you.

294
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Thank you, internet folks.

295
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So, sometimes,

296
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
we can agree that the

297
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
code tells us how

298
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
while the comments

299
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
should tell us why.

300
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Some folks say,

301
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
keep things instead of dry,

302
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
wet, don't waste

303
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
everyone's time.

304
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And, that,

305
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
you know, if we put the further critique,

306
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
a line by line commenting

307
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
may indicate a lack of understanding.

308
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So, the difficulty

309
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
for many of us is that there's lots

310
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
of variation in what is considered

311
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
best practices for comments

312
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
as we've discussed.

313
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And, the explanation is clearly

314
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
enough. There's variation,

315
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
different languages,

316
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
different needs, different industries,

317
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and different styles

318
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
of learning.

319
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So,

320
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
companies create their style

321
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
guides and,

322
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
you know, decide whether or not we should

323
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
include doc strings, comments,

324
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
etc.

325
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But, we can all agree

326
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
no matter what we think about these guidelines

327
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
that comments, if used properly,

328
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
if we can ever figure out

329
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
what that means, are an invaluable

330
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
part of a code base.

331
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The thing to remember

332
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
here is that to

333
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
a beginner programmer,

334
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
comments can be magic.

335
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If you can go back and you can

336
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
remember the first time you realize,

337
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
wow, if I put this

338
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
nifty little hashtag,

339
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
the interpreter is going to ignore it,

340
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and I can put whatever

341
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I need there.

342
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Nobody, just me,

343
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
remembers that?

344
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Okay, okay, I see a few hands.

345
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Alright, well, I was excited. I felt just like this.

346
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I was like, oh boy,

347
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm going to use this all day.

348
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So, people

349
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
use this power differently,

350
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
but many of the new programmers

351
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
as I started

352
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
talking to folks and mentoring,

353
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
they'll start

354
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
throwing comments everywhere.

355
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I've seen comments for variables,

356
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
comments that hold questions

357
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
to ask a mentor later,

358
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
comments made during

359
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
pairing to record

360
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
some new

361
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
related bit of knowledge

362
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
that people are still putting their heads around,

363
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
comments used as an

364
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
outline for code yet to be written,

365
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and

366
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
for the, you know,

367
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
code hoarders among us,

368
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
comments holding code that we

369
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
don't use anymore, but we aren't

370
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
quite ready to get rid of yet.

371
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Even one person added

372
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
comments that record the

373
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
URL of the website

374
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
where they had found

375
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
some insight, they had stack overflowed,

376
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
done that copy-pasta thing,

377
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and it wasn't theirs,

378
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
so they wanted to, like,

379
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
show what they had done and not.

380
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Okay.

381
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So, there is

382
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
a lot of different ways

383
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
that these folks found to use comments.

384
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Really ingenious.

385
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And there's one

386
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
thing

387
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
as we are

388
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
pushing folks to

389
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
do, to be

390
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
dry and to do things the right way

391
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
at a time when,

392
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
as newer programmers, they're taking

393
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
on

394
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
probably more than they can.

395
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
There's one thing that we forget.

396
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't really know

397
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
WTF I've done

398
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
tonight.

399
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I committed a lot of stuff to get.

400
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Something,

401
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
something JavaScript.

402
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You all

403
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
know this?

404
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't know. Go back

405
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
to your commit messages when you're coding

406
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
too late. You'll see this person come out.

407
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You may think that you

408
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
aren't this person, but you've definitely

409
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
been this person. And we

410
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
tend to forget that

411
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
this person

412
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
needs aids and

413
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
resources and

414
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
the ability maybe

415
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
to use comments however

416
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
they need to use comments.

417
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So,

418
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
as I was

419
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
progressing through this stage,

420
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and I spent a while being this person

421
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
because I jumped around a lot.

422
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I became active in several programming

423
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
communities

424
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and I started to see a trend.

425
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Good code

426
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
is dry.

427
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So,

428
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
if you go online

429
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
and you say, okay,

430
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
so I've started

431
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
learning how to comment and I want, I'm a

432
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
new programmer and I want to be the best

433
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
programmer I can. So I'm

434
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
going to find out the best practices

435
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
and do it the best way all the time

436
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and I'll put that on top of everything else I'm

437
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
learning. You're going to hear,

438
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
if your code has too many comments, you need to

439
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
refactor. You're going to hear the very

440
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
helpful, you should just code better.

441
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
No, no, this is

442
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
real. I went and I searched and

443
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
this was advice that I got. You should code

444
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
better.

445
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You should not use comments.

446
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Why are they there in the first place?

447
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You should only use like

448
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
the correct comments and you should know the

449
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
difference.

450
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And only your code matters.

451
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Now, if you're me

452
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
or you're someone else who is

453
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
diving deep and trying to

454
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
find the best way to do something,

455
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
what you're actually going to hear is

456
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
so the way you're

457
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
learning is an anti-

458
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
panic. I don't know

459
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
how that feels, but

460
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
okay, it doesn't

461
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
feel very good.

462
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Y'all are less emotional about this than I

463
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
am.

464
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
All right,

465
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
so I

466
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
went to Stack Overflow and

467
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
there were too many things.

468
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I could have made a montage,

469
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
but instead

470
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm just going to show you, and it's

471
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
hard to read, this person has written

472
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
a very thoughtful, hey,

473
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm just learning how to do

474
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
this and I want to be able to document my

475
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
code properly.

476
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And, you know, on and on

477
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and they're like, I hear this and I hear

478
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
that. Can someone give me

479
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
guidance? Can someone

480
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
tell me what to do? And you know what

481
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
the person says? This has

482
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
been beaten

483
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
to death. Why are you

484
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
here? And they got a lot of upvotes.

485
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Can you imagine

486
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
a jerk on Stack Overflow

487
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
getting a lot of upvotes?

488
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So,

489
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't want to pick on this one

490
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
jerk, because there's a lot of them.

491
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But this was

492
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
continuous as I looked

493
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and it was also continuous in the forums

494
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
that I was in. So I started to

495
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
ask myself, what's going on here?

496
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Or is this like,

497
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
you know, kind of a

498
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
beginner-beginner and then

499
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
a slightly more advanced beginner, like looks

500
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
down on the beginner-beginner and says like,

501
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
shouldn't do it that way.

502
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Like, or

503
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
is there something

504
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
more we need to address

505
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
as a community?

506
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm a scientist.

507
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
There are a few things in the world I love

508
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
as much as data.

509
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And so I asked Twitter a question.

510
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And I got a whole nine

511
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
respondents.

512
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Do you know how not statistically

513
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
significant nine respondents

514
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
is? But I asked,

515
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
hey Twitter,

516
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
have you

517
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
always been dry or

518
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
is that something you came up with

519
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
as you progressed as a programmer?

520
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And Twitter,

521
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
well,

522
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I got nine respondents.

523
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And

524
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
they were split almost right down

525
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
the middle. If I'd gotten a tenth, it probably

526
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
would have been right down the middle.

527
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And I was a little

528
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
irked that so many people said

529
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
they were dry from day one because who

530
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
is?

531
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And that really surprised me and I said,

532
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
wow, I need to look at this more.

533
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And so

534
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I went to places that were not

535
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Twitter.

536
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And I, thank you.

537
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Thank you. I needed that.

538
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And definitely when I started this project,

539
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I definitely needed that.

540
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So I read a little bit

541
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
about survey design.

542
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And I set out into the world

543
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
of how do humans think?

544
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And I made myself a survey.

545
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So I asked a lot of questions.

546
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I said,

547
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
when

548
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
do you use comments?

549
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What causes you to use them?

550
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
When do you add them?

551
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Are we all secretly

552
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
taking out our shameful comments

553
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
before we add them to GitHub?

554
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Okay, I needed to get down to the bottom

555
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
of this. I saw a couple of nods.

556
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's not just me. Okay.

557
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So I

558
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
asked, and then I asked a little

559
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
bit more about people's

560
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
attitudes towards commenting in general.

561
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Tell me how you feel

562
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
about comments, I said.

563
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And what was wonderful,

564
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
in addition to the

565
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
multiple

566
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
choice and scale responses

567
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
that I got,

568
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
is people,

569
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
you know,

570
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I gave them a space to write about

571
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
how their commenting had changed over time.

572
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Or to write after each

573
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
question. And they wrote.

574
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm going to talk through

575
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and summarize as we go along, because

576
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I made the mistake later of putting too many

577
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
words on slides,

578
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
as one does.

579
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And so, I'll

580
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
share those results with you.

581
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So, what

582
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
best describes your current

583
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
or recent use of

584
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
comments?

585
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Do you comment when you're not certain?

586
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Do you comment each function

587
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
as a matter of practice?

588
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Do you use inline comments?

589
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Or do you comment out unused

590
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
code, shamefully?

591
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And I expected,

592
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
because I had

593
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
so many dry folks on Twitter,

594
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I expected,

595
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I did not expect

596
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
so many people to say,

597
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
yes, I use inline comments.

598
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Ninety, let's see,

599
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
what percentage is that?

600
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It got cut off. Fifty-something percent.

601
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I didn't expect

602
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
that at all.

603
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And people said some words.

604
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
My favorite comment was someone said,

605
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
as a child.

606
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And

607
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
one really neat

608
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
thing about this survey,

609
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and I want to dive into this data more,

610
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
so there will be

611
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
more chatter about this data, and at

612
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
some point it's going to be on GitHub, and we'll all

613
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
get to play with it.

614
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But I had survey respondents who

615
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
had been coding as little as one

616
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
month, and as long

617
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
as 35.

618
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And I was,

619
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
and it's a really nice

620
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
spread. And I'm

621
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
really glad that I

622
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
put in the effort to

623
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
cast such a wide net.

624
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And that people responded and really had

625
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
strong feelings about comments

626
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
that went on for paragraphs

627
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and talked about their childhood commenting.

628
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And how they've

629
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
grown up since then.

630
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And in my heart, I really want to

631
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
know if this person was truly a child

632
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
when they learned to program.

633
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Or if they're talking about their

634
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
childhood programmer self.

635
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Which is how I talk about myself

636
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
from, you know, four years ago.

637
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So some folks

638
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
said I

639
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
comment unused code.

640
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Comments

641
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
clutter code.

642
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So we've got a non-comment

643
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
person in the room.

644
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And

645
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
it goes on.

646
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So I asked, when do you add

647
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
comments? Because remember I had that

648
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
long list of

649
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
reasons for comments

650
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
earlier that

651
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
my newbie buddies were using.

652
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So I said, how about

653
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
scoping? Do you have a to-do list

654
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
in your comments?

655
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Does

656
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
it help you experiment?

657
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Do you add them as you're

658
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
completing a program?

659
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And a surprising number of people

660
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
said, yes, it does help me

661
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
experiment. I'll start writing

662
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
a piece of code. And

663
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm not sure if it's what I'm going to keep.

664
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And I commented

665
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
heavily. I see

666
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
what works and what doesn't.

667
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And I know right back where to go to.

668
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So more folks are using

669
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
that cognitive

670
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
code, you know, comments

671
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
as their little cognitive

672
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
storage bins

673
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
than I expected.

674
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And there are more words.

675
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I didn't

676
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
write comments as much

677
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
as when I started off, because

678
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I wasn't confident

679
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
that what I would say would be useful.

680
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Some folks are literally scared

681
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
of the prose element of

682
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
commenting. It's comfortable

683
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
to write code.

684
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Writing code is what we

685
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
value.

686
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But the act

687
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
of commenting is almost

688
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
more vulnerable. You are writing

689
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
documentation.

690
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You are explaining yourself.

691
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It is difficult.

692
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
You have to...

693
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
If you have pulled

694
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
something offline that you don't

695
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
quite understand, it's

696
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
sometimes hard to say

697
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
so.

698
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And so I had

699
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
asked a series of questions

700
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
that said, how positively do we

701
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
feel about comments?

702
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And

703
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
one is disagree, and

704
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
ten is strong agree.

705
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So a whole lot of folks

706
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
say,

707
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
comments help me remember what my code

708
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
does.

709
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
We see a similar distribution

710
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
for comments help me clarify

711
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
my thinking, a little more spread

712
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
out, a little whiter tail.

713
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And then we

714
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
get to, comments

715
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
help me learn.

716
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And I'm interested

717
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
to see here what the

718
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
distribution is for

719
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
how many of these folks have just been

720
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
programming so long that that's

721
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
not the aid that they use anymore.

722
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And it's possible

723
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
that there are a whole lot

724
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
fewer newbie

725
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
programmers who are using

726
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
comments in the way I

727
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
and some of the people I've mentored

728
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
have been. So that will be an

729
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
interesting thing to look at in the future.

730
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
We almost

731
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
all agree, comments, you know,

732
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
the good ones, will save

733
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
current and future developers

734
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
time.

735
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
We disagree

736
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
that comments

737
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
are helpful to you,

738
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
but should be removed

739
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
from GitHub. So all those folks who earlier

740
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
said that they take out their comments

741
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
before going to GitHub, you're good.

742
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Go ahead and add those in. You can show the world.

743
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It's fine.

744
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
But interestingly,

745
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
when I started

746
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
talking

747
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
about clutter

748
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and what was acceptable and not,

749
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
my distribution

750
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
wasn't quite so clear anymore. That's

751
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
a pretty wide tale considering what we

752
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
were seeing before.

753
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And when I get to

754
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
clear code is self-documenting

755
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and doesn't need comments,

756
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
we're a lot flatter.

757
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So it's clear that

758
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
despite all this positivity

759
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
towards comments among my respondents,

760
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
we're actually still,

761
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
we've really internalized

762
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
this idea that

763
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
good code is going to be so

764
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
clear that you don't need

765
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
the words.

766
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So

767
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
let's think about

768
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
what makes a good comment. And I'm so sorry

769
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
about what you're seeing right there.

770
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So what this person did

771
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
is they're describing the state

772
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
of their program

773
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
in a comment. Like they have a diagram

774
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
and they say, you are here

775
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
at this point.

776
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And I thought that was genius

777
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
because guess what?

778
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Sometimes it's really hard to visualize

779
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
what your code is

780
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
doing at that moment.

781
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Some folks

782
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
will create a whole man page to describe

783
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
a section of their codes.

784
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And it's possible

785
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
that right now those obvious comments

786
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
aren't so obvious to you.

787
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And as you get better

788
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
at naming conventions,

789
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
you won't want to put post-its

790
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
on all of your cats.

791
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And in the spirit of this

792
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
quote, the best comments

793
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
are a huge help.

794
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
But the perfect comments

795
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
are not going to come

796
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
without trial and error.

797
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So what can we do?

798
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
A lot of us

799
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
are really experienced.

800
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
We're probably mentoring.

801
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
We're probably talking to folks

802
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
who are figuring things out.

803
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So our end goal

804
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
is to support learners

805
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
where they're at.

806
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You want to praise the accomplishments.

807
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And instead

808
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
of saying, hey, it has to be dry,

809
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
you might say,

810
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
you know, I see what you're doing

811
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
there. It's ingenious

812
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
that you're using ASCII to show the

813
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
state of your game engine.

814
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
But

815
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
someday

816
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
you're going to get to the point

817
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
where you don't need that anymore.

818
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So you've got to remember your

819
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
overwhelmed learner,

820
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
why advise them where they're at,

821
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and you might want to suggest

822
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
a deep dive or

823
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
reading other folks' code.

824
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
If we rethink

825
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
comments, the thing

826
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I kept coming back to is if we were to

827
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
think about what comments were again

828
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
and we said, what if comments

829
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
are docs? Would we be having

830
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
another conversation?

831
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So

832
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I want to thank each of you

833
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
for coming. You've been lovely.

834
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I appreciate your participation especially.

835
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So thanks

836
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
to Pi Texas and thanks for all the folks

837
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
who told me their comment stories.

838
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I would appreciate if everyone

839
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
in this room

840
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
do not take this survey because we talked

841
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
about some results and you know what that

842
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
does, right?

843
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So don't do that. But if you

844
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
want to social media that thing,

845
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
my handle is there and whatnot.

846
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And I'd love to

847
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
be able to hear from

848
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
you know,

849
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
more folks about

850
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
their common experiences.

851
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So thank you very much.
