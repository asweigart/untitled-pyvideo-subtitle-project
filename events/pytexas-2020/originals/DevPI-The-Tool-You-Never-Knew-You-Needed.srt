00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,120
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,800
My name is Moshe Zadka.

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,440
My website is Cobodism.com, and today I want to talk to you about DevPI, the tool you never

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,000
knew you needed.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,480
I do want to start with an acknowledgement of country.

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,920
I live in the San Francisco Bay Area.

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,880
It is the ancestral homeland of the Muweka Ohlone people, and much of the story that

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:43,360
I'm going to talk to you about happens at Camp Twanga, which is the ancestral homeland

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,720
of the Central Sierra Miwok people.

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,440
And as I already spoiled, the story starts at Camp Twanga.

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,920
Camp Twanga is a beautiful, beautiful summer camp.

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,760
And after the summer is done, for families with kids who are a little bit too young to

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,240
go to summer camp on their own, they have what they call family summer camp during the

14
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,320
school year on some weekends.

15
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,320
And that's great.

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,200
You get, as you can see in the picture, to go on this beautiful lake with your kids on

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,240
the paddle boat.

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,260
The kids absolutely love it.

19
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,340
But there's one thing that's even better than that, which is, as you can see in the pictures

20
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:33,660
on the bottom, for some part of the time, the kids all hang out by themselves doing

21
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:39,020
fun things that one would do in a summer camp with the camp counselors.

22
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,740
And we, the parents, have time to ourselves to do whatever we want.

23
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,060
And especially at that time, my kids were a bit young.

24
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,860
I didn't have a lot of free time for myself during the weekend.

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,700
And this seemed like, oh, what am I going to do with all that time?

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,300
This is great.

27
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:06,900
So as one would, I decided I'm going to work on some personal stuff, like every normal

28
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,900
person.

29
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,900
Great.

30
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,380
So there's only one problem with that.

31
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,140
Camp Twanga doesn't have Wi-Fi.

32
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,300
In fact, it doesn't even have wired internet.

33
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,060
And it's kind of in the middle of Yosemite Park, which, to anyone who's ever visited

34
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:34,700
there, you would know that it does not have any cellular connectivity.

35
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,900
So no internet.

36
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,100
No connection with the outside world, which is actually great to kind of work on stuff

37
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,600
without interruptions.

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,220
But the best thing about working in Python, I do, and I'm sure many of you do, is that

39
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,060
you get to use the awesome PyPI.

40
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,220
You get so many packages.

41
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,900
I don't remember how many packages were there.

42
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,900
A few hundred thousand.

43
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,220
I haven't checked lately about how many packages are now probably over a million, but I haven't

44
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,860
checked recently.

45
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,860
A lot.

46
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,860
A lot is a good approximation.

47
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,860
Right?

48
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,660
And like, you know, the packages, right?

49
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,340
So I'm like, okay, I'm going to need some local package cache.

50
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:23,620
And for many months now at that point, I resisted installing their PyPi.

51
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,620
Why would I even need it?

52
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,900
I'll always have internet.

53
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,980
But you know, the best day plans.

54
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,900
And I was going to not have internet.

55
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:40,580
And finally, my friends broke me down, and I'm like, fine, I'll install PyPI.

56
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,020
So it's pretty easy.

57
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:50,260
I created a virtual environment dedicated for that, as I do for most of the things I care about.

58
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,260
This virtual environment is pretty cheap.

59
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,300
I created a virtual environment called the PyPI.

60
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,660
I installed it.

61
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,260
I started the server.

62
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,540
That's pretty much it.

63
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,180
Now, if you look at the official documentation, you can see how to integrate the system.

64
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:13,780
This is a modern laptop in, you know, this was in 2017, 2018.

65
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:20,380
It's a modern laptop in kind of like modern times.

66
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,380
I pretty much never restarted.

67
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,660
I always hibernate it and hibernate it off.

68
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,700
If I have it running in some time, it's actually pretty convenient.

69
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,540
You can see the log file.

70
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,540
I'll minimize it.

71
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:40,180
If I don't see it in the window, pretty straightforward, no need to background, all kinds of complicated

72
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,180
demon manipulation.

73
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,180
I have a server up.

74
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,180
That's it.

75
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,700
But I'm a very suspicious man.

76
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,460
I don't trust things very easily.

77
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,300
Definitely not new things that I've never experienced before.

78
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,060
I wasn't going to trust it with, like, you know, how I'm going to work without internet.

79
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,460
I wanted to kind of ramp up the trust slowly.

80
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:15,420
So, the first thing I did was, okay, I'm going to install just a couple of packages.

81
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:22,620
This is a default index it generates when you just write it up, put slash PyPI, simple.

82
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:29,020
So I install, a couple of random packages, play with them just to see that they got downloaded

83
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,220
correctly, that I don't get weird import errors, like, what the hell did you try to download,

84
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,500
like a broken package with just the headers or just the metadata, whatever.

85
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:47,780
It works, right, once, right, that's definitely not enough evidence to say it's going to work

86
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,780
again.

87
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,780
Right?

88
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,860
So, you know, cautious optimism.

89
00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:02,940
And in the spirit of cautious optimism, my next step, I'm going to make it temporarily.

90
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:10,340
So in a terminal, I'm going to export the environment variable.

91
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:16,780
Now every time you type in this terminal, it's going to use the API if for some reason

92
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,780
it doesn't work.

93
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,140
You can just literally just access the shell, and I'm good to go.

94
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:27,900
This is great, right, and everything is awesome, and, you know, like, I try to play with it

95
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,820
a bunch of times, right, but now it's the default, right, so everything I run under

96
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:38,340
that is going to use that environment variable, that's my main development terminal, so, you

97
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,460
know, like, I would see if it's causing a problem, and, you know, like, after a few

98
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:49,900
days, if it doesn't cause a problem, I decide, like, it's time to make a firm commitment.

99
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:56,340
So and by firm commitment, I mean, let's put it in the pip.conf.

100
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:03,860
Now, like many of you, I'm sure, I didn't have a pip.conf before that works pretty well

101
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,860
without any configuration.

102
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:11,660
It grabs the package, installs it, everything works, right, but, you know, you see, to direct

103
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,180
it to the FBI, you don't need to configure it.

104
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,460
Pretty easy, right, I probably did it with V.I., not with cat, but you literally could

105
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,460
copy paste that command and it would work, right?

106
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,700
Simple, easy, now I don't have to think about it, I can close the terminal, I can, you

107
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,740
know, create new terminals and whatever, run shells, new shells, old shells, whatever,

108
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:43,740
and everything works, and, again, you know, this all helps, you know, packages get downloaded.

109
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,660
But do I really trust it, right, like, you know, like, how much packages am I going to

110
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,220
download every day, right?

111
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:58,060
Am I going to download everything I need before I go out of network range and I'll have nothing?

112
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,140
So, kind of scary, right, better, better prepare.

113
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:11,300
So, I did what any normal person would do, I ran talks, right, I, you know, here's an

114
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:17,340
example of running talks in Twisted, I don't even care if it succeeds, right, all I care

115
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,820
is that it kind of goes and builds all the virtual environments with all the packages

116
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:27,980
it gets from PyPI, right, and, you know, you care about other things, anyway, you have

117
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:33,380
to get to be able to work, it's out of network range, run talks, talks, talks, talks, talks,

118
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,060
a few more talks, and we're good to go, right, again, doesn't matter if it succeeds or fails,

119
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,540
all you need is just to download all the packages that you need, and, again, it doesn't matter

120
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,500
if you save them because all you want is to hit DevPI as hard as possible before you go

121
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,860
out of range so that it's going to get as much of the things you need day to day out

122
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,860
of PyPI.

123
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,540
So, this is great.

124
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:05,540
This works great, and, you know, I got to Camtowanga, I managed to actually do work,

125
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:13,540
I think I fixed a ticket in Twisted, it was a while ago, so I don't remember, it worked,

126
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:20,540
right, but I know what you're thinking, I'm giving this talk in 2020, hopefully it will

127
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,540
stay in YouTube for a while longer, so for the people in the future and for the people

128
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:33,540
in the present who need a reminder, there's a global pandemic going on, summer camps,

129
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:42,540
especially Camtowanga is something that leaves the Jewish philosophy of respecting life and

130
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:51,540
prioritizing saving lives shut down pretty fast during the pandemic, and, you know, like,

131
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,540
we're not going to see it open, at least in the near future, why am I even talking about

132
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,540
that?

133
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,540
Who cares?

134
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,540
We're all staying home, we have great networks, what does it matter?

135
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,540
I'm sure when the pandemic ends, maybe then we can learn about the API.

136
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,540
But that's not all the API can give you, right?

137
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:18,540
So, again, like, Camtowanga was like a crisis point, I had to install it, now I have it

138
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,540
running, let's figure out how I can use it to do more stuff.

139
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,540
So, turns out one of the cool things you can do is build yourself a little private area,

140
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:32,540
a little private API that you can use for all kinds of things.

141
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,540
Now, what can you use it?

142
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,540
Well, let's say that you have a package.

143
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,540
And let's say that's the last time you install the package, and I'm definitely not talking

144
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:50,540
about my embarrassment in my experience, this was definitely someone who is not me, let's

145
00:10:50,540 --> 00:11:05,540
call you Masha, who uploaded a package, and it was embarrassing for the other person who's

146
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,540
not me, and I want to make sure that I will never be embarrassed in that way.

147
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,540
Again, so, what do we do?

148
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,540
Well, we can do a test upload.

149
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:23,540
Sure, it does test API, but it's kind of annoying, and, for example, uploading the same package

150
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,540
again to test API will not work because it's like API, and you can't upload the same package

151
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,540
to API, right?

152
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,540
So, if you think you're going to make a mistake, and, again, I would never make a mistake,

153
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,540
but some other people might make a mistake.

154
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:41,540
You might, if you don't know how to avoid mistakes as well as me.

155
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,540
You know, you might need to upload the same package more than once until you get it right.

156
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,540
So, the API works great, right?

157
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,540
You don't even have to go outside, and you can tear it down, and you can build multiple.

158
00:11:53,540 --> 00:12:00,540
So, you know, here I'm building a little private area that beckons into the root API, which is

159
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,540
really important because what if your package has dependencies?

160
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,540
And, you know, your package has dependencies probably unless you're very, very, very careful

161
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:18,540
and, like, a bit focused on that, let's say.

162
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:25,540
So, let's first test it, like, you know, there's no package, right?

163
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,540
I haven't uploaded my package, and this is great, right?

164
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,540
Because this means that it doesn't exist on PyPI.

165
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:40,540
It doesn't exist in the private area, but that's great.

166
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,540
Just make sure that I actually remember to increase the version number.

167
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,540
And, again, I'm not saying I have ever made the mistake of forgetting to increase the version number,

168
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,540
but, you know, some other people who are definitely not me might have done that mistake.

169
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,540
So, easy to test it first.

170
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,540
Okay, but, you know, that's an easy test to do.

171
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,540
You could have done it with PyPI, so not a big deal.

172
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:08,540
But then I upload, you know, just like Twine, you know, obviously with a custom repo and a custom user

173
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:15,540
and a custom password, which doesn't have to be very secure because it's only a local host and who cares.

174
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:21,540
So, if you do want to care, you can, of course, do more secure things with the password.

175
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:28,540
And then, of course, when I try to pip install it, it didn't fail, it didn't succeed because I

176
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,540
forgot to put with me MD in the manifest.

177
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:38,540
I usually use with me RST, and I forget with me RST while it goes there by default.

178
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,540
With me MD does not.

179
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,540
This was a package that was not mandated by me.

180
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,540
And, yeah.

181
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,540
So, but, again, like, this is just between me and my computer, right?

182
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,540
Like, the world outside doesn't know that I made this, like, you know, snuffle.

183
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:04,540
So, I can, you know, keep face, let's say, in front of my friends and colleagues.

184
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:10,540
And real quick, you know, fix that, like, fix my manifest.in.

185
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,540
Upload it again.

186
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,540
Notice I can upload the same version again because it's just the PyPI.

187
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:22,540
You can mark something as you can't upload that again, but by default those test areas, you can just

188
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,540
reupload them, right?

189
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,540
They're not supposed to be, like, long-term persistent or have all these really good guarantees

190
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:36,540
that this PyPI would give you.

191
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,540
So, let's see if it works.

192
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,540
It works.

193
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,540
I can import.

194
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:56,540
And, you know, in real life, again, unless you've really gotten to great length to automate your

195
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,540
package creation and upload, you're probably going to make a few more mistakes.

196
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,540
That would be very fun.

197
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,540
It's pretty nice to be able to do those mistakes in private a few times.

198
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:12,540
And if you are automating the upload, you definitely want to make sure that while you're working on

199
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,540
automation, you're doing that, right?

200
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:23,540
So, regardless of which path you're going to take, this is a good way forward.

201
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,540
Now, let's say that you have a few packages that you all want to make sure all work together.

202
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,540
Sure, not ideal.

203
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,540
Ideal packages have.

204
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,540
But, you know, sometimes it happens.

205
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,540
Maybe you're not uploading to the real PyPI.

206
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,540
Maybe you're uploading them just to kind of your friend and colleague's internal proprietary package

207
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,540
or whatever.

208
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:49,540
Want to make sure that a bunch of these versions work together.

209
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,540
Then you can do that.

210
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,540
You can make an integration area.

211
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,540
And, again, upload from the current area to the integration area.

212
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,540
So, this is pretty cool, right?

213
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:05,540
You can kind of test a bunch of packages independently and then check if they integrate well.

214
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,540
So, this is pretty great, right?

215
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:12,540
You're, you know, again, like you still have to figure out some development workflow.

216
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:19,540
But now you have support for a lot of bits that you would need to support to get a good workflow.

217
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:25,540
And finally, one of the best things is so I started the talk while saying I'm installing the

218
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,540
PyPI on my laptop.

219
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,540
And my laptop, as always, is just a laptop.

220
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,540
You can, again, integrate with system CTL.

221
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,540
Actually run it on some server that runs on your cloud provider or whatever.

222
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,540
You can run Kubernetes with the right settings.

223
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,540
You have a bunch of options.

224
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,540
It doesn't matter, really.

225
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:54,540
At the end of the day, you can just run your PyPI and, you know, figure out some sort of usually your

226
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,540
usually you have any way of VPN.

227
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:01,540
If you don't want a VPN, you can always put it behind some username password proxy or whatever.

228
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,540
And you have a shared FPI.

229
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,540
And this is great, right?

230
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,540
Because now for the packages, again, you want to only share with your colleagues.

231
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,540
You have a FPI.

232
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,540
And you back end your local FPI to that FPI.

233
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,540
So, you don't have to configure PAP.

234
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:21,540
You don't have to, you know, make sure that every talk doesn't override the version of PAP.

235
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,540
It just works against your FPI.

236
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,540
And everything works great.

237
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:31,540
And if the AppStream ever changes, just change the AppStream, you don't have to worry about that.

238
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:40,540
So, this gives you a great area to share with your colleagues.

239
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:48,540
And while it doesn't scale to PyPI level and possibly doesn't scale if your company is on Microsoft or Facebook

240
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,540
or whatever, it scales for quite a while.

241
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:59,540
As long as it's just going to be one person managing that because that's all the engineering stuff your company can afford.

242
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,540
If I shared the FPI, the FPI would probably scale up to that level.

243
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,540
So, it scales pretty nicely.

244
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:16,540
And it will give you pretty much all you need to actually run like an engineering organization that is layered on top of Python.

245
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,540
Of course, that means you take it seriously, right?

246
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,540
This is your source of tools for packages.

247
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,540
You probably want to make sure you back up.

248
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,540
It's pretty easy to back up.

249
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,540
Again, it doesn't solve the backup problem for you, nor should it.

250
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,540
It's not a backup service.

251
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,540
What the FPI knows how to do is how to export the data to a consistent thing.

252
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:44,540
Then you can use whatever backup in general you use.

253
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:58,540
Be it some backup service or just tabling random things and sending off whatever solution you think is right for your scale and your needs and reliability constraints and so on.

254
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:03,540
But you start with exporting to the directory and then you figure out how to back up that directory.

255
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:15,540
And I hope that any of you who is in charge of some system that is somehow involved with backing up knows that you need to restore.

256
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:20,540
You need to do test restores every now and then.

257
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,540
Pretend like you have a crash.

258
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,540
Pretend you have to restore and see if it works.

259
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,540
So, that's how the restore.

260
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:36,540
The first step is taking whatever the S3 bucket or the crash pad or crash plan or whatever it is and dumping it into local directories.

261
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,540
Then you can import from that local directory and run the server again.

262
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,540
Then back into that server.

263
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:50,540
That's one of the nice things about having the ability to configure an app screen for the API.

264
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,540
And see that you could have worked this way.

265
00:19:54,540 --> 00:20:01,540
Regardless of the frequency and how involved your restore exercises are.

266
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,540
Frequency should be bigger than zero.

267
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:09,540
Whatever it is and however they're planned, this is a good support for that thing.

268
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:16,540
Again, the API itself is not a backup solution, but it will support your backup workflow.

269
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:22,540
So, with that, I want to leave you with some parking flow thoughts about that.

270
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:33,540
Whether you're out in the woods experimenting with some open source packages locally or working in a team, the API is a tool that you never needed.

271
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,540
Thank you very much for listening to my talk.

272
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,540
And I hope you have a great experience the rest of the conference.

273
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,540
Goodbye.

274
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,540
Thank you.
