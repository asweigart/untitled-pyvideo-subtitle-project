1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
All right, so this is a hot swap talk, so be prepared for it to kind of go all over

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,680
the place.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,640
So this is coding in the Mozart effect.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,640
My name is PJ.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,640
We already know that.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,640
I work at DevRelate.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,640
That's cool.

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,640
I'm not going to go through that.

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,640
A little bit about me.

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,720
I've been coding for over 20 years.

11
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,700
It is not always my main profession because I do a lot of DevRel stuff, but before that

12
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,160
I was a musician.

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,560
Before that I heavily studied music.

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,800
I've produced albums.

15
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
I've recorded albums.

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
I've toured.

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,280
I've done all of the music stuff that you think is really hot and sexy, and if you want

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,960
to have a conversation about why being a musician is none of those things, I'm happy to do that

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,280
after this talk.

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,820
I do have to give you a little bit of a warning.

21
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,820
I am extremely opinionated about music.

22
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,800
If we are going to have a conversation about music, that is going to come up.

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,220
I will get heated.

24
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,120
If you want to talk about who the best rapper is and you want to talk about how is Jay-Z,

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,960
I will explain to you why you are wrong.

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,040
You are entitled to your opinion, however, it is not correct.

27
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,720
Not too serious on that, but we can talk about it.

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,900
What is music?

29
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,720
One part of this definition is laid out by a guy named Don Campbell in his book The Mozart

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
Effect.

31
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,400
Don started to do research, and like any good scientist, he wanted to make sure his conclusions

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,600
were going to match with what he wanted to see.

33
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,400
He wanted to see expected results.

34
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,240
Don's main focus was to see how music affects the brain specifically.

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,960
A lot of times you see the idea of the Mozart Effect get kicked around, and there are very

36
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,920
specific reasons why it is called what it is called.

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,400
Don's main idea was that music could heal.

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,760
It is a little hippy-dippy, because he thought it would be better than modern medicine.

39
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,800
This is in the 60s and 70s, so bear with Don.

40
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,360
He was a child of his time.

41
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,080
He tried it out with Alzheimer's patients, and what he did was he thought he was seeing

42
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,280
what he expected, which was an increase in cognitive function and memory based on specific

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,040
pieces of music.

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,720
For non-brain maladies, though, Don was a little surprised.

45
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,560
What did Don play as his patients?

46
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,120
It is right in the title, Mozart.

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,800
The idea behind Don's work started with the homeopathic intention.

48
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,880
There is a great deal written about how music can heal.

49
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,960
This is not an original or different idea.

50
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,360
The focus on this talk, though, is not on trying to heal.

51
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,680
I am not a doctor.

52
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,000
I am somewhat of a scientist.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,280
I fancy myself a scientist, and I feel like after Laura's talk I can call myself a citizen

54
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
scientist.

55
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
I do not have a PhD.

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,800
I am not a doctor, but I am much cooler than that.

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,440
What was found over time, not just with Don, but with research that happened after that,

58
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,560
was that music can actually increase cognitive function.

59
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,520
How it works is a little bit different than he expected.

60
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,760
We are not curing diseases, but what we are doing is improving our cognition, which is

61
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
something that we want to do.

62
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,040
Our mental health is very important to us, right?

63
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,400
Don based his research on testing – see, testing is not just for devs – that he performed

64
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,600
with Dr. F. H. Rauscher – and I always read that right off the slide because I am pretty

65
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,720
sure I am always saying it wrong – and they started in the 60s and 70s making a lot of

66
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,680
working with mice in 1993, then chips, and then humans, and see if they could actually

67
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,840
perform tasks with better spatial reasoning.

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Do we know what spatial reasoning is?

69
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,080
Spatial reasoning is understanding that I am about two meters from this guy in the yellow

70
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
shirt.

71
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
More or less.

72
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,640
Maybe closer to three meters.

73
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,720
But I understand that that means four meters, okay.

74
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
So I am not that great.

75
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,920
I did not listen to any tunes this morning.

76
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,880
I did not play football.

77
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,320
I played baseball.

78
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,560
So I know that, though, he is that close.

79
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,480
The guy with the camera is a lot further away.

80
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,840
That is spatial reasoning.

81
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,800
Understanding where things are in relation to oneself.

82
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,240
There is a lot more to spatial reasoning than that, but that is where it began.

83
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,680
So they realized that if they played a specific piece by Mozart, the spatial IQ score of the

84
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,080
test subject would increase over time, as opposed to simply giving someone the test

85
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:16,560
instructions or giving them the test with no instructions and utter silence.

86
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
Just like that.

87
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,120
Can you imagine being put in front of a test or a piece of code?

88
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,640
No one explains to you how to do it.

89
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,560
They just put it in front of you and walk away.

90
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
No instructions.

91
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
That is it.

92
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
You are in a soundproof room.

93
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
What are you going to do?

94
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
You do not even really know what you are supposed to do.

95
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,600
So, of course, there is a little bit of control there.

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,880
So the research results were based on Mozart's piece.

97
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,760
It was a piece like F996 or something like that.

98
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,760
Very brief piece.

99
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,240
If I played it for you, you would all recognize it immediately.

100
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,440
The problem was they were focusing on the wide breadth of the test subjects, giving

101
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,600
them music or instructions or silence, but they all gave them the same piece of music.

102
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,360
What they found was what they were actually gaining was specific cognitive boosts that

103
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,360
only lasted temporarily.

104
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,720
So the things that I am going to tell you about are temporary cognitive boosts.

105
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,760
You cannot go home and listen to a piece by Mozart and be like, I am now a genius.

106
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,760
I am going to solve every problem I am ever going to see.

107
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,960
But what we found is a lot of people actually listen to music while they code.

108
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,680
I listen to music all the time.

109
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
I have an issue.

110
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,920
I do not know if it is an issue, but it is called, and I do not know how to say it, synesthesia?

111
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,360
How many people know what synesthesia is?

112
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,800
So what this means is when you hear music or sounds, you also see colors or have other

113
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,040
things that are attributed, you get smells.

114
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,520
So going to a concert for me is super exciting.

115
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,560
You might go and listen to this great band and you see lots of lights flashing all over

116
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
the place.

117
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
I am getting a very different experience.

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
I do not need the drugs.

119
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,240
I do not need them.

120
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,120
But all joking aside, so that is why I got so interested in this subject.

121
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,660
So the interesting thing to me is you can actually persist that IQ boost, that cognitive

122
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,860
boost over time by picking the right pieces.

123
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,700
So let me put this in English.

124
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,260
Music is a stimulator.

125
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,420
We all know that it can evoke emotions.

126
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,420
We know how it makes you feel.

127
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,460
But it can also move your brain in specific directions, especially when you are in a sluggish

128
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,340
slump or you are stuck on a piece of code.

129
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,540
A lot of people are like, sometimes when I code, I go and take a walk.

130
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,940
Well, a lot of times when I take a walk, I grab my headphones and I take a walk with

131
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,940
my headphones.

132
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,380
I actually cannot function without my headphones on most of the time.

133
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,780
I have music playing in my head constantly.

134
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,860
There are songs playing in my head right now.

135
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,380
And it is terrible because I do not get a choice.

136
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,380
It just picks it.

137
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,100
It is like having a broken iPod that you cannot get rid of and it never goes down on charge.

138
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,940
But the idea here is we all can relate to music.

139
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,500
Everybody knows the first song they listen to after their first breakup.

140
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,260
And even though that song might be a terrible emo song from the mid-90s, if you listen to

141
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:00,340
it now, you are like, oh, man, I feel sad.

142
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,700
What you do not know is your brain is like, hey, there is something specific going on

143
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,700
here.

144
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,780
Let me push you forward so you can better understand your situation as it relates to

145
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,740
what you are bringing in through your ears.

146
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,740
That is how the Mozart Effect works, essentially.

147
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,120
I have very much broken that down to a very simple level that we can all understand.

148
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,060
When it came to 1993 and Rauscher and all of his colleagues, they made the surprising

149
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:29,060
claim that specifically, and I got the numbers wrong, it was Mozart's Sonata for two pianos,

150
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,620
K448 for a specific duration of 10 minutes.

151
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,260
And what they found was their test subjects were originally, due to Don Campbell's research,

152
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,260
Alzheimer's patients, people with brain maladies.

153
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,900
But they had to have a control group, and for the control group, they used regular old

154
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,900
people.

155
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,540
They found whoever they could.

156
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,540
What is that?

157
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,020
Muggles, if you will.

158
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,420
Yes, they found muggles who did not have Alzheimer's and they said, let's listen.

159
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,420
And they were like, wait a minute, we are getting the same boost.

160
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,940
We are getting the same thing.

161
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,940
Why is that?

162
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,180
Well, the only signifying factor is K448.

163
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,060
It must be Mozart.

164
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,060
Mozart is the answer.

165
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,060
We have solved everyone's problems.

166
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,060
Thank you.

167
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,060
Good night.

168
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,740
Not quite.

169
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,420
What they really just found was that music can move people in different ways.

170
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,260
Harmonic music generally reduces dissonance in your brain.

171
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,660
It can establish more focus.

172
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,020
Instrumental music can allow a listener to kind of perform better.

173
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,460
So why do all this?

174
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,860
So at the heart, as coders, we really like doing things and we like translating things

175
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,860
into mathematics.

176
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,100
And the interesting thing about that is music is essentially mathematics expressed in a

177
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,600
different way.

178
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,940
If you are a classically trained musician, I am not.

179
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,740
I play by ear.

180
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,660
I play several different instruments, and I have never learned any of them.

181
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,620
But if you are a classically trained musician, you can look and see how many numbers are

182
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,620
involved.

183
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,620
Not just the time signature.

184
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,620
We all know the time signature.

185
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,620
Oh, this is 4-4.

186
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,620
Okay, cool.

187
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,620
How many people have seen the movie Whiplash?

188
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,900
First of all, everybody should see that movie.

189
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,380
It is trigger warning, super disturbing in some ways.

190
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,380
But they make references.

191
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,580
They are like, all right, bar 128, go, 1, 2, 3, 4.

192
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,620
And all of these musicians just pick up their instruments and play.

193
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,900
Because they understand through the numbers how the music works.

194
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,860
We as coders essentially are doing mathematics.

195
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,860
It is abstracted.

196
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,940
It is abstracted away.

197
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,780
You don't need to be a mathematician to be a coder anymore.

198
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:28,500
But it is in its essence, we are teaching computers to do the math that they know how

199
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
to do.

200
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,700
We are just using words and they translate it to binary.

201
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,060
There is a lot of level of abstraction between, but it is math.

202
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,060
We love math.

203
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,260
Computers love math.

204
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,260
Music loves math.

205
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,900
We are kind of bringing it all together.

206
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,840
So developers, mathematicians, scientists of every shape and size were not even an afterthought

207
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,780
for Rauscher and Campbell and their team of researchers.

208
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,060
They were not thinking about us.

209
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,620
They wanted to focus on epilepsy, Alzheimer's, ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, and other maladies

210
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,100
of the brain.

211
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,020
Once they started testing on a control group, though, they started to see that people without

212
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,860
brain issues found it just as stimulating as everyone else.

213
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,700
But why?

214
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,900
Was it this?

215
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,900
How can we figure that out?

216
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,460
So like good science, other scientists came in and said, all right, Rauscher and Campbell,

217
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,420
let's take a look at what you did.

218
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,860
Folks at Harvard and Oxford started to break it down.

219
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,260
What do you think they found out?

220
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,860
It wasn't Mozart.

221
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,860
There's hope for Joan Jett.

222
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,620
Now I wish I had a Joan Jett slide, damn.

223
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,100
It was about the emotional connection to the music.

224
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,340
This is how like if you see people with brain maladies when they're getting music therapy,

225
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,500
they often go through to select a song from their youth or something else that will evoke

226
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,620
an emotion that will trigger their brain to start remembering those associated with things.

227
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,460
A lot of us saw that commercial, I think it was like in the run up to the Super Bowl.

228
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,540
I think it was the Amazon Alexa had a commercial where it was a couple dancing and they said,

229
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,620
play our favorite song.

230
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,820
One of those people, the wife in that couple has Alzheimer's.

231
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,140
He continues to bring her memories back by playing that song.

232
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,140
It's a nice touch.

233
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,140
And then they sold things.

234
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,140
That made it all weird.

235
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,820
But the idea was it's the song that matters.

236
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,900
It's the connection to the song that matters, not the song itself.

237
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:21,340
So doesn't that kind of mean like essentially, can we just call it the Bieber effect?

238
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,340
Look at him.

239
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,620
Look at him.

240
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,340
I wish I had that hair.

241
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,860
I wish I had any hair.

242
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,340
But it's not untrue that if you have an emotional connection to a Justin Bieber or a Taylor

243
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,860
Swift song, you might actually get some kind of cognitive boost from that.

244
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,300
If you toss on Taylor Swift's red album while you're coding, you might be like, all right,

245
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,300
I'm about to jam this out.

246
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,460
I've got 38 minutes worth of, I don't know what Taylor Swift's about.

247
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,620
She breaks up with a lot of people, I guess.

248
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,620
I don't really know.

249
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,620
It's not my thing.

250
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,620
She's not good.

251
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,380
She doesn't write her own music.

252
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,300
But if that's your connection, then it could work for you.

253
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,740
So let's talk a little bit about that.

254
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,100
It's not really what's in the music.

255
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,300
It's what's in our brains.

256
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:12,340
The brain response to the senses, sight, tastes, feeling, smelling, hearing, sound, for those

257
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:18,540
of us who can hear and hear properly, that's one of our most powerful things.

258
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:24,620
Sound can provoke emotions in us, even if you're not a synesthetist like myself.

259
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,020
It will provoke things within you to generate memories.

260
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,420
Even if it's just like, oh, man, I remember the first time I heard Little Lion Man by

261
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,420
Mumford and Sons.

262
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,460
I was pulling up in my minivan in front of my house.

263
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,140
My son, who's now 21, was in the back seat and he's like, Dad, I like this song.

264
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,860
I'll remember that forever.

265
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,140
That's the emotional connection I have with that song.

266
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,260
It's coincidental, but it's always there.

267
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,260
I can picture it in my head.

268
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,740
I was like, yeah, my son gets good music.

269
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,140
We don't have to feed him crap music like a lot of parents do.

270
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,700
We're good parents.

271
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,100
But while working with deaf students, it was found that a similar effect could be achieved

272
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,560
using smell or sight.

273
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,060
So they don't have their hearing, but there's other cognitive boosts that they can get without

274
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,060
that sense.

275
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,180
So there's benefits there.

276
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,860
Smell, making bread, making pastries, things that are visually stimulating, great works

277
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,860
of art, brilliant video montages, or even music that is loud enough that they can feel

278
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,860
it.

279
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,180
They have found, can evoke similar cognitive things even in people who can't hear.

280
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,180
We're lucky.

281
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,980
I'm pretty sure everybody here can hear.

282
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,860
But it doesn't mean if you can't hear that you're completely knocked out of the game.

283
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,860
So you've heard of things like lumosity and stuff like that, and you focus on your mental

284
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,180
elasticity and cognitive improvement tools.

285
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,780
Incorporating music is kind of the same concept.

286
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,140
It's a little bit more based in science.

287
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,540
Lumosity is more on selling you the idea that you have this concept of mental elasticity,

288
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,340
which you do, but not the way they think you do.

289
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,980
It starts by seeing the short-term jumps.

290
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,980
Over time, you can increase and see more long-lasting cognitive benefits.

291
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:05,040
Technically, there's reason to believe you might even be able to see permanent results

292
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,040
by focusing on different ways to make your mind more elastic.

293
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,720
This also actually works with being more open-minded.

294
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,560
Having new experiences expands your mind and keeps you flowing, keeps you young, as they

295
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,560
say.

296
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:25,160
Being a coder is actually a lot less about the physical and more about the mental.

297
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,320
While the visible portion of what we do every day is like pounding a keyboard, being stimulated

298
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,960
by what's on the screen, all that stuff, the majority of what we do is actually cerebral.

299
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,160
This is part of the reason why I do the work with OSMI.

300
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,400
We have no problem being like, yo, my monitor is broken.

301
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
It doesn't work.

302
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Can I get a new one?

303
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Yo, my keyboard doesn't work.

304
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,920
For some reason, the escape key doesn't work because I got one of these MacBooks with a

305
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,160
stupid bar on top.

306
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,560
Can I get a new one?

307
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,520
Nobody goes, hey, so I have ADHD.

308
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
My brain doesn't work.

309
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
Can I get a new one?

310
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,600
First of all, no, you can't.

311
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,400
That is illegal and highly unethical.

312
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,520
But what you can do is talk to a counselor, and what they might suggest is music therapy.

313
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,000
Music therapy actually helps a lot with ADHD patients.

314
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,480
The reason why is because music allows you to bear down and focus.

315
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,760
It's important to keep in mind that when you start out, this cognitive boost is not going

316
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
to be permanent.

317
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
That was the case.

318
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,000
I've listened to enough music in my life to be one of the most intelligent people on the

319
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,160
planet.

320
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,280
Like I said, I listen to music nearly constantly.

321
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,520
I listen to music when I sleep.

322
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,240
I listen to music when I'm awake.

323
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,120
If I could have headphones in right now, I would.

324
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,240
I actually, I don't know, this is a thing that happened during the pandemic, but you

325
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
have a lot of Zoom meetings.

326
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,920
You generally take those Zoom meetings with headphones.

327
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
If you don't, everybody can hear everything that's going on in your house.

328
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
It's a terrible idea.

329
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Please use headphones.

330
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
I play music while I'm in meetings.

331
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,520
It helps me focus.

332
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,440
Just keep it on light in the background.

333
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,400
It doesn't have to be pounding and loud.

334
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,800
Light in the background, and it's coming through my headphones, so no one has to know.

335
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,380
Now the folks from Scout are like, wait a minute.

336
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,380
Have you ever been in a meeting we've been in and you've been listening to some shit?

337
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,380
Like, yeah, sorry.

338
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,380
But that's the way it goes.

339
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,380
It helps me to focus.

340
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,380
It helps me to work.

341
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,380
So the effect of music on your performance as a coder, at the beginning, will be short lived.

342
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,380
Not in the sense that you'll become like Charlie from Flowers.

343
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,380
Remember Flowers for Algidon?

344
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,380
I think we all had to read it in high school, where you got this super cognitive guy who

345
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,380
has serious, serious disability, took a pill, and he got super brilliant for a while, and

346
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,380
then it went away.

347
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,380
It won't take you away.

348
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,380
You'll just kind of have like a little wave.

349
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,380
You'll start here, you'll go up, you'll come back to where here was when you started.

350
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,380
That's how a cognitive boost works.

351
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,380
It lasts longer the longer you actually work with this.

352
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:41,380
There's nothing to say that this isn't good, but the efficacy here is really the quality

353
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,380
of code that you output will actually improve over time.

354
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,380
Coding empathetically is good.

355
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,380
So the question is, what's the right music?

356
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,380
And this is where it starts to get a bit complicated, and I'm going to get a little bit opinionated.

357
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,380
It starts with your preference.

358
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,380
If you were raised in a certain culture, even if it was here in the United States, your

359
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,380
parents, your caretakers, your geographic location, all of these things have an influence

360
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,380
on the music that you listen to.

361
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,380
Whether that's a reactive influence or, you know, it's a positive influence is totally

362
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,380
up to you.

363
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,380
There's a type of music that was played at your house.

364
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,380
There's a type of music that your grandparents played.

365
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,380
There's a type of music that you heard when you went to the supermarket.

366
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,380
This all influenced what you listen to today.

367
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:29,380
The ability to unlock the better cognitive function starts in being able to identify that music.

368
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,380
So for me, it was kind of easy.

369
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,380
I was a musician.

370
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,380
I could first look at the things that I've been playing for most of my life, which is

371
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,380
punk rock and emo and, you know, general rock, alternative rock music.

372
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,380
I know that that's my wheelhouse.

373
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,380
Like, I could sit down, I could play, somebody hand me a guitar, I could play that stuff

374
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,380
right now on stage.

375
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,380
So it wasn't that hard for me, but for some people it's a little more difficult.

376
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,380
Some people don't even know that they like types of music just because they've never

377
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,380
been exposed to them.

378
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,380
So how do we find what we like and how do we find what works?

379
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,380
So you start with what floats your boat.

380
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,380
I'll use an example.

381
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,380
Andrew right here, since you're so a participant.

382
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,380
What kind of music do you like?

383
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,380
Mostly jazz.

384
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,380
Jazz is super, thank you.

385
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,380
Andrew's not a plant, but let's hear it for Andrew for being a great participant.

386
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:22,380
So jazz is easy because jazz starts off right away.

387
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:28,380
Instrumental music is very helpful with this cognitive boost because there's no words to distract you.

388
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,380
When there's words, you want to sing along, you want to do things.

389
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,380
That can happen in jazz.

390
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,380
Sometimes you start tapping or start pretending you can play a trumpet and you're like,

391
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,380
and you're like, I'm Charlie Parker.

392
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,380
You're not Charlie Parker.

393
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,380
Nobody's Charlie Parker.

394
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,380
But Charlie Parker is actually something that I listen to quite a lot, especially his album Cha Cha,

395
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,380
which was stunning because it's all instrumental.

396
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,380
There's a little bit of talking in the background because back then there was like one microphone in a room.

397
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,380
But I can churn out code like there's no tomorrow to that album.

398
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:06,380
I see a slowdown if I switch to Miles Davis' Something Blue because it's a much more mellow album.

399
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,380
But Charlie Parker was like, man, back in the Cha Cha days, he was rocking it out.

400
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,380
Let's say you're more into like, you know, The Grateful Dead or Phish.

401
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,380
Sorry.

402
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,380
You shouldn't be.

403
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,380
But why not?

404
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,380
There's a great instrumental band called Tea Leaf Green out of Chicago.

405
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,380
And the jam band, just like Phish or The Grateful Dead, but they're all instrumental.

406
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,380
So you can see the cognitive boost from that.

407
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,380
Let's say you really like metal.

408
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,380
And I know a lot of people like metal, instrumentals.

409
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,380
That's crazy.

410
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,380
Can I just listen to the solos?

411
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,380
No, because you'll be doing this.

412
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,380
Your fingers are very far away from the keyboard.

413
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:47,380
But there's this great band, especially if you like like super anthemic metal.

414
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,380
There's a band called Caspian.

415
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,380
They're absolutely amazing.

416
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,380
And every time you listen to them, you feel like you can totally take on the world.

417
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,380
So there's an instrumental option.

418
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,380
Once you figure that out, you start to break out of that.

419
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,380
You start to look for more boats.

420
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,380
So Andrew likes jazz.

421
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,380
He listens to Charlie Parker a bit.

422
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,380
Well, maybe you can start drifting into blues a little bit.

423
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:11,380
Maybe get out of the bebop phase and listen to, I'm going to say it, listen to Kenny G,

424
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,380
who kind of rocks that saxophone.

425
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,380
Listen to different things.

426
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,380
They're all going to benefit you.

427
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,380
And the more that you bring into that, the more playlists you put together,

428
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,380
the more things that you build, the longer you see that cognitive boost for.

429
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:30,380
You can go for hours and see a 9 to 10 point cognitive boost in the work that you're doing.

430
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,380
Granted, I don't think anybody's going to sit there with an EKG and be like,

431
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,380
literally PJ was right.

432
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,380
But trust me, it's happening.

433
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,380
Another personal example, this one comes out of breaking out of the mold.

434
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,380
My brother, my younger brother, who is a hip hop artist, used to be,

435
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,380
he now works for the post office, which happens to a lot of hip hop artists that don't make it.

436
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,380
But he said to me once, he's like, you know what?

437
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,380
You can say any kind of music, any genre of music you want.

438
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,380
I guarantee you like a song in that genre.

439
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,380
I was like, oh, yeah, country.

440
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,380
He looked me dead in the eye, didn't even take a breath and said, Kenny Rogers, the gambler.

441
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,380
And I was like, you son of a bitch.

442
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,380
He's right. Love that song. Who doesn't love that song?

443
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:24,380
There chances are there's some song, some piece of music in every genre that you will enjoy

444
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:30,380
that you can then incorporate into what you're doing and see that cognitive benefit.

445
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:36,380
In his South by Southwest keynote a few years ago, Bruce Springsteen, the boss,

446
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,380
I worked for him, specifically addressed the issue of genre.

447
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,380
Sometimes this is a problem, he opined.

448
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,380
We get too caught up in what's right and we stop paying attention to what sounds good,

449
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,380
what makes us feel good.

450
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,380
And I'd add that when we feel good, we work better.

451
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,380
So don't get too stuck on this. Focus on different kinds of music.

452
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,380
It's important, while we're seeing what proverbially floats our boat and what might,

453
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,380
to be careful of the placebo effect. Works kind of like this.

454
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,380
You like the music you're listening to. It seems to be effective.

455
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,380
You are reluctant to branch out. You're reluctant to check out other music.

456
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,380
You stop to see that boost. You feel like I'm feeling sluggish

457
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,380
and I'm not doing what I thought I was going to do.

458
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,380
This isn't working the way PJ said. PJ said this would work.

459
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,380
PJ lies. We should kill PJ.

460
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,380
So don't get to that point. Jet two, a few points of that.

461
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,380
This is when finding new music is a key part and there's lots of different ways to do that.

462
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,380
Just like working on any one project over time can cause stagnation.

463
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,380
If you've just been working on that authentication piece for three weeks,

464
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,380
you're like, I hate authentication. I don't care if anyone authenticates anywhere.

465
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,380
Security is a joke. I'm going to stop my job.

466
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,380
And you get mentally constipated.

467
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,380
Listening to the same music can cause the same thing.

468
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,380
You can't just listen to the same four albums over and over again.

469
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,380
Take time when working on less sensitive projects especially

470
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,380
to explore different kinds of music and reach out there to see what's going on.

471
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,380
This has changed. This is part of the landscape that's changed.

472
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,380
So for those of us who are probably a little bit older,

473
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,380
one of the things that we used to do is like we'd go to a friend's house

474
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,380
and they'd have albums or they'd have tapes or CDs and be like,

475
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,380
yo, you got to check this out.

476
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,380
But our music tastes have become so personal.

477
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,380
You pop a pair of earbuds in and no one ever really knows what you're doing.

478
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,380
And even though Spotify has like a social aspect where you'd be like,

479
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,380
oh, Andrew's listening to Charlie Parker right now.

480
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,380
I'm sorry to pick on you when you're going out of the room, Andrew.

481
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,380
I'd be like, oh, maybe I'll listen to Charlie Parker.

482
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,380
Like I'm not really paying attention to that when I'm focusing on writing my code.

483
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,380
So you have to find other ways.

484
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,380
There's cool collaborative ways like Plug.DJ is a European thing where you can actually go in.

485
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,380
I think it attaches to SoundCloud, Spotify, and YouTube.

486
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,380
And you actually take turns DJing for each other.

487
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,380
I've done this at several jobs. It's great.

488
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,380
Like you sit there, you have an opportunity to chat.

489
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,380
Everybody's doing things.

490
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,380
And you can just listen to the music and get new music and be like,

491
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,380
what is that jam? Oh, I can look and see.

492
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,380
This is amazing.

493
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,380
Oh, I didn't know that my buddy Tyler was really into odd Canadian Southern Ontario

494
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,380
alternative rock music from the early and late 1990s.

495
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,380
Sorry, Tyler. I know you're not here, but that's true.

496
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,380
Pandora is a seriously great way to do this.

497
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,380
Pandora, you just put it in, pay for it.

498
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:15,380
Pay a couple bucks for whatever Pandora is to get rid of the ads and just let that flow.

499
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,380
My wife and I, when we were getting ready for this trip, we were cleaning the house.

500
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,380
I just went in and I was like, you know what we want to listen to?

501
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,380
The jam in Elvis Costello.

502
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,380
I put it in Pandora, put it on the speakers all over the house.

503
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,380
We got the house clean in like an hour.

504
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,380
I don't live in a very big house.

505
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:34,380
But like it got us stimulated, got us moving, and we just wanted to keep going.

506
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,380
That's a great one.

507
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,380
Also, and this is like somewhat controversial because I'm super opinionated in this space,

508
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,380
but Reddit, maybe not our music because those people are weird.

509
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:49,380
But if you look at things like our listen to this, our listen to me,

510
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,380
you can learn about all kinds of bands and artists that are coming up

511
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,380
that maybe don't get the exposure of a Taylor Swift or a Justin Bieber or a Mozart

512
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,380
because Mozart was pretty much just like those people.

513
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,380
He did have awesome hair.

514
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,380
But you get the opportunity to see what other people are listening to.

515
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,380
You can incorporate that into the things you're doing and see that cognitive boost.

516
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,380
What else?

517
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,380
There's also musicforprogramming.com.

518
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:18,380
The first time I ever did this talk was a few years ago, and this guy got really into it.

519
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,380
And he was like, I'm going to build this site.

520
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,380
And he has like a whole list of songs.

521
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,380
It's like some of it's techno, some of it's different genres,

522
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,380
but you can get into it and see what's going on.

523
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,380
It's all instrumental.

524
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,380
And I think it's still around unless he had some kind of lapse on his URL.

525
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,380
But check it out.

526
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,380
It's a new way to check out music.

527
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,380
I will say this.

528
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,380
Safety first.

529
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,380
This is a small PSA.

530
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,380
How many of you use AirPods?

531
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,380
How many of you use earbuds, wired earbuds?

532
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,380
How many of you use some other in-ear thing?

533
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,380
Yeah, don't.

534
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,380
That is really bad for you.

535
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:59,380
You are generally piping heavy bass, because that's the way they build these things now,

536
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,380
heavy bass directly into your eardrums.

537
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,380
It is super damaging, and you will get a thing called tinnitus.

538
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,380
Who knows what tinnitus is?

539
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,380
How many of you are listening to that right now?

540
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,380
Don't play the drums without earplugs, kids.

541
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,380
That's my PSA.

542
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,380
Over the ear, sometimes they're referred to as cans.

543
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,380
Over the ear, earphones are much better for you.

544
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,380
They have better sound.

545
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,380
Their microphones aren't as great as AirPods or anything like that,

546
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,380
but they are much safer for you.

547
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,380
They will not damage your ears as much.

548
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,380
You will not find that you have intense wax buildup after a certain period of time,

549
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,380
because they are not in your ear.

550
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,380
You are not doing anything invasive to your body.

551
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,380
Be safe.

552
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,380
Keep your music at levels that you can handle.

553
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,380
Pass that out.

554
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,380
Start at about half.

555
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,380
Do not listen to music extremely loud.

556
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,380
You will damage your hearing, and it is a very bad situation.

557
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,380
I would also recommend studio-quality headphones, if you can afford it.

558
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,380
Avoid things like skull candy.

559
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,380
They are there to look good and not be good.

560
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,380
Avoid Beats by Dre.

561
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,380
Sorry, Dre.

562
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,380
It's not your day.

563
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,380
They are super, super bassy in giving you low tones that you can't even hear

564
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,380
that are destroying your hearing.

565
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,380
Focus on studio-quality headphones from Sony, Sennheiser.

566
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,380
I don't work for those companies, but I personally use Urban Ears.

567
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,380
Urban Ears are my favorite kind of over-the-ear headphones.

568
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,380
They kind of look like the ones that you had back in school

569
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,380
when they would test your hearing.

570
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,380
You'd be like, yes, I hear that.

571
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,380
That's what they look like.

572
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,380
Who cares how good it looks?

573
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,380
Protect your hearing.

574
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,380
End of PSA.

575
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,380
People also worry about sitting and coding with headphones on

576
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,380
or with blasting music.

577
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,380
It's something that will put off interacting with other folks.

578
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,380
This is more of an issue when we worked in offices.

579
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,380
This might partially be true.

580
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,380
People might approach you when you have headphones on

581
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,380
and not want to talk to you.

582
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,380
But it's also true that we're most productive in non-pairing situations

583
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,380
when we're heads-downs and not interacting in the first place.

584
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,380
When you're pairing, don't wear headphones.

585
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,380
That's not cool.

586
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,380
Your pairing partner doesn't appreciate it.

587
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,380
But if you are in an in-office setting

588
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,380
and you have your headphones on for head-down work,

589
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,380
that is okay.

590
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,380
Just make it clear to people that you're interruptible if you are.

591
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,380
And if you are not interruptible,

592
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,380
you should also be letting them know that anyway.

593
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,380
While the RIAA

594
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,380
is not really cool with it,

595
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,380
share.

596
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,380
I'm not advocating piracy here.

597
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,380
But,

598
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,380
if you have different ways to share music,

599
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,380
share music.

600
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,380
If you used Spotify, Apple Music, TIDAL, any of them,

601
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,380
they all have the opportunity to share.

602
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,380
I know, because I have a Twitter account

603
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,380
called PJ's Album of the Day.

604
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,380
I don't do it every day.

605
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,380
But it's not always an album.

606
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,380
That's as close as I could get to what I was trying to do.

607
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,380
There's also a great thing called combine.fm

608
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,380
that you can drop the URL from your streaming service

609
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,380
and it will add all of the other sharing services

610
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,380
so people can see what you're listening to.

611
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,380
What else?

612
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,380
Make a mixtape.

613
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,700
So that you can see.

614
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,460
How many people have actually physically made a mixtape?

615
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:06,220
That was a DL check on how many people are of a certain age.

616
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,060
I love mixtapes.

617
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,540
I always love, because you know what?

618
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,060
You built them back in the day to be like,

619
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,260
this is how I feel about you.

620
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,860
This is how I feel we relate.

621
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,620
We are cool, because we all like this music.

622
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,940
And I also like this other music that's also on there.

623
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,060
You should check it out.

624
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,660
It builds a community around the music

625
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,340
you're doing, just like the community we have in tech.

626
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,540
So share things out.

627
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,660
It's kind of like open sourcing your music library, which

628
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,820
you can't technically do.

629
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,660
You should also take a break.

630
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,300
Take a chance.

631
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,620
Pick up an instrument, even if you don't know how to play it.

632
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,100
Make stupid pictures and put them on the internet.

633
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,260
There are so many people that are actually musicians,

634
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,780
as well as being coders.

635
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,860
Play music.

636
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,300
Do it yourself.

637
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,140
Build things out.

638
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,420
Figure out what's going on.

639
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,420
Help with the math and coding skills that you have.

640
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,380
Bring kids in.

641
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,900
This is me playing with the original RailsConf band.

642
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,100
They just were like, hey, we're going to put a band together.

643
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,660
Do you play drums?

644
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,700
And I was like, yes, all right, cool, let's do it.

645
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,300
Do it with code.

646
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,460
This is the controversial part.

647
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,380
You ready?

648
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,260
There are so many great JavaScript libraries

649
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,260
for making music that you can actually code in terminal,

650
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,060
code in your IDE, push it, and it will change

651
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,420
the way the music is working.

652
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,060
There are performances of this online.

653
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,540
I highly recommend it.

654
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,260
This isn't going to happen overnight.

655
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,740
Figuring out what music works for you

656
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,780
is going to take a while.

657
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,700
There's nothing that's perfect for everyone.

658
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,860
There is no catch-all answer.

659
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,220
You will need to explore some things to unlock your ability

660
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,420
and to code better.

661
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,380
Once you find the right groove, stay in it

662
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,620
and then move to the other one.

663
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,740
Share with what you're doing.

664
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,500
These are some of the resources that I used.

665
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,980
The point here is we all want to be better coders.

666
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,460
In order to be better coders, we have to have better brains.

667
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,940
In order to have better brains, we

668
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,420
have to find ways to do that.

669
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,940
Music is one of the easiest ways to unlock your cognitive power

670
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,140
and be more consistently a better person, a better coder,

671
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,540
and build a better community.

672
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,460
And with that, thank you very much.
