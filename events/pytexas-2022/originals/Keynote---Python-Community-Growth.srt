1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Thank you all for having me.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,920
Thank you to the PyTexas organizers for having me.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:17,620
Yes, so my first talk was at PyTexas in 2013 in College Station, and I think my first conference

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,940
was actually PyTexas in 2010, it was in Waco at the time.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:27,520
So it's nice to be here at another PyTexas, and also nice to be keynoting.

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,600
So here on the slide, there are some details about me.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,320
So the talk is called Python Community Growth, and that's what I'll be focusing on.

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,900
Since I've become active in the Python community, I have felt that one of the best ways that

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,680
I can make a contribution to the community was by helping to grow the contributor base

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,920
for the community.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,960
And so the first talk that I gave in 2013 was somewhat related to that.

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,280
The content of the talk was more about sort of things you could do with Python as spreadsheets

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,440
and how that could draw non-developers into the Python community, and then those people

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,320
could become future contributors.

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:16,040
So that's kind of been a running theme, sometimes a less obvious theme in the different talks

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,160
that I've done in my community activity.

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,120
So currently, I'm an engineer at RevSys, I'll talk a little bit about that more later.

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,880
It's a Django shop, and we do a lot of interesting things.

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,960
Before I was a Python developer, I was an accountant and university instructor and got

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
an MBA.

21
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,040
I taught accounting in English and other things in a couple of different countries, well,

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,200
two different countries, here in Texas and in China.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,680
And so once I decided the accounting business-y thing was not what I was going to do anymore,

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,160
I made a transition into software development.

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,960
So there are other things that I do as well, and you can see here on my slides my name

26
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,680
and then also my Twitter handle was probably the best way to reach me.

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,160
So among other things, I'm also a DjangoCon US organizer, I've done that since 2016.

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,040
I'm also the Defna North American Ambassador.

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,520
Defna is the Django Events Foundation North America, that is a nonprofit that is tasked

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,940
with putting on DjangoCon US.

31
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,680
One of the things that I do as the Defna North American Ambassador is to let people know,

32
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,680
A, that Defna exists because it's a relatively new organization, I think only been around

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
since 2014.

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,040
The 2015 DjangoCon US was the first Defna DjangoCon, and that was here in Austin, but

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,720
the second key part of that is letting people know that DjangoCon US can take place in any

36
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,600
North American city, and so the next time a CFP goes out, and I'll be reaching out to

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,520
people when that happens, people from your city can put together a CFP and try to have

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,320
DjangoCon US hosted in your North American city, so that is an important thing to know.

39
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,240
That's the Twitter handle for Defnado, or you can go to Defna.org to get more information

40
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,720
about the organization and what they do.

41
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,440
I talked about my company RevSys, and one of the reasons I'm talking about this is because,

42
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:09,160
and this isn't a, my company sponsored this type of talk, it's more a matter of, it relates

43
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:16,000
to the content of my talk, we're a small company, there are eight of us total, and then, so

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,520
on the prior slide, I talked about some of the stuff that I do, so of the remaining seven

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:27,080
people, we have all these things, so the DSF founder and the person who helped make Django

46
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,560
open source, so Jacob Kaplan-Moss, if you know that name, two former Django software

47
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,840
foundation presidents, so Jacob Kaplan-Moss and Frank Wiles, who is our, the president

48
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,080
of RevSys, and Kaplan-Moss is one of the other founders, two former DjangoCon US chairs,

49
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,280
there are two people who have chaired DjangoCon US in the past, but one of the founders of

50
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,340
Defna and his former president, Jeff, who is one of our partners, and Jeff is also currently

51
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,560
one of the Python Software Foundation directors, and then there's Catherine, and so Catherine

52
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:04,560
doesn't have sort of a fancy title or whatnot, but over the course of the last, I know several

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,080
years, Catherine has made a lot of things work in the background for DjangoCon US and

54
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:17,160
for Defna, for DjangoCon US and for Defna and for the DSF, she's sort of our chief admin

55
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,680
person at RevSys, and so at one point, the RevSys president was the DSF president, and

56
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,080
so Catherine helped a lot of stuff there, and as members of RevSys have been working

57
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,320
on organizing DjangoCon US, Catherine has also helped a lot of stuff with Defna, so

58
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,920
I point these things out about my company because one of the reasons I work with this

59
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,840
group is because we're all sort of of the same mind or of a similar mind as far as

60
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,080
community contributions and things of that nature, so one of the key points of the talk

61
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,920
here is that Python itself and Django, which I'm fairly involved in the Django community,

62
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,840
so that comes up a lot, but Django is itself written in Python, so Python is Django, or

63
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,440
Django is Python, but Python is Django, but both are open source projects, and what that

64
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,600
means is that they are built by volunteers, people in their free time doing all sorts

65
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,640
of extra work to make these things happen, but in a situation like that, more contributors

66
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,760
are always needed, there's always more help needed, more people working on a project or

67
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,840
on a process makes that process easier, more hands light in the load, as they say, and

68
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,560
so that's one of the reasons I've tried to focus on trying to grow the contributor base

69
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,720
of the Python community, and it's important to note that contributions aren't just code,

70
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,680
often in a developer community there's a tendency to think that if someone's going to contribute

71
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,040
to Python or to Django or to something else, another project, that it's all just about

72
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,240
writing code or adding new features and that sort of thing, those things are useful, those

73
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,480
things are important, but there's much more to it than that documentation and that sort

74
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,280
of thing. Conference organization, all the different legal issues that come up with defending

75
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:13,280
the IP of both Python and Django and other things, fundraising, if you talk to any of

76
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,840
the conference organizers, for instance, the people you see here in the orange shirts for

77
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:23,840
organizing PyTexas, or if you attend a meetup in your local area or your hometown, if you

78
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,560
talk to a meetup organizer, they will tell you that there are all sorts of things that

79
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,720
need to be done, and so there are a number of different contributions that need to be

80
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,800
made to the community, especially as Python has become such a large project, so there

81
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,560
are lots of things that are needed beyond just code, and so you need help, there's more

82
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,800
help that's needed, but then the question is where is that help going to come from?

83
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,640
So when you look at people who might be actual contributors, you have two necessary conditions

84
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,080
for potential contributors. One is they have to be people who find some value in Python,

85
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,840
people who actually use Python and find some value in it. I'll probably just use the term

86
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,760
Pythonistas throughout my talk, but anybody who uses Python and gets value from it and

87
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,640
realizes, hey, this is good, this helps me, this is of some benefit, but then the second

88
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,800
condition, which is a little more the focus of this first part of the talk, is that those

89
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,960
people actually have to feel like they're included in the community, they have to feel

90
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,960
like they're members of the community, and this is important, these two necessary conditions.

91
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,400
The first condition is necessary, but not sufficient in the mathematical parlance. Someone

92
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,200
can use Python and get all sorts of benefit from it, but they don't have to interact with

93
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,060
the rest of us. They don't have to actually make any contributions to the Python community

94
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,400
if they don't want to. They can just use Python, benefit from it, and then go on about their

95
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,400
day. That second part, that a potential contributor has to feel like they're a part of our community

96
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:01,800
is very important, and I think that's someplace where we can make some improvement.

97
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,240
When we look at people who use Python, we've got this, what I call the Python use spectrum,

98
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:15,240
and so this talk, I'm sort of one of those people who's always kind of working on talks

99
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,600
and that sort of thing, so I guess I probably started working on this talk in 2013, technically.

100
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,520
The idea is to draw from that, but certain chunks of it come from a keynote that I gave

101
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,640
at PyGotham in 2019, and that talk was focused more specifically on this, the Python use

102
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,920
spectrum. I'll be mentioning some things from that here in this talk, and you can find that

103
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,520
PyGotham 2019 keynote, it's on YouTube, if you want more details about that specific

104
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,680
area. But this idea to me is important because you have a wide range of people who use Python,

105
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,040
and so I've created this sort of spectrum to describe them, so on one end you've got

106
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,800
programming, was it my left, your left, also your left? Mirrors are hard. So on the left

107
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,240
you've got programming, and on the far right you've got software engineering, so these

108
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:12,240
are the users of Python, and everyone who uses Python, they're there. So everyone who

109
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,720
uses Python in some way or gets some value or benefit from Python falls somewhere in

110
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,720
this spectrum, and so here we've got some definitions. So what these look at are the

111
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,840
different ways that people use code. So first bullet point, so who writes the code? For

112
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,560
programmers, usually the code is written by individuals, software engineering, the code

113
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,680
is often written in teams. Who's using the code? In programming, it's often just the

114
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,640
author, someone's writing code for themselves, so the author of the code is using it. In

115
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,080
software engineering, you're usually writing code to be used by other people, not the individual

116
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,320
people who write the code themselves. When does the code run or how is it run? In the

117
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,760
programming context, you've probably got somebody who's writing code that is being run while

118
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,040
they're looking at it. The code is being run with supervision, and in the software engineering

119
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,040
context the code is designed to be able to run in isolation. You don't want to have to

120
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,920
write code and then deploy it and then just sit and watch it and make sure it works. In

121
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,440
the programming context, the primary product is the output of the code. So if you're writing

122
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,360
code for yourself to run with your supervision, you don't really care about the code, you

123
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,360
care about the output of the code. Whereas in the software engineering context, the code

124
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,960
itself is the actual output, that's the actual product. And then your motivations, why you're

125
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,040
writing this code. In the programming context, you're writing the code for utility, you're

126
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,080
writing code that would do something for you, and that's your primary concern. Whereas in the

127
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,120
software engineering context, you're writing code because that's your profession, that's your

128
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,680
job. And so again, dig back the spectrum, and everyone who uses Python falls somewhere along

129
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,680
the spectrum. Some people start at the programming end and stay there because they don't have any

130
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,680
need to go any further. Other people, well, everyone starts at the programming end, but some

131
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,800
people aspire to get to the software engineering end and stay there and to advance their skills

132
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:23,560
there. But again, everyone who uses Python falls along the spectrum. So the big problem that I

133
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,280
see is that our community culture is heavily biased towards software engineering, and that creates

134
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:35,400
an issue where software engineering, that approach is seen as the only way to actually do

135
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,640
programming, the only way to actually write code, the correct way to write code, and that

136
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,360
is true in some cases, but for other people who have different contexts, you don't need all of

137
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:56,680
the software engineering tools and accoutrements and details that software engineers use. So why

138
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:03,520
is that important? This bias towards software engineering often manifests itself as a bias

139
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:12,280
against programming, and again, our community culture is often very heavily influenced by the

140
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,840
software engineering approach. And as we've seen, Python has grown very quickly in data science,

141
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:25,240
and data science is probably the biggest, sort of most noteworthy area of growth, but there are

142
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,240
lots of other areas where Python has grown that aren't software engineering. There are lots of

143
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,640
people who aren't data scientists and don't think of themselves as data scientists, but they've

144
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,120
found that Python is helpful to them, the syntax is clear and straightforward, and people have

145
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,840
found, oh, I can use this code to make my life better, and I can write five, ten lines of code,

146
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:54,920
and it makes something better for me, and I can just go on with my day. But again, a lot of our

147
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,080
community culture is heavily selected towards software engineering, and that's as if that is

148
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:08,240
the one true way to do things. And so, we've got these different people who are using Python,

149
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,920
and they're all, they could all be potentially contributing to software engineering, so these

150
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,760
people who exist along the spectrum, anyone along the spectrum could be contributing to Python,

151
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,920
but because of the software engineering bias, we often end up pushing away people who aren't

152
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:32,000
actually software engineers, but the software engineers aren't a small portion of the community,

153
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,920
but software engineers are no longer as large a percentage of the community as they once were,

154
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,640
and that's really kind of a good thing, because Python is so helpful to so many people who aren't,

155
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,440
you know, who don't think of themselves as real programmers or a professional, you know, I don't

156
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,640
want to get a degree in computer science and blah, blah, blah. Well, no, you don't have to, you can,

157
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:55,000
you can, you know, read, automate the boring things with Python, or you can find a blog post or two

158
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,480
that will let you solve a particular problem that you have in Python, and so you don't need, you

159
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,640
don't need testing and, you know, CI and Docker and Git, you might not need any of those things,

160
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,440
you can just write your 12 lines of Python or your 150 lines of Python and ta-da, problem solved,

161
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,440
and you'll go on and live your better life. And so, the issue is we are sometimes pushing non-software

162
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,920
engineers away from the community. So, we go back to those two conditions of people who could

163
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,520
contribute, people who find value in Python, and people who feel like they're members of our

164
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,320
community. Well, if we've got people who are using Python that we're pushing away from the

165
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:39,160
community, then we're minimizing our contributor base. So, one of the things that stood out to me,

166
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:48,120
in Python 2019, our KM here, this is Russell Keith McGee, a former Django Software Foundation

167
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,520
president and someone who has done a lot of work in the area of open source sustainability and

168
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,360
trying to sort of figure out how do we make open source development a sustainable thing,

169
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,440
how do we keep it going and moving. I've got some screenshots here from his talk,

170
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,560
but the talk covered a number of different things, but the things I'm going to focus on

171
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,200
here are how do we get more support, more contributors for our community. And so,

172
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,080
two of the things he points out here are, you know, paying, you can pay professionals to support

173
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,760
a project, and you also want to try to build a team with contribution skills that are beyond

174
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,240
code. So, the earlier slide that I had where we talked about some of the different things,

175
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,920
the different types of contributions that are needed beyond code, there's some situations where

176
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,680
you can pay people to do that stuff, people who have those skills, and you also, again,

177
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,840
in building this team of contributors, you want to bring as many people with those different skills

178
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:45,440
into our community as contributors as possible, not just developers. So, I'll go through these

179
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,320
sort of a little quickly, but these are screenshots from Russell's talk in 2019. When money makes

180
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:58,240
things happen, expertise costs. And so, if you want people who know how to do conference

181
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,720
organizing or fundraising or the different legal things that are needed to make the PSF or the DSF

182
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,840
or a definite valid nonprofit so that people can contribute to them or any sort of marketing

183
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,240
information or what have you, people who have that expertise want to be paid for that expertise.

184
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:22,160
Project management, UX, UI, UX design, all these other things that are related to any sort of

185
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,120
software project but aren't just directly writing code, who organize the events, legal advice,

186
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,200
all these sorts of things. So, who does all this stuff? We need people who do these things.

187
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,720
This last point, who makes strategic deals? I know over several years, there has been a

188
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,280
fundraising thing with Humble Bundle to help raise funds for the PSF. Someone had to make that deal.

189
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,840
It might have been a developer, but people with CS degrees or people who are professional

190
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:55,600
software engineers aren't always the best at peopling or doing strategic business deals and

191
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,400
things of that nature. There's a difference between code optimization and fundraising and

192
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:11,160
making strategic business deals. So, those people are needed. And another important point here is

193
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,080
that these people who have these different skills, let's just say that money fell from the sky and

194
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:24,560
Google decided to just give the PSF $100 million. Let's just say $500 million, just a big number.

195
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:31,840
A whole bunch of money to do whatever the PSF wants. Well, these skilled professionals, they

196
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:39,240
have options. They can work with other people. So, the PSF's $100 million is the same as another

197
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,880
people's $100 million. So, why would I work with this set of people versus that set of people?

198
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,200
This goes back to the idea of the conditions you need for people to be contributors. People who are

199
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,080
getting value from Python and also people who feel like they're members of our community. So,

200
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,480
if you have people who have these skills that we need and are members of our community and they

201
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,120
feel like they're members of our community, then when there's a choice of, okay, well, I can get

202
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:13,080
paid $100,000 a year to do this thing for Python or to do it for Apple. Well, I'm a Pythonista. I'll

203
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,240
take the PSF's $100,000 and I'll keep my iPhone and use my Apple stuff, but I'm going to go work

204
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,000
with these people because I'm part of that community. Those are my people. I'm going to work

205
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,920
with them. And so, this idea of making sure that we are including potential contributors in our

206
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:36,560
community, it resonates because it's something that makes decisions as far as how things happen

207
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:45,840
and how things don't happen. So, how do we make this happen? This idea of making sure that we're

208
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:54,360
including people in our community and making them feel that they're members of the community. So,

209
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:02,720
here we get into the scolity portion, slightly scolity portion of the talk. The idea of senior

210
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,400
engineers needing to be better. So, in many cases, I talked before about the Python spectrum and how

211
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:14,680
software engineering tends to heavily influence our community culture. So, within that, our more

212
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:21,120
senior software engineers tend to have an even larger influence on our community culture. Some

213
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,240
of that is because they are the people, when people come in and they're looking for expertise

214
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,800
on, oh, well, how do I do this thing with Python or how do I make Python do what I want, they will

215
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,800
often try to, you would want to talk to an expert. You wouldn't want to talk to a novice. You wouldn't

216
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,200
want to talk to an expert. And so, those are often the first people they interact with. But then the

217
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:46,160
other issue is, as we have new software engineers even coming into the community, more junior software

218
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,800
engineers, those people are going to be influenced by the senior software engineers that they work

219
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:56,480
with. And so, you've got this sort of outsized impact that the more senior software engineers have

220
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,360
on our community and the community culture. And as such, since they're having that outsized impact,

221
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,480
they also bear a larger burden of responsibility as far as improving our community culture and

222
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,040
helping to make sure that we can have as wide a range of contributors as possible.

223
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:18,400
And with that, we start to look at our local communities. And so, the reality is, when people

224
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,360
encounter Python, you know, for the first time, they're much more likely to encounter Python or

225
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,960
the Python community at a local meetup than they are at, say, at PyCon or PyTexas or DjangoCon US.

226
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:38,560
So, to use an analogy, that might not seem flattering, but it's accurate, but it's not

227
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,920
might not seem flattering, but it's accurate. Local meetup organizers are basically sort of

228
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:51,280
like the Walmart greeters of the Python community. Again, for many people, the first time you actually

229
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,800
encounter another Pythonista is going to be at a local meetup. Now, you can just go to Python.org

230
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:02,400
and download Python or whatever, or you can, you know, use the package manager on your distro of

231
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,840
choice, or you can use Homebrew on your Mac or whatever. You can download Python and use it

232
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,320
without talking to anybody. But if you actually want to get some help with Python and interact

233
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,120
with other Python people, you're probably not going to think, okay, I'm trying to write this

234
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,800
Python program. I used to be an accountant, so I use a spreadsheet example. I'm trying to write

235
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,440
this Python code that will import this stuff from a spreadsheet and process it. How do I do that?

236
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,640
You know, I'm going to go to PyCon US and ask somebody. That's what I'll do. That seems like

237
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,200
the best way. Well, no. Unless you happen to live in the city where PyCon US is happening,

238
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,800
this year, Salt Lake City, you're probably not going to do that. You're probably going to look

239
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,880
for your local Python meetup and talk to someone there and get some help from some of those people.

240
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,120
But the people who organize our local Python meetups are generally often our more senior

241
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,520
engineers. There are very few people who started learning Python like three months ago and decide,

242
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,360
I'm going to organize a Python meetup. It could happen, but it generally doesn't. It's usually

243
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,280
done by people who are more experienced Python developers. So our senior engineers are often the

244
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,720
people who organize these local meetups, which are the first point of contact with non-Pythonistas

245
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,080
and the Python community. And as a result, those senior engineers often shape this culture that

246
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:21,360
happens in these meetups. So what's happening in your local meetups? Are you having a space

247
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,800
that is like a cool place for other senior Python developers to hang out? Or are you creating a

248
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:36,080
space where new people are welcomed and included in the community? So finding a space and having

249
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,760
a speaker and finding food, those are all great things in a meetup. Literally everybody likes

250
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,320
to go to a meetup where there's food. That always works out well. But there's more to it than just

251
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:55,440
that. And there is sometimes a tendency to maybe optimize the meetup more towards, and you get a

252
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,080
certain amount of unconscious bias. There's a tendency to sometimes optimize a meetup where

253
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,760
you as a senior Python developer are comfortable, and other senior Python developers that you know

254
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,640
were also comfortable in this space, and people who aren't as senior might feel left out.

255
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,280
Excuse me. People who aren't senior might feel left out. Or people who aren't even trying to

256
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,160
pursue a software engineering path might feel left out. People who just want to use Python

257
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:30,800
to solve their individual problems. But again, these local meetups, our local community activities

258
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:38,480
are the first contact with the rest of the non-Python community. And those community cultures

259
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,240
tend to be shaped fairly heavily by Python senior engineers. And again, more of this burden of

260
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,600
responsibility falls on these people. And it's important to try to make sure that your meetup

261
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,320
and your meetup culture is as welcoming as possible. Because otherwise we'll miss out on

262
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:03,360
a lot of new potential contributors. So we've got sort of a new criteria for senior developer.

263
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,720
It seems like traditionally or in the past, senior developer was seen as someone who

264
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,680
writes really good Python code. Or someone who knows how to architect software and has all sorts

265
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:23,840
of advanced Python skills and abilities. And that's important. But I'll add a few more points

266
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,360
here. As a senior developer, you should be someone who's able to advance the skills of a more junior

267
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:37,120
developer. And if you're someone who thinks, well, I'm a senior developer because I can write Python

268
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,240
really well and I can architect these things and write really complex software, I don't need to

269
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,800
interact with more junior people or help them advance. That's the intellectual equivalent of,

270
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:53,680
well, it works on my machine. Which I think we have all learned is really an anti-pattern.

271
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,200
Especially as a software engineer, because if it works on your machine, well, the whole point of

272
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,400
the code is to have it work somewhere else. So you're sort of doing yourself a disservice.

273
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,480
It might seem like a good thing, but it's not really working in your favor. So instead of a

274
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,600
senior developer being, and I'm using developer and engineer interchangeably here, instead of a

275
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,560
senior developer being someone who just sort of is able to write code really well on their own

276
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:26,240
or interact well with other senior developers, another necessary criteria of a senior developer

277
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,480
is that you should be able to help advance the skills of a more junior developer. And if you

278
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,320
can't or won't do that, you might need to senior a little bit better. So that's something to consider.

279
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:42,160
But also, a senior developer should be able to retain junior developers as they advance.

280
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,320
So if you're in a situation where, and I know some people will think, well, hold on, Kojo.

281
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,400
I'm a software developer. I'm not HR. I'm not the chief people person or whatever. But hear me out.

282
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,200
If you are someone, you're working with more junior developers and you're helping them advance

283
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,320
their skills, but then once they're advanced, they're like, okay, I've dealt with you as long

284
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:10,560
as I can. I've got to get away from you. Are you really senioring well? And so if you're not

285
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,040
doing both of these things, if you're not helping the more junior developers around your advance,

286
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,320
but you're also not creating an environment that they want to stay in and that they want to

287
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,480
continue to be a part of, you may need to reconsider some of your senioring options.

288
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:30,320
This comes up especially in light of the talk that we hear about so many people,

289
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,800
the shortage of software engineers and people not being able to find enough software engineers and

290
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,440
I can't find a good developer and that sort of thing. One of the simple solutions is, well,

291
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,280
if you can't find quote unquote good developers, perhaps make a good developer. And if you

292
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,880
are not able to help a less experienced developer become a better developer,

293
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,560
maybe you're not as senior as you thought. Those are the parts that nobody really likes to hear,

294
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:05,360
but the truth is what it is. This last point here is on less money. So if you're a senior

295
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,840
developer and you're helping advance your junior developers and you're getting to a point where

296
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,760
if you've got a senior developer here and a junior developer here, they should be moving to a

297
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,920
situation where they're becoming more of a peer. And this is, I think, should be one of the goals

298
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:26,000
for a senior developer. Now if someone shows up and says, oh, semi-junior developer, former

299
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,400
junior developer, I see you now become a senior developer and you're being paid X. I will pay you

300
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,800
1.5 X. Well, a lot of people are going to leave you in that situation. It's not personal. But if

301
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:43,520
someone shows up with a truck full of money, people may leave your organization. So regardless

302
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,120
of how good a job you're doing at helping your juniors advance or helping them, creating a

303
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,720
positive culture for you, if someone shows up and just throws bags of money at them, they're going

304
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,520
to leave. You don't take that personally. You've done your job as a senior well, if that happens.

305
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,280
Let me rephrase that. You have done your job well as a senior if you've had a more junior

306
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,760
developer join your organization, they have advanced their skills in your organization,

307
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,720
and then someone comes and throws a small bag of money at them and they're like, no,

308
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,720
I mean, that's cool, but I'm going to stay with my people because I've learned here, I've grown here,

309
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,160
I enjoy where I am. So for 1.1 X, I'm not going anywhere because I like my team, I like my people,

310
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:32,080
I know I'm going to get better here. 1.5 X, I might leave these people. 2 X, well, yeah,

311
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,400
you might have to go. If you've done your job really well as a senior developer,

312
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,840
your more junior developer advances, somebody offers them 2 X and they're like, okay, I'm leaving

313
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:51,760
and Andy's coming with me. We're both going to get 2 X. But these are, I think, things that

314
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,800
our more senior developers should be considering, partially to help improve the community culture,

315
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:04,000
but also these more junior developers are also people who are in that potential

316
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,040
contributor pipeline. So the more their skills advance, the more they're able to become,

317
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,200
the more likely they are to become potential contributors because they're already invested,

318
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,400
they already understand the value of Python because they're working in the field,

319
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,480
and they already feel like a part of the community. But as their skills advance,

320
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,720
they're better able to contribute, but then they are also able to become those people who are

321
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,720
closer to the senior end of the spectrum, who are more experienced developers, who are able to help

322
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,920
shape that community culture. So now instead of you being solo senior developer who's trying to

323
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,720
senior better, now you've brought along someone else, now you have another senior developer or

324
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,120
another more senior developer to help you with those things. So you ease the burden on yourself.

325
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:56,560
So instead of me just saying, you know, instead of me just saying, you know, senior better,

326
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:02,800
and you know, hey senior developers, get better, I tried to offer some, there's an idea that I have,

327
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,760
and this is something that I discussed with my own team. It's one of the reasons I talked about

328
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,200
my team so much earlier. One of the things that I discussed with my team, so I'm the newest member

329
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,360
at RevSys, and I am probably our least experienced developer. And so there's a lot of back and forth

330
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:22,800
as far as transferring information from my more experienced team members to myself. I mean, so I

331
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,960
have like a weekly meeting with our president just to sort of ask questions and, you know, discuss

332
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,720
things of that nature. One of the things, two things that have come up really, this solution

333
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,400
to an unknown problem. One of the things that junior developers often run into is that a senior

334
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:44,960
developer will say, okay, we're going to use this. We're going to use this tool and just, you know,

335
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,920
use it. I mean, the junior developer doesn't understand why. The reason the senior developer

336
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,560
is using that tool is because it is solving a problem that the senior developer has run into,

337
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:00,560
but the junior developer has never encountered. And so this point about junior versus senior,

338
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,640
the difference between, and this is the key difference between a senior developer and a

339
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:13,120
junior developer. That's the difference. A senior developer has bumped their head against problems

340
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,760
that a junior developer has never encountered. And at some point, they've bumped their head against

341
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,360
them enough where they've had to either devise a situation or devise a solution or find a solution

342
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,640
or come up with some set of processes. But the junior developer, having never seen that problem,

343
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,480
doesn't understand what this is or why. Why are we doing all this sort of extra complexity?

344
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,560
So simple, maybe not simple, but some of the more common or obvious examples would be things like

345
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,280
version control, like GIFs, like why do we need that? You know, why can't I just save my file in,

346
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:52,160
you know, like, you know, Kojo.py, you know, and then Kojo underscore 2.py and Kojo underscore 3.py,

347
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,160
like why, you know, and work for spreadsheets, you know, it works for other stuff. You know,

348
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,480
I got through college like that, you know, all of my papers, you know, like, you know, I have a

349
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,640
master's degree in English. I know all about Shakespeare. That worked for me there. If it's

350
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,600
good enough for Shakespeare, why isn't that good enough for you people? You know, why are you so

351
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:14,240
fancy? What's the deal? So version control is one example. Docker, a lot of us use Docker now

352
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,800
because it solves this issue of both dependency management and deployment. But as a more junior

353
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,320
engineer, you haven't had to face those problems. You haven't had to run into that sort of thing.

354
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,720
And so, again, just this issue of having bumped your head against things. This is one of the key

355
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,720
differences between a more senior developer and a more junior developer. And so I point this out

356
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,160
because I feel like, and this is the thing I talk about with my teammates, I feel like this idea of

357
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,440
understanding that you may be presented with a solution to a problem that you yourself haven't

358
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,480
encountered. By understanding that concept, you can start to look for, okay, well, what is that

359
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,880
problem? What is this thing that you bumped your head up against that I haven't that you're now

360
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,960
presenting with a solution for? And then this is something that definitely helps a more junior

361
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,040
developer become a more senior developer. And so maybe you don't have to bump your head against

362
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,600
that same thing as many times. But if someone else can explain to you, okay, look, if you go

363
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,280
that way, in our job, we're going to be going that way and out these doors a lot. You're going to

364
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,360
run into the door, the door's going to be locked. You're going to run into the door, the door's

365
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,200
going to be locked. What you need is something that will tell you if the door is locked before

366
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,040
you get to it and then you know to make an adjustment. But this idea of understanding

367
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,200
that there are solutions that you might be presented with, that are solutions to problems

368
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,760
you haven't encountered is something that can help a more junior developer move towards the

369
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,080
senior end of the spectrum. And then understanding, okay, understanding some of the different

370
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,760
permutations of that problem. Because inevitably, again, for those of us who work in software,

371
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,960
you know that software doesn't always work. Or a thing that works now might not work tomorrow

372
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,320
or next week or what have you. And so if you're presented with this solution that you don't really

373
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,240
fully understand, you don't even understand the problem it's addressing, when something goes wrong

374
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,600
with that solution, which inevitably it does, then you have no idea of how to debug that thing.

375
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Because it's solving a problem that you don't even know exists. So senior developers can use

376
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,320
this context to try to make things clearer to more junior developers as they're helping them

377
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,960
advance their skills. But more junior developers can begin to ask these questions and realize,

378
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:24,480
okay, we're using Playwright. I just watched Andy's tutorial on Playwright. It's an end-to-end

379
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:32,800
testing tool. Why are we doing this? Python has a unit test built in. Why aren't we just using that?

380
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:40,160
Or the PyTest library. Why are we installing this other library for testing when we already have

381
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:46,720
unit testing built in? So a junior developer asking these questions, and then a more senior

382
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,560
developer helping explain and provide this sort of context. This last point here is that advancing

383
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:58,240
skills is not equal to hand-holding. And I point that out because in my role as the deaf and North

384
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,800
American ambassador, and I'll get into some of the details about that. That's sort of the fun

385
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,840
part of the talk, hopefully, later. I've attended my own local meetup in Houston rather, but I've

386
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:15,760
also attended meetups in at least three different countries and in lots of different U.S. cities.

387
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,880
And I've seen lots of, I've seen and heard lots of things said. And one of the recurring things

388
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,320
that I've noticed is this idea of like, well, you know, like, you know, we need to hire senior

389
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:31,120
dads because I don't have time to hold anybody's hand. Well, one of the problems with that is

390
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,680
you have this situation of like, I need someone to, you know, I need entertainment for my kid's

391
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:46,880
birthday party. I hope Beyonce is available, the Taylor Swift. So one, they're probably not. Two,

392
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,720
if they were, like, do you have enough money for those people? And, you know, they'd probably rather

393
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,080
play some big venue than at your kid's birthday party. And then three, you're not really that

394
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,120
important. You know, you don't really need like a Beyonce or a Taylor Swift. What you just need is

395
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:08,640
someone who is competent. And so this, again, inspect this idea of senior developers and junior

396
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,480
developers and helping more junior developers advance their skills and improve their abilities.

397
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,760
So, but I've heard the language of hand-holding being used a lot as if like, well, it's going to

398
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,880
sort of slow me down. I don't have time to sort of teach somebody this or that or the other thing.

399
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,080
And, look, I'll just say this clearly. If you are in a situation where you have,

400
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,320
where you or your organization have always been able to find all the fully qualified software

401
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:38,560
engineers you want, fantastic. Ignore me. I'm just some, I'm just some, you know, weirdo just saying

402
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:44,080
weird stuff. But I have heard more than enough times, you know, the complaint about not being

403
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,400
able to find good developers, not being able to find enough developers. And I feel like this is

404
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:56,800
some of the solution. All right. So we have sort of ended the sort of the scolding portion of the

405
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,000
program where I tell you to do better. And I tell you to do better, one, because you should.

406
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:11,360
But really, by you, I mean we, because I'm including myself in that. But also because

407
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,160
I have been fortunate to meet a number of people throughout the Python community and the Django

408
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:24,240
communities who have made lots of contributions. And it's a lot of work. It's a lot of effort.

409
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,480
And a lot of these people have helped me directly and indirectly. And so at some point,

410
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,920
some of it is just sort of a personal thing of, okay, I've got friends and my friends are kind

411
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,320
of overloaded. Like developer burnout is a real thing. We often hear about how people who are

412
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,360
maintaining various open source packages that we all need and use and love are considering stopping

413
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,320
that work because it's just too much, you know, there's too much effort happening. And so at a

414
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,240
very personal level, like, I have friends who are being overloaded and burnt out and my friends

415
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:01,040
need help. And the people who can help my friends are other of my friends. And, you know, people in

416
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,680
this room and other members of the Python community. And so by doing this sort of thing,

417
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,520
we can, you know, make life better for the people who are making and building these tools for us.

418
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,720
But also we can make sure that these tools continue to be around. So things like

419
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,440
new Python releases or new Django releases or things like PyPI, which is just magic.

420
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,040
It's like a magic shopping list. Like, okay, I'm going to make a requirements.txt file. I'm

421
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,400
just going to type in all the things I want. I want this and I want that. I want this package.

422
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,400
I want that package. And then you just run your code and then just all the things you want just

423
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,840
magically show up on your computer or they just magically show up wherever you deployed stuff.

424
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,760
That's PyPI. That doesn't happen just because hopes and dreams. That happens because people

425
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,880
like Ed Urban and like Dustin Ingram who used to organize PyTexas and various other people like

426
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,440
actually make that happen. Put in the work and the effort to make that happen. But also

427
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,200
money is required. And the money doesn't just fall from the sky either. Someone has to go find the

428
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,520
money. So these are all these reasons that helping to grow this contributor base is important because

429
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,840
if we want to be able to continue to type our magical shopping lists of Python and have those

430
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,160
magical shopping lists be, you know, Amazon, your fulfillment in next day delivery is all fantastic

431
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:19,040
or Amazon now in two hours, PyPI is faster. And it makes you money. So if you're in a situation

432
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,880
where you're getting paid money to write Python, we need to protect these tools and these ecosystems

433
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,360
that allow us to do what we do and what we enjoy. So that's that section of the talk. The idea of

434
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,680
what are the things that we can do to try to grow the contributor base

435
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:44,400
from that perspective. Now the other side of that coin is that even if you are a more

436
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,040
senior developer and you don't think that you yourself, maybe you're not sure about getting

437
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,800
more involved in things, things of that nature, I feel like there are benefits to be had by

438
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,480
developers of all ranges, all skill and experience ranges from more senior to more junior or people

439
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,920
along the Python spectrum from programmers to software engineers. We can all benefit from

440
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,400
more community engagement. And so you can do it, as the bullet point says. So this hashtag

441
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,280
UNORMGT, this is what I call the North American Grand Tour. So this is what I have done as the

442
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,840
definite North American ambassador, speaking at conferences and while speaking at conferences,

443
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,240
speaking to those conference organizers about the idea that DjangoCon US can come to their city,

444
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,840
but it has also allowed me an opportunity to meet people, to meet Python developers from

445
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,640
all over the country, all over North America and in lots of other parts of the world.

446
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:46,080
It allows me to see what people are doing with Python. So I live in Houston. In Houston we have

447
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,240
the oil and gas industry and also the world's largest medical research center. But there are

448
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,440
lots of other places, lots of other industries in different parts of the country, different parts

449
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,640
of the world. People are doing all sorts of interesting things with Python in these different

450
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,680
places. And so my pitch here for this part of the talk is by being more actively engaged in the

451
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,160
community, by actually sort of getting out and meeting the other Pythonistas in other places,

452
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:15,600
you can find new opportunities, meet new friends, but also if you are looking to hire people,

453
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,400
if you're looking to hire, again back to the idea of it's hard to find quality senior engineers,

454
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,560
the truth of that statement is almost always that when someone says that we can't find good

455
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:33,360
developers, what it almost always means is I live here and I said to myself, I want a good developer.

456
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,520
I couldn't find any good developers. Well, yeah, they probably all don't live at your house or

457
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,680
they're not all in your city. They don't all come to your city's local Python meetup. But if you go

458
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:56,080
to different conferences, meet different people in different places, now you've expanded your

459
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,600
network, you can eat more food, which is always nice, and you can take your family places. That's

460
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:08,000
always cool and interesting. So by being more actively engaged in the community, you can expand

461
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:15,280
your scope and do different things. So I'm going to talk a little bit about some more operational

462
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,440
things here. I'm not going to just say just go do more stuff and then not try to help you.

463
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,240
When I said senior better, I was going to just say senior better and then just be like,

464
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,000
okay, well, good luck figuring that out. I tried to at least offer something that I felt would be

465
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,960
helpful. So here, how do I go about this? Where should you go? How do you make it work? What do

466
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,200
you do if your job's not going to reimburse you for it? So again, I work at RevSys. RevSys has

467
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,240
sponsored PyCon and DjangoCon for I don't know how many years. So when I go to those things,

468
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,800
I'm not worried about my company being reimbursing me. When I started the North American Grand Tour,

469
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,560
I was working for a different company and that wasn't the case. So I had to figure out something

470
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,360
I had to bump my head against some things of, okay, well, how do I as one person

471
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,240
funded a tour of North America out of my own pocket? How do I make that happen?

472
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,080
So I'm going to pass some of those lessons along to you. And so now we're getting into sort of the

473
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,520
free and loose part of the talk. So you go to the internet. I'm going to start with

474
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:21,760
talking about your local Python meetup. And so again, when I talk about sort of community

475
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,160
engagement, where to go, the first place, the first logical place to start is, you know,

476
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,760
does your city or town have a Python meetup? And if so, go to that meetup and meet those people

477
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,400
and talk to those people. Now, if you get to your local Python meetup and it turns out, oh, well,

478
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,560
yes, we have a Python meetup, but it's a Python meetup of senior Python developers who are really

479
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,840
only interested in hanging out with other senior Python developers. And I don't really feel like

480
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:51,520
this is, you know, a place for me. Well, then go to some other places and meet some other Python

481
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:59,520
easters. I would say of my circle of Python friends, a lot of them now aren't just in Houston.

482
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:05,600
You know, my circle of friends is people sort of all over their place. And, you know, and we all

483
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,840
have the internet. And so we can all talk to each other and stuff. And so that works out just fine.

484
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:18,320
But so that's the first place I would say go try your local Python meetup. See how that goes.

485
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,600
Another nice thing about that, especially if you are a newer Python developer, and I'm passing

486
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:28,400
these things along to people who may be already more senior developers. But I was talking to

487
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,040
Jeremy, one of the biotech organizers, about this. If you were in a situation where you are a more

488
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,560
senior developer and you're in a position to advise more junior developers, as far as how can

489
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,080
they advance their careers? How can they improve their skills? These are things you can pass along.

490
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,880
So, you know, making them aware of some of these different opportunities. So if your local Python

491
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,080
meetup, you know, maybe it's meeting your needs, maybe it's not. But it doesn't hurt to expand this

492
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:59,440
and try some other things. So what I would look at next would be the wide range of regional

493
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,760
conferences. And so this is where we're just going to go to the internet and start looking at stuff.

494
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:11,360
Let's see. So from, let me open a map here. And just from a very practical standpoint.

495
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:21,520
So we've had a number of different regional conferences that are available from a, and since

496
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,520
we're here at PyTexas, we're here in Austin, I'm going to sort of start basically, sort of

497
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:32,080
physically geographically. The two sort of physically closest to each other would be

498
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:38,640
the two physically closest conferences that one could attend. We have our PyColorado,

499
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,960
which happens in Denver. And I think there's only been one year of PyColorado. I was, I was,

500
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,240
I missed the first year. And then PyTennessee, which is in Nashville, which has happened for

501
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:57,200
many years. And so, let's see, here's a website for PyColorado. So PyColorado, PyTennessee,

502
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,000
PyOhio, also, not just physically close, but also a very high quality conference.

503
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
PyOhio has the distinction, has the distinction of being a free of charge conference. So that's

504
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,120
always nice. And so there are a number of different regional conferences that you can attend. These

505
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:21,840
regional conferences tend to be less expensive. So I'll note the comparison I'm making.

506
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,400
Sort of the gold standard, kind of what, like if you were going to go to a conference,

507
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,960
people often would think, I want to go like to PyCon, you know, PyCon US, or maybe, you know,

508
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:37,440
PyCon, EuroPython, or PyCon Australia, something like that. But those are larger undertakings and

509
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,160
can be, you know, maybe more difficult, more expensive to attend, just because of the larger

510
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,720
nature. But there are a number of different regional conferences that are easier to get to,

511
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,040
often less expensive, often smaller. They generally tend to happen over a weekend. And so you're not

512
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,520
worried about, you know, getting time off or getting vacation time or getting approval from

513
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,840
a boss. You can just go because, you know, it's a weekend. If you have a job where you can't just

514
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:07,040
do what you want on weekends, then that's its own separate problem. I don't know that I can help you

515
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:15,120
with that. I have advice I can offer you. I'll do that offline. But, you know, changes can be made

516
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,440
depending on your risk tolerance and what you want to do with your life. But the nice thing about a

517
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,920
lot of these regional conferences is that, again, they're on weekends. They're more accessible.

518
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:31,520
They're easier to attend. But you can also look at them from a standpoint of expanding your

519
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:37,280
career opportunities and what you want to do with Python and where you might want to live at some

520
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,400
point in the future. I know the past two years have been very strange. And, you know, no one

521
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:49,680
has gone anywhere because, you know, things. But if you, you know, so we're here in Texas now,

522
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,720
but maybe you are someone who, you know, went to college at the Ohio State University. Well,

523
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,600
that's where Pi Ohio is. It's on that campus. Or if you're someone who is considered, you know,

524
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:05,040
maybe you have family in Tennessee or I'm very much a matte person. So there's a lot of stuff

525
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:12,000
here. It's sort of south of the Great Lakes. So Pi Tennessee is here in Nashville. You know,

526
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,680
maybe you know people in Tennessee. Maybe you know people in Ohio. Maybe you'd like to know

527
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:25,680
people in Tennessee or Ohio. One thing that I've noted is like at Pi Tennessee and at Pi Ohio,

528
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,880
I've often met people from like from Indianapolis, from IndiePie and from Chippy, the Chicago Python

529
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:38,000
Meetup, and from just from different parts of the country. And so in addition to, let's say,

530
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,280
if you go to Pi Tennessee, in addition to meeting people from Nashville, you'll meet people from the

531
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,280
state of Tennessee, but also from other nearby regions that you might not encounter here in Texas.

532
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:54,400
And the same with Pi Colorado or Pi Cascades, which is an international conference which

533
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:01,840
rotates between the lovely cities of Vancouver and Portland and Seattle.

534
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,240
And so if you're someone who has considered visiting the Pacific Northwest or living in

535
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,400
the Pacific Northwest or looking at jobs in that area, attending one of those conferences

536
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:20,720
can be a good way to do that. So again, it's sort of like the gold standard of conferences that

537
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:26,160
people want to attend. Something like something like a PyCon, a PyCon US or DjangoCon US. But again,

538
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,760
those are larger, more expensive. From having done NORMGT, I can tell you that often

539
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,760
attending conferences, one of the biggest expenses is actually going to be your hotel. So there's a

540
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,360
conference ticket. So you've got a few things. You've got a conference ticket, and then you've

541
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:50,400
got travel, and then you have hotel, and then food. So depending on what you're doing, the hotel can

542
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,560
be the most expensive portion of that because, especially for something like PyCon, this year's

543
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:59,120
PyCon is slightly abbreviated because the development sprints are only going to be Monday and Tuesday.

544
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:06,240
Usually the PyCon US schedule is, it will start Wednesday and Thursday. You have tutorials those

545
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:11,600
two days. And then Friday, Saturday, Sunday is the main conference with the talks. And then Monday

546
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:17,120
through Thursday of the next week are the development sprints. The development sprints are a great thing

547
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:23,680
to attend because, again, if you're looking at advancing your skills, or if you're looking at

548
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,200
maybe not advancing your skills, but if you're someone who feels like, well, my skills are good

549
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,960
enough, but I would like to use those skills to contribute to Python more directly, the development

550
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,880
sprints are a great way to do that. And then you can actually meet those people who work on those

551
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,760
packages. You work on the core Python itself or core Django itself or the other packages and

552
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:47,280
applications that get used in those ecosystems. You can interact with those people, learn how

553
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,240
those contributions get made, learn what needs to be worked on, build those relationships. But

554
00:50:52,800 --> 00:51:00,000
that time frame I described from Wednesday of one week to Thursday of the next week is a lot of time

555
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:09,040
to stay in hotels. And hotels can be expensive. So if you look at the PyCon, the suggested PyCon US

556
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:16,720
hotels have sort of ranged in the $200 a night range. And if you're wanting to go to tutorials

557
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,360
and do that sort of thing from Wednesday one week to Thursday of the next week, it can be a lot of

558
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,600
money, especially if your company is not paying for it, if your company is not reimbursing it,

559
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:31,040
not reimbursing you for it. One of the things that I have done, and so there are a couple ways

560
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,960
to work around that. Let's say if you're looking at PyCon itself, PyCon US itself, one approach

561
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:44,640
is to just go for the talk days, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or maybe just go for the

562
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,080
development sprint days. The nice thing about the development sprint at PyCon US is that they're

563
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:54,080
free of charge. And so you don't have to even buy a ticket for those. And so you can go to those.

564
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:59,520
But again, even if you were going to go to the development sprints, there's still the travel cost

565
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:05,200
and then you have to live somewhere. So that wasn't cost. One of the things that I've done

566
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,120
on the North American Grand Tour is I've gotten good at sort of finding cheaper hotels.

567
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:19,760
So there's this choice group of hotels and the Wyndham group of hotels, and they've got a range

568
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:26,000
of different hotels at different prices. Now, I will point this out that traveling is a

569
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:34,960
multivariate problem. And so there are things that I, as a 6'5", very heavy, large African

570
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,640
American man, I can go a lot of places by myself and it's fine. I'm not worried about my safety.

571
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,920
Now, there are other places. So let's see. If you look at my coworkers, so this is Repsys,

572
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,160
this is my team, and there's eight of us. So there's Catherine, the aforementioned Catherine.

573
00:52:51,200 --> 00:53:00,880
So Lacey is one of my coworkers, a former DjangoCon US chair. Lacey is maybe 5'2".

574
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:08,960
So Lacey, a much smaller female. And so there are places where I'm comfortable going by myself

575
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:15,760
that maybe Lacey might not want to go by herself. And so the details as far as how you travel and

576
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,000
when and where you travel will vary based on your individual preferences and risk tolerances and

577
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,120
that sort of thing. I can tell you, as someone who has been in some less expensive hotels in

578
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:29,280
places that might have seemed like, oh, this could be questionable, it has, for the most part,

579
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:38,560
been fine. It has 100% of the time been fine. But again, I recognize that I am me and people who

580
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:45,200
might want to behave in antisocial ways, shall we say, might want to do that elsewhere. Because

581
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,080
if you present yourself to me as a problem, you might now find that you have a larger problem

582
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:55,920
than you wanted. So that's just sort of some of the reality of me. So I will tell you this,

583
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,880
for PyCon US, I'm actually going to PyCon US this year. And since I knew I'd be giving this

584
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,560
talk and I'd be telling people, hey, go to conferences, it's fantastic. I wanted to sort

585
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:13,600
of walk it like I talk it. So what I would have done if my company wasn't reimbursing me for some

586
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:19,360
of the PyCon expenses, I would have had to try to find a less expensive hotel. And so what I

587
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:25,920
actually did is I'm going early to PyCon. I'm going to, so I came, so that's kind of why the

588
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:33,040
search is here. I came to this choice hotel site, looked for this in Salt Lake City. I am arriving,

589
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:39,200
I'm arriving on the 26th. I'm arriving on the 26th because I wasn't, I booked, I made my travel

590
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,600
reservations before the tutorials schedule was released. So I didn't know if I was going to want

591
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:48,160
to go to tutorials or not. And so I, but I wanted to be able to go to tutorials. So I'm arriving on

592
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:53,920
the 26th and then I'm moving to the conference hotels, which are more expensive, which my company

593
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,720
has been reimbursing me for. I'm going to check out of my cheaper hotel on the 28th and then move

594
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:04,560
into the conference hotel that Thursday evening. So I can be in the conference hotel for the talks

595
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:09,680
Friday, Saturday, Sunday. And then Monday I'm going to leave my conference, leave the conference hotel

596
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:15,920
and move back to a cheaper hotel. And so, so this is what I did. This is literally what I did. I'm

597
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:23,920
not signing up. And so we've got hotels near Salt Lake City. I think I have them sorted by price.

598
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,080
Yeah, sorted by price, low to high. So these are the cheaper ones. This one I looked at and I was

599
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:34,960
like, hmm, like this is like 9.7 miles from destination. That seems like, from my experience,

600
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:41,600
that seems like it could be far. So if we go to Salt Lake City,

601
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,920
and actually what we really want is the Salt Palace, which is the convention center.

602
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,480
So here's the Salt Palace. And again, I have done this tour of the continent. So I have more map stuff

603
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:06,320
in my head than most people probably should. But in looking at these, I saw, okay, this address,

604
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:12,800
South 300, which is nine miles from the destination. I saw 715 West North Temple Street. And so from

605
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,160
looking at the maps, I know that West North Temple is near the conference center. And so,

606
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,360
was it, yeah, North Temple is near the conference center. So here is,

607
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,440
so here's the conference center. Here's South Temple Street.

608
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,600
Here's North Temple Street. So we've got, okay, a few blocks, North Temple Street, a few blocks

609
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:36,880
north of the convention center. So let's take this address,

610
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:42,400
put it into Google Maps, and see what it tells us.

611
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:57,520
And it's 1.2 miles from the venue. And there's a lot of Google mapping that gets done. So if you are

612
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:05,440
price sensitive, then there's a little more research time that needs to go in. But again,

613
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:11,440
this is literally how I've attended many different conferences around the world. I use this same

614
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,600
process when I attended PyCon Australia. This is how I found my hotel for PyCon Australia.

615
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:22,320
That was a little iffy. I ended up living on top of a karaoke bar, which was, you know,

616
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:27,920
was exciting, but maybe, you know, but I also learned by being there that there was another

617
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,800
sort of nicer hotel. This is like a block away. So maybe I'll stay there next time.

618
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:41,520
Next time I'm in Sydney. But so we have here, so this hotel is the train, the Green Line train,

619
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:46,400
which is also the train that takes you from Salt Lake City Airport to the conference location.

620
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,640
But this Green Line train will take you from that cheap hotel to the venue in 15 minutes.

621
00:57:53,520 --> 00:58:02,000
And that hotel is even now still $61 a night, as opposed to like $200 or $220 for the hotels that

622
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,920
are very close to the conference, that are attached to the conference. So this is where I'll be

623
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,080
Tuesday and Wednesday night, checking out Thursday morning, then I'll be back here

624
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:19,600
Monday evening, and then leaving from there Tuesday. So at some point, there's like,

625
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:25,440
okay, hold on, we came to Pie, Texas, not to like travel planet, Texas, or, you know, this is,

626
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,600
it suddenly turned into an episode of like House Hunters, House Hunters International,

627
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:36,960
which is a good show. I mean, it's not a bad place to end up. But again, back to the idea of,

628
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:41,360
if I'm going to say, well, hey, just, you know, do all these cool things.

629
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:46,720
Yeah, I mean, well, yeah, it's fantastic. If you are, you know, if you have all the

630
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,360
monies in the world, or, you know, again, I work for a company now that sponsors PyCon,

631
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:56,320
sponsors DjangoCon, I'm not worried about these expenses being reimbursed. That wasn't always the

632
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:00,720
case. So I started speaking at Python conferences when I still worked as an accountant. And so I

633
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,520
was definitely, you know, footing the bill for that stuff myself. And then even in my first

634
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:09,200
developer job, I was still having to, you know, deal with these costs out of pocket. And so again,

635
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:16,560
like, just to put a very fine point on it, like, if you are thinking, if you were thinking about

636
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:22,880
going to PyCon US this year, I'm 99% sure PyCon US is not sold out already. I think we talked

637
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,840
about that last night. So you can still get a ticket to PyCon US, and you can stay at this

638
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:35,680
$61 a night hotel. And again, I've stayed at Econologies. I'm sure it'll be fine. Again,

639
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:42,640
for me personally, it'll be fine. You can also come and stay here too. I'll be there. And so

640
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,840
it's like 95% chance it'll be fine for you too, you know. Because if nothing else, you know,

641
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:57,520
I'll be there for at least a few of the nights. So to try to provide some actual practical,

642
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,280
actionable advice, it's like, well, if you were thinking about going to PyCon, but maybe you don't

643
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:05,440
know if your company will pay for it or your company would reimburse you for it, well, this is

644
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,360
a less expensive option. There's still the cost of the ticket. There's still the cost of airfare.

645
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:15,920
I can't make those measures go away. Food is a thing that you can, you can vary your food pricing.

646
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:26,720
But, you know, let's see, PyCon Cleveland, I stayed in the 2018, the 2018 PyCon Cleveland.

647
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,720
It was the first PyCon Cleveland. I ended up being in Cleveland for like a week and a half,

648
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:36,400
maybe longer, because I did training in Chicago for a thing. And then I came from Chicago to

649
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,160
Cleveland. I got to Cleveland like Sunday night. And so I was in Cleveland from like Sunday of one

650
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:46,880
week until like Wednesday of the next week. But I was staying at a hotel like this. And so even

651
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,720
though it was mostly coming out of my pocket, and I got reimbursed for some of it, but those costs

652
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:56,960
that had to be reimbursed weren't outlandish. So again, trying to offer some sort of practical

653
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:02,560
advice here. So there are so many choices. PyTennessee is only one of them. There are many

654
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:13,520
other conferences that you can look at. So in conclusion, I know this talk was kind of

655
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:18,880
four different small talks together, tied together with this one cohesive thread.

656
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:26,560
Hopefully the cohesive thread was that we need as many new contributors as possible

657
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:31,440
in our community, because there's lots of work to be done. And the amount of work that needs to be

658
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:37,680
done grows as Python becomes more popular. My concern is that Python's popularity and use

659
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:43,680
is growing at one rate, but the contributor base is growing at a slower rate. And so trying to

660
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,960
make a graph in person. So trying to make this line, this bottom line, so to come closer to

661
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:58,880
this one, that's the goal. So who needs graphs on slides? You have hands. Why would you do that?

662
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:05,840
So again, trying to include as many, trying to add as many new contributors as possible,

663
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,840
but again, only actual community members will contribute, people who actually feel like the

664
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:15,520
members of the community. And our current senior devs are the ones that have this outsize influence

665
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:20,880
on our community. And so it's sort of an appeal to those more senior developers to recognize that

666
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:25,760
with this impact on the community, there's more responsibility. As Spider-Man taught us, with great

667
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:33,680
power comes great responsibility. Also radioactive something something. Again, those developers help

668
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:40,640
shape our community and focusing on training and retaining the developers who are here that you

669
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:45,280
work with is an important thing. And also you go out, make new friends, meet new people, see new stuff.

670
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:50,240
If you have any questions or comments, things of that nature, this is me on Twitter. This is probably

671
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:54,400
the best way to reach me to reach out if you have feedback. Again, this is kind of a talk I've been

672
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,520
working on since 2013 and you know, I'll get new feedback and new information and we'll update it

673
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:05,760
and add it into some part of another talk. But that is my presentation. So hopefully it has been

674
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,080
of some benefit to you and has been to quality. So thank you all very much for your time.

675
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:15,840
you
