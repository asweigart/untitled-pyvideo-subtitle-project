1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Okay. So, every year, we kind of like to look back and talk a little bit about how PyTex

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,400
got to where it is. And this year, there were a lot of first time speakers, so maybe you

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,480
haven't seen this talk, although I've given it in the past. So, I wanted to kind of walk

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,360
through this. The title of this is Making PyTex Happen Legally, because for the first

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,840
few years, it was a little sketchy, questionable at least. So, here's just a little history

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:46,720
about how PyTex came around. The first PyTex-ish meetup was in Houston in 2007. It might be

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:53,520
the first regional conference. There's some historical references to some others. You

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,120
kind of go spelunking on the web right around that time, but it's right around the right

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:06,280
time. We adopted the PyTex's name in 2009, and for a long time there, it was a super

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:13,120
informal just get together like at a friendly venue, a college campus or something. No food,

11
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:23,480
no sponsors, just Southwestern Medical Center, Baylor. That was 2009. Okay. Sheila, by the

12
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:30,520
way, is responsible for a large portion of these earlier meetups. So, thank you, Sheila.

13
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:42,920
I appreciate it. So, in 2013, we were facing a problem which was people would say they

14
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,400
were going to come. We would start to get food, and then they wouldn't show up, and

15
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,560
that was kind of difficult. So, we started asking people to pay, because that makes people

16
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,760
make it. And Sheila was kind of stepping away, so more of us kind of stepped in for the first

17
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:03,640
time. The problem was we were taking in money to do things, but who was that money going to? Is

18
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:11,320
it Jeremy's money or somebody else's? And also, so there are tax liabilities, and also if we tell

19
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,640
a sponsor we're going to do something, who's the responsible party for it? So, taking on kind of a

20
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:24,360
lot of legal liabilities and risks. So, we kind of asked for help, and the PSF stepped up, and they

21
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,840
helped us by taking in payments from sponsors or from individuals who were buying tickets, and then

22
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,800
sending us reimbursement, which was really helpful. We're really glad that they did it,

23
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,040
but there was just a little bit of friction with that process, because we would have to kind of

24
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,800
pay money out and then wait to be reimbursed, and it was sort of a pain. So, we decided to do it

25
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:54,520
ourselves, and in I think 2014, we incorporated as a Texas nonprofit, the Pi Texas Foundation has

26
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:02,280
been around now for about eight years, and we went and got like 501c3 certification, which means if

27
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,920
you donate money to us, that's actually tax deductible, which is nice, and just FYI, our

28
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,840
bylaws state that like this is kind of an essential thing you have to do to do this, but like if we

29
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,080
ever dissolve any money that's left over, it all goes to the PSF. So, it's a fully Python dedicated

30
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,480
organization, and we got a logo, which we love, and which the PSF's like trademark board has

31
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:32,600
actually approved, which is nice. So, this is, you know, Pi Texas generally. So, stepping back in,

32
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:42,560
we started the foundation in 2014, got our 501c3 certification, had a couple of little oopsies in

33
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,400
2018, and then, you know, 21, where maybe we got a little busy and didn't quite do it, or, you know,

34
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:57,760
had a worldwide pandemic, and now we're in 2022. So, that's just kind of how we are. That means

35
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:11,760
that this is something like our 15-year anniversary, which is kind of cool. So, how are we, how is the

36
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,800
Pi Texas Foundation work? Like, what do we do? We have a board of directors. There are three of us.

37
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:27,560
As of yesterday, Mason Egger is our new president. Thank you, Mason, for joining us. Huge mistake,

38
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:36,240
but anyway. Kevin is, I think, maybe outside. No, Kevin's over here. Kevin's the vice president.

39
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,520
I'm the secretary. We don't have a treasurer right now. I just get to do that for fun. And then,

40
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,920
we have kind of committees, special committees, who are selected to run the conference,

41
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,400
effectively just giving them the power to sign contracts when we need them to. And then,

42
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,800
we have meetings every six months or so in order to check in on the finances and stuff. It's

43
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,640
actually kind of boring. So, if you want to help, do a boring thing, but that also is really,

44
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:09,760
really important for the longevity of Pi Texas and its legal status and keeping the things going,

45
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,200
and then thinking, helping us think about potential expansion options, you could become a director.

46
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,160
You could help us out. How do you do that? Let us know you want to do it. Come to the meetings.

47
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:31,280
Really, that's it. It's not a lot, but if you do it, it really is helpful for us to be able to push

48
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:38,800
some of these responsibilities out to others and also get ideas. There are different areas of

49
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,720
Texas that we maybe don't serve as well as we would like to, and so we'd love to have

50
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:53,760
more input on those kinds of things. What's that? Yeah, because the directors right now,

51
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,560
until yesterday, we were in Dallas, Austin, and Houston, so they've always been sort of virtual.

52
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,720
The actual requirement officially in our bylaws is that we have to meet at the conference. So,

53
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,720
when there's a conference, we have an annual meeting just to do it. Anyhow,

54
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:19,760
we can always do off-cycle meetings too, but yeah, they are virtual. Anyhow, I think that's

55
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,440
please come let me know if you're interested. Super happy to talk about that more.

56
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,360
One last thing is there's always some confusion. There's Pi Texas Foundation, which is ongoing

57
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,720
and a persistent entity where we have yearly obligations or all-year obligations, and then

58
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,920
there's the Pi Texas Conference, which is what we're here at today. Anyhow, we're thinking about

59
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:53,440
ways to increase the influence of the Pi Texas Foundation beyond the yearly conference, but

60
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,560
for now, this is what we've got in the Pi Texas. With that, I think that's the history. I'm all

61
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:15,440
done. Any questions, any thoughts? All right, cool. Who's next up? All right, awesome. Thanks,

62
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,440
y'all.
