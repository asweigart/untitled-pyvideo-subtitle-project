1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,240
My name is Laura Santorin, I am a developer advocate at PinguLumi.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,360
We are an infrastructure as code company, but it's also my first time here at PyTexas.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,760
How many other people here is your first time here at PyTexas?

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,760
Don't be shy, raise your hand, nice and high.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,760
Isn't it exciting to be here?

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,760
Y'all excited?

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,760
Are y'all awake after lunch?

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
No.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,600
Maybe not.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:35,040
Alright, well I'm just gonna kinda get started here.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,660
We're gonna be talking a little bit about building a scientific computing lab on public

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,660
clouds.

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,040
Now how many people here have ever used a public cloud?

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,120
Alright, alright.

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,640
So we have some people who have, some people who haven't, basically my job right now is

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,680
teach people about public cloud,

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,320
but I used to actually study real clouds.

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,400
So there are clouds, and then there are clouds.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,800
Clouds are the ones in the sky.

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,520
My degree is actually in Earth and Atmospheric Science.

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,760
How many people here do not have a degree

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,000
in computer science?

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,180
I promise you, you are not alone.

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,640
So I also have my degree in Earth and Atmospheric Science.

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,400
I spend a lot of time actually doing science research

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,400
on weather, and I did a lot of teaching about weather,

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,080
and I will say the most intimidating thing

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,400
is trying to give a live weather demo

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
to a bunch of eight-year-olds.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,280
Just so that you know, that's probably

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,360
the most intimidating thing to do.

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,400
But I used to study those clouds that are up there,

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,940
and now I study cloud computing.

34
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,020
So I get to teach about those now.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,520
One thing that we're going to find out today,

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,480
because I get to talk about science today,

37
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,320
in just cloud computing, is that communication is important.

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,800
When it came to actual professional science,

39
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,360
one of the most important things

40
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,080
that you need to be able to do

41
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,320
is share what you've learned

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,960
in a way that's understandable to other people,

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,940
that they can repeat that without necessarily talking to you

44
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,360
and get the same result.

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,920
So, that being said, now that I am no longer

46
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,440
a scientist exactly, we can start talking

47
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,440
about citizen science.

48
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,600
It's lovely to get a chance to explore

49
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,880
all of these data sets yourself.

50
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,280
And there's a lot you can do on your own.

51
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,600
However, there's some stuff you can't actually do

52
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,440
because you don't have the same tools at your disposal.

53
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,200
Generally, science data analysis

54
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,760
is extremely hardware intensive.

55
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,880
Most big research organizations have their own computing.

56
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,120
They have people who run this for you.

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,760
They have people who build it for you and set it all up.

58
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,840
Unfortunately, that kind of hardware is expensive.

59
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,760
So, for the average person trying

60
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,800
to do some citizen science,

61
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,560
it's too expensive to run on your own.

62
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,480
In addition, if you're trying to run it locally

63
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,000
on your machine, it takes a really long time.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,480
Now, I don't know about all of you,

65
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,600
but I generally don't have a ton of time outside of work

66
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,760
to sit and wait for a data set to run.

67
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,800
Does anybody here have that time?

68
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,960
And if so, tell me your secrets.

69
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,040
How are you more able to do that outside of work?

70
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,440
Unfortunately, I'm not.

71
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,080
I don't know about anybody else.

72
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,440
The other thing, though, is that because we are not sure

73
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,680
what other citizen scientists have available,

74
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,160
it's really hard to repeat it locally on your machine.

75
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,960
We all know that, hey, it works on my machine, right?

76
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,560
How many people have said that?

77
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,720
I've definitely said that before.

78
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,040
But generally, when it comes to actual citizen science,

79
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,800
you do run into that case where you say

80
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,480
it works on your machine, but it's really hard

81
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,880
to replicate on someone else's.

82
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,040
So, how do we solve that?

83
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,280
You might be able to guess.

84
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,000
Anybody have a guess?

85
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,920
Public Clouds.

86
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,240
Public Clouds, that's right.

87
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,040
Yay, cloud computing.

88
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,080
So, the wonderful thing about the cloud

89
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,800
is that there's a lot of options out there.

90
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,520
It gives us the ability to do a lot of hardware intensive

91
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,440
stuff and make that more accessible to the average person.

92
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,360
There is a slight, slight problem, though.

93
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,960
Does anybody know what all these are?

94
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,640
Can anybody name every single one of those?

95
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,280
I can't, just so you know, if I do this all day long.

96
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,080
There's almost too many options, and nothing makes sense.

97
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,640
Now, some clouds are really great at naming things

98
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,440
in reasonable ways.

99
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,880
Google Cloud does BigQuery.

100
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,520
What does BigQuery do?

101
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,520
Query data, yes!

102
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,720
Some clouds, though, don't do great at naming things.

103
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,480
Name with AWS.

104
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,480
It's notorious for code names on all of its products.

105
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,600
There is a lovely video out there,

106
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,240
if you've ever seen Forest Brazil's video,

107
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,920
where he does a music video trying to name

108
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,960
every single AWS product in about two minutes.

109
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,760
It is a great video, please go watch it.

110
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,960
You should check that out.

111
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,520
And that's just some things

112
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
that all of these cloud systems have.

113
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,120
This is only the data stuff, by the way.

114
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,440
There's hundreds of thousands of other products

115
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,560
on each of these catalogs,

116
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,120
and it's so much to try and understand.

117
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,240
If you're looking for Apache Beam,

118
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,200
which is something that you actually use a lot

119
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,200
in data science, it's not called Apache Beam

120
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,720
on every single cloud.

121
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,960
In fact, every cloud has a different name for it.

122
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Dataflow for GCP, Kinesis Data, and Analytics for AWS.

123
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,480
I honestly don't know what it is on Azure,

124
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,720
and I shouldn't, but you get the idea.

125
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,360
So this is a little bit of a problem.

126
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,800
How do we solve this?

127
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,560
Well, this is why infrastructure is code

128
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,640
is extremely useful, especially for citizen science.

129
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,880
Part of it is that you can actually go look at the API

130
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,180
and start to understand what are those products?

131
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,760
What do they do?

132
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,100
Oh hey, that one looks like this one.

133
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,120
Wait a minute, it is the same thing,

134
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,160
it's just renamed a different way.

135
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,440
IHC ensures that you have infrastructure

136
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,280
that is repeatable, reusable, and replicable.

137
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,680
Meaning, you yourself can always repeat

138
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,040
and bring up the same infrastructure every single time

139
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,900
and get the same result.

140
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,440
You can reuse it wherever you are,

141
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,040
and you can ensure that someone else you work with

142
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,000
can actually replicate what you're doing,

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,520
which is really great when you're doing citizen science

144
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,680
and data analysis.

145
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,560
Now, you can also move from cloud to cloud as needed.

146
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,180
Should you realize, for example,

147
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,440
that you've kind of gone over your free tier on one cloud,

148
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,040
you can just hop over to a free tier on another one.

149
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,240
Shh, I didn't actually say that.

150
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,840
If you actually work at AWS, don't be upset with me.

151
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,240
So, there are quite a few options out there

152
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,680
for actually doing infrastructure as code.

153
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,960
Today's demo is going to use Pulumi.

154
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,560
I'm sorry, it's because I work there,

155
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,280
that's what I know, it's also open source,

156
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,120
but there are a lot of other options out there.

157
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,240
There's Terraform, each of the cloud providers

158
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,000
have their own SDK, and you can actually do all of this

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
with Python, which is the fun part.

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,800
The important thing to understand is that using SDKs

161
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,160
and hitting these APIs with infrastructure as code

162
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,800
ensures that, again, it's repeatable, reusable,

163
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,640
and a replicable experience for other citizen scientists.

164
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,520
One of the harder things about working with cloud computing

165
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,480
is deciphering that massive catalog.

166
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,800
How do you decide what to use?

167
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,560
It's not always a great idea to basically rent a VM

168
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,840
and just run your code on it.

169
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
That's expensive, you're gonna pay a lot of money for it.

170
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,840
All of that storage takes a lot of power,

171
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,200
and therefore a lot of money.

172
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,200
So there's a lot of other options and optimizations

173
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,040
you can do to take advantage of each cloud's strengths.

174
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,480
Today, we're gonna use GCP, just because one, I like it,

175
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,680
two, the names actually make sense,

176
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,320
so when we talk about it, it's gonna make sense

177
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,160
to everybody.

178
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,400
And also, generally, it's actually pretty good

179
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,880
for data analysis, so we'll be using that today.

180
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,440
We are gonna make some compromises on choice, though,

181
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,160
because I want this to be accessible to everyone.

182
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,240
We will not be using Dataflow or Apache V.

183
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,120
I'm just gonna be running a serverless function,

184
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,080
we're gonna take a look at some data from there.

185
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,080
Again, repeatable, reusable, replicable,

186
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,080
and understandable for everyone to use.

187
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
But there's one more thing about citizen science

188
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,960
that you need.

189
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,840
It's great if you have all this computing power

190
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,400
and you know what code you're gonna run and all that,

191
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,640
but what are we missing?

192
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,760
Data, that's right.

193
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,520
So, where should we get your data?

194
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,800
One of the lovely things about all of these

195
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,280
various public clouds is that they've actually uploaded

196
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,280
a lot of the public data sets from various agencies,

197
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,120
including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

198
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,080
Administration, which is NOAA, the National Weather Service,

199
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,760
and also Sphere Weather Data.

200
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,800
So, they pull all of that in.

201
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,080
You no longer have to pay for all of that storage,

202
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,560
which is actually pretty fantastic.

203
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,520
They host it for free, so you can analyze

204
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,920
the data yourself.

205
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,960
You don't pay for ingress ingress,

206
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,440
all of these various things typically have to pay for

207
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,080
with infrastructure.

208
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,200
So, we're gonna take advantage of that today.

209
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,560
But, what question are we solving today?

210
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Well, March 25th, generally in Austin, Texas.

211
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,480
How many people were following the news

212
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,960
over the past two weeks?

213
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,920
I see like three of you.

214
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,200
Y'all, come on.

215
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,880
All right, what typically happens on March 25th in Austin?

216
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,560
This weather related, I'm not talking basketball.

217
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,840
Hail, that's right.

218
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,680
I don't know if anybody saw it, but there's like,

219
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,000
it's all over Reddit, all over the news.

220
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,880
March 25th, go cover your car.

221
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,000
Quick, put it in the garage.

222
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,560
I mean, yesterday was pretty sunny if you ask me.

223
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,200
But, we're gonna take a look and see,

224
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,680
is it true that March 25th is historically

225
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,040
the most likely chance for hail?

226
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,080
And with that being said, let's go look at some code.

227
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,040
Okay, can everybody in the back see that?

228
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,880
Yes.

229
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,680
Yes, I see thumbs up, so we are in good shape.

230
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,240
So, let's take a look at what we're taking a look at here.

231
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,960
Because I can't do this without actually

232
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,800
looking over my shoulder.

233
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm gonna look with all of you.

234
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,920
So, let's just scroll up a little bit.

235
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Here we go, hey, look.

236
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,080
Okay, so we're doing a little bit of the same thing

237
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,680
Okay, so we're doing a little bit of importing here.

238
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,040
Mainly the big thing is, you can take a look

239
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,120
at the secrets in the importing string.

240
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,560
That's just mostly for line 10,

241
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,720
which is giving me some random string

242
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,120
that I'm appending to my job.

243
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,960
The reason we do that is because otherwise

244
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,520
we're gonna get collisions when we push stuff up

245
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,680
if there's already code running there.

246
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,560
So, that's just something to keep in mind.

247
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,000
Random strings are helpful for naming

248
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,280
to ensure that when you actually run all of this

249
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,000
regularly, you never actually overwrite

250
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,680
something you already have.

251
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,360
This is something that you see pretty commonly

252
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,040
in infrastructure as code.

253
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,040
Now, this line seven is actually pulling in

254
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,160
my little SQL query.

255
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,200
There we go, that's not highlighted anymore.

256
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,040
I like to put my SQL query in a different file

257
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,400
just because it's a little bit easier for me to modify

258
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,080
and keep under source control.

259
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,040
So, you'll get a chance to see that.

260
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,040
Generally, what we're doing on this round

261
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,640
is we are pulling from the severe weather dataset.

262
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,320
We are pulling every year from 1950 on forward.

263
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,680
And we're gonna run against that

264
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,320
and just look for the event date that it started.

265
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,120
Is it actually a hail event?

266
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,600
And did it happen here in Travis County?

267
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,160
So, those are three big things

268
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,960
that we're actually pulling down.

269
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,880
Oh, did it happen in March?

270
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Because we're gonna narrow this all down.

271
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,560
And now we get to the actual infrastructure.

272
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,160
Again, this is all written in Python,

273
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,160
so should be fairly simple to read

274
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,320
in comparison to other languages.

275
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,760
I've been stuck in TypeScript lately,

276
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,400
so I'm much happier being back in Python all over again.

277
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,240
But a couple things to keep in mind

278
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,520
when we actually take a look at any infrastructure as code

279
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,920
is that you are looking at, in this case,

280
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,400
a declarative piece of code.

281
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,320
I like to call it desired state.

282
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,160
We're basically passing this up to the cloud

283
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,360
and saying, hey, hit the same key on it

284
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,640
and give me exactly what I've asked for.

285
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,440
So, in this case, we've got a bucket, which is storage,

286
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,880
a bucket object, which is just the file that's in storage.

287
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,440
We have another storage bucket.

288
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,680
The reason we have two is one has code,

289
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,720
that's why it's called code bucket.

290
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,760
And then I have my dataset, which is what?

291
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,640
My data, that's right, okay.

292
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,440
Just making sure you all are awake.

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,680
Let me have our actual BigQuery dataset here.

294
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,560
Again, this is just a little test dataset

295
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,240
that I have just to store the data

296
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,760
that I'm actually gonna be querying,

297
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,560
which we'll then pull out to use for a cloud function.

298
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,000
That's why it's just called foo and bar.

299
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,880
Then we have two jobs.

300
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,040
The jobs themselves are the important thing

301
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,680
for the actual query.

302
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,600
The first one is a query job,

303
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,040
because if you look on line 47,

304
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,840
yes, I can see that upside down.

305
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,520
If you look at line 47, what does it say?

306
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,320
Query, that means it's a query job.

307
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,760
The next one down,

308
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,720
and you can see we actually have that secure storage data,

309
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,640
the next one down is our export job.

310
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,800
And the export job just takes that data

311
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,080
that we were actually gonna run

312
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,760
from the query from the table

313
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,600
and dumps it in my storage bucket for just a minute

314
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,440
while my cloud function actually is gonna run

315
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,000
and pull that data out.

316
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,920
And then it comes out as a CSV,

317
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,960
because we're gonna also be using pandas,

318
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,040
like the last speaker,

319
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,840
who brought that up in the very first part,

320
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,280
so I guess he didn't really use it in the end,

321
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,440
but it's there as well.

322
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,680
And then we have our function to analyze some data.

323
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,440
You'll note that I'm running an old Python 3.9,

324
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,640
and we are here in the central region for GCP.

325
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,760
So just a couple of little things here.

326
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,000
This storage URL is the important part

327
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,800
that tells us where the data's gonna be living.

328
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,440
And okay, one more thing about infrastructure just to know

329
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,920
is that unlike running it on your local machine,

330
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,440
you have to have permissions.

331
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,560
So you have to have a little system that says,

332
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,760
hey, this user's actually allowed you

333
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,920
to do what it's actually doing.

334
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,880
If you don't do this,

335
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,160
someone's gonna be able to hack into your entire system

336
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,840
and do everything that they wanna do.

337
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,520
So maybe that part's kind of important to mention.

338
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,360
Just a little bit.

339
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,400
At the end, we're actually gonna see,

340
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,240
when we run the code,

341
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,960
we'll get a chance to actually see the variables.

342
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,880
Let's go take a look at the app real quick.

343
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,240
Again, I decided not to,

344
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,880
can you all read that in the back?

345
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,000
Bigger.

346
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,840
Bigger?

347
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,680
Okay, hold on.

348
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,520
Put the mic down.

349
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,480
Better?

350
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,680
Excellent.

351
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,680
All right, so this is actually a fairly small analysis.

352
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,920
I'm not going through a big one

353
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,960
because it's gonna take too much time,

354
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,080
unfortunately, to actually run it.

355
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,600
But we are just gonna go through, pull in our data,

356
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,120
and we're gonna just grab the CSV,

357
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,920
do a little bit of parsing on there,

358
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,600
get my date time in the right format there on line 13.

359
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,880
We're gonna append it all to one data frame,

360
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,920
and then we're going to actually plot it

361
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,480
starting on line 20.

362
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,680
Let's go.

363
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,920
And one thing to note,

364
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,680
they don't really explain this about plot functions.

365
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,120
It's running Flask in the background

366
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,720
if you're running Python.

367
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,080
So even though I'm not actually recording this,

368
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,200
and if you go actually run the code yourself

369
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,800
on your local machine and try to do it yourself,

370
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,800
you'll see that I'm not actually installing Flask

371
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,080
in the requirements.

372
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,000
So that's only because it's already there

373
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,840
on the plot functions,

374
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,840
and I'm not really sure they really documented that.

375
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,160
But all that being said, y'all ready to see how this works?

376
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,760
Woo-woo, woo-woo.

377
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,560
All right, pray for the demo gods.

378
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,840
Because I'm doing this live.

379
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,560
I have not run anything.

380
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,120
Blimey, yeah.

381
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,040
Here we go.

382
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,240
Maybe.

383
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,600
Up here.

384
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,200
No, it's up here.

385
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,840
Hey, Bloopy, what are you doing?

386
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,600
Oh, I know what I did.

387
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,320
Here we are.

388
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,720
How many people just kind of go up and hit this?

389
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,440
No action taken.

390
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,040
What are you doing, Bloopy?

391
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,000
For some reason, it's deciding that I have to run.

392
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,240
Let me figure out what on earth it's doing.

393
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,160
Normally, what this would actually do

394
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,120
is show you all kinds of lovely information.

395
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,840
I wonder if I can actually run it

396
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,640
in this one specific one.

397
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,120
But let me run it locally.

398
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,160
Oh, I know why.

399
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,000
Because we're not in the right directory.

400
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,720
All right.

401
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,720
Now let's try running Pulumi up.

402
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,920
Actually, we're gonna do a PIPM shell real quick.

403
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,200
I am running PIPM.

404
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Please don't yell at me if you have issues with PIPM.

405
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,800
We can talk about it later.

406
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,080
All right, now we're getting a preview.

407
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,640
And why is it all the way stuck up there?

408
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,480
Hello.

409
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,760
Hello.

410
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,600
I don't know why it's lovingly doing that.

411
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,360
We're gonna make it its own window.

412
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,400
Maybe, here we go.

413
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,480
All right, so here we go.

414
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,000
Now we're getting what we need to see here.

415
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Let's make this a little bit bigger.

416
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,160
Hello.

417
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,920
Here we go.

418
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,520
Okay, so what this is doing is it's running a live update.

419
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,200
It gives me a preview first.

420
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,600
This is important whenever you're doing

421
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,400
any kind of infrastructure's code.

422
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,360
You need to be able to see what it's about to do

423
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,960
to your environment before it actually runs.

424
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,840
So in this case, we are seeing all of these various things

425
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,080
in a very, very, very poor format.

426
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,240
But we'll see the reaction of our data set,

427
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,440
our bucket, our table, the bucket object,

428
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,360
the function, the function number, and the jobs.

429
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,880
So we can actually look at details,

430
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,000
but I'm just gonna hit yes,

431
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,600
and we're gonna see that it's gonna actually deploy.

432
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,640
Now this does take a little bit,

433
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,320
and then I don't know why this isn't scrolling.

434
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,160
Here we go.

435
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,160
You know, we did have the Jet Brands people here.

436
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,680
Maybe I need to have a discussion with them

437
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,920
about what this is doing when it's in

438
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,480
a weird terminal function like this.

439
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,280
Because normally it shows me a nice little table

440
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,720
and it shows that everything actually deployed.

441
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,160
Oh, we're gonna wait with it, because you know, live demo.

442
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,680
I don't do it, I don't do it.

443
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,840
This function actually does take a little bit of time

444
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,840
to deploy here, but actually, I wonder if we can see it.

445
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,840
I, oh, we're gonna go see if we can see

446
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,640
what it's doing in this health console.

447
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,280
There it is, so you can actually see my function

448
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,880
is getting made up there at the top.

449
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,520
We'll make that a little bit bigger.

450
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,640
All right, my computer doesn't like me today.

451
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,320
But it's running.

452
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,360
We have our code, where did my terminal go?

453
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,280
There it is, still creating.

454
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,560
While this is creating, do anybody have any questions for me?

455
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,480
Terry?

456
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,840
Is this like the Terraform?

457
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,840
Is this like the Terraform process?

458
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,080
Sort of, it's kind of like the Terraform process.

459
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,680
The big difference between Pulumi and Terraform

460
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,640
is that we use development languages, programming languages.

461
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,160
So if you're familiar with Terraform,

462
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,600
we just did a Pulumi preview,

463
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,200
it's kind of like a Terraform plan,

464
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,960
where it just kind of checks and sees what's out there.

465
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,280
And then we're running Pulumi up,

466
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,400
which is whatever Terraform's like applied.

467
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,280
I guess it's Terraform applied, yes?

468
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,600
I think that's what it's called.

469
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,120
Anyway, so yeah.

470
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,960
Well, any other questions while we're waiting for this thing

471
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,640
to decide to finish right now?

472
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,840
Yeah, Ryan?

473
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,280
If you run this more than once,

474
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,480
are you gonna create multiple resources

475
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,040
or does it update the resources?

476
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,880
Great question.

477
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,720
The question was, if we run this more than once,

478
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,560
does it recreate all of the resources,

479
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,360
multiple resources, or just update

480
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,880
the ones that are in place, right?

481
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,200
It's gonna update the ones that are in place.

482
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,760
That's actually the next part of the demo.

483
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,680
No, so generally, infrastructure is code.

484
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,640
This is one of the reasons why you use it,

485
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,640
is that it doesn't actually try to reinstall everything.

486
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,720
It does actually make sure

487
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,000
that you don't reapply everything,

488
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,120
so you're not rebuilding everything.

489
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,440
The reason that's really important

490
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,680
is that it takes less time,

491
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,040
therefore you're spending less money,

492
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,880
which is a good thing,

493
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,200
and you also don't really overdo it.

494
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,360
All right, how many people think it's the 25th?

495
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,160
How many people think it's the 27th?

496
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,920
The fourth, take a look at that.

497
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,920
That right there, friends, is the 25th of March.

498
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,240
Since 1950, we have had, what is that,

499
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,120
over 50 hail events on March 25th.

500
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,440
Now, that also includes,

501
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,400
because you have to remember,

502
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,200
this is reports of hail,

503
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,360
so that includes multiple reports on Sundays.

504
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,600
So, next year, March 25th comes around,

505
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,400
maybe consider taking your car to the garage.

506
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,120
We're covering it with pool noodles

507
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,160
or whatever else we're doing today.

508
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,920
So, go do some science.

509
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,600
The very first link that you see up there

510
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,040
will have my GitHub repo,

511
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,640
so if you want to go do this yourself, you certainly can.

512
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,360
Thank you all so much for listening.

513
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,560
Thank you for putting up with my technical difficulties,

514
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,960
and I'd love to take any questions y'all have.

515
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,840
Thank you very much.

516
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,480
Have a good time.

517
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,620
Good luck, everyone.

518
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,240
Okay.

519
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,080
Good job.

520
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,920
Bye.

521
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
Have a good one.

522
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,880
Bye.

523
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,720
Have a good one.

524
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
Ooohhh!

525
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Have a good one.

526
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,320
Have a good one.

527
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,720
Have a good one.

528
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,440
Have a good one.

529
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,060
Bye.

530
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,880
Bye.

531
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,480
Bye.

532
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,800
