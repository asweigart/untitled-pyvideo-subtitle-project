00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
Thank you everyone for your patience as I become the conference gremlin and I am so

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,160
sorry.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:17,840
So hello, Pi Texas, as he said, my name is Amy Ramlo-Nagret and I'm here to talk about

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,800
cloud cost analysis, which is a series of words I can say without making it sound like

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,980
a joke.

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,400
So how do I make this go down?

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,000
There we go.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,960
So why are we talking about this?

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:38,000
Why is it important and what is it and basically what is the next 20 minutes or however fast

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,440
I can talk be about?

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,600
It's cloud cost analysis on the shortest version of it is you get a bill from your provider.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,600
I'm assuming we all know what cloud is.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,880
We all know what cloud is or are we still on prem?

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,760
How many people are still on prem?

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,760
Still works.

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,040
So this math will still work.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:05,320
It just your bill is coming from a completely different place, maybe internally.

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,800
So it's taking about what that bill comes out to and being able to translate that into

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,440
architecture decisions.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,320
That is a short version.

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,200
There was going to be a I said out loud earlier the words, I'm going to do a live demo and

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,140
then everything earlier happened and that's not going to happen anymore.

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,700
So we're just going to burn past that part.

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,820
You'll see the slide where I was supposed to do the demo.

25
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,980
It's funny to me now.

26
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,780
So what is cloud cost analysis?

27
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,740
Oh, it's right here also.

28
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,620
You've also probably heard it called FinOps or cloud economics.

29
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,740
It's a bunch of words to make technology and finance sound like they are supposed to go

30
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:59,100
together even though you think about it and you feel kind of bad inside.

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:07,000
What it all of that kind is on is a practice of how your architecture is derived from business

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,140
decisions and how that turns into spend.

33
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,780
As engineers, we'd all like to do that efficiently.

34
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,600
We like to build things efficiently.

35
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,540
We'd like things to work when we want when they're supposed to.

36
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:27,540
We'd like them to not go down and we'd like to not pay for horrible mistakes or even not

37
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,540
so horrible mistakes.

38
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,780
Maybe it's not even our mistake that we're paying for.

39
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,660
All of the money we spend or don't is a result of the things that we build and where we build

40
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,660
it.

41
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,860
But that's boring and we're here to look at code, but I crashed a bunch of stuff so we're

42
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,060
not going to.

43
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,940
Besides, programming starts at design.

44
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:02,340
We all know what happens when we go into a situation, go, I have a vague idea of what

45
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,340
we want.

46
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,060
It feels super simple to do.

47
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,340
I'm just going to go hands to keyboard and do it.

48
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,380
Now if my slides are working, imagine like a good old garbage fire here because that's

49
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,680
basically what happens.

50
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:24,840
We're going to end up with trying to go, oh, all I have to do is build this one function,

51
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,040
stand up this one machine and it'll be fine.

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,600
Next thing you know, you have three machines.

53
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,000
They all have like half written code on it and it's all garbage.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,280
It's all a mess.

55
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,100
This graph right here is basically what I've been describing.

56
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,700
Then we're trying to build out a simple ETL.

57
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,660
We're going to take some data in, we're going to do some stuff to it and we're going to

58
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,140
shove it into some kind of data storage.

59
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:00,660
That's perfect, it's simple, it's an endpoint, it's a compute, it's a database.

60
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,660
And then we stand it up to the best of our ability.

61
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,660
Then we get the bill.

62
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,180
What do you mean I'm paying $15 for a database?

63
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,180
That doesn't seem right.

64
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,060
I wrote four things to it.

65
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,900
What am I going to do about that?

66
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:23,300
Oh, well, if you have to work in any kind of team where your budget is handed down from

67
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,340
leadership, they're going to ask you those questions and you're going to say, that's

68
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,580
how much a database costs and that's not that much.

69
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,580
We'll try to make it less.

70
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,820
You didn't really use it that much according to your architecture metrics.

71
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,020
Okay, fine.

72
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,780
You try to narrow it down.

73
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,980
And then you bring it down more and then they look at those and then you're back into the

74
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,720
design, you're back into the architecture, the bill comes again.

75
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,700
That is a real life billing cycle.

76
00:04:49,700 --> 00:05:00,340
It isn't just when your bill comes, it's what happens between every invoice.

77
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:10,740
I do a lot of talks specifically about metrics and observability and other things.

78
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:17,100
The key is that metrics is numbers, observability is insight.

79
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,460
And cost comes out as both.

80
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,620
You can find out what you're doing from how much you're spending and you can also measure

81
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,660
what you're spending against what you're doing.

82
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,860
If you're going to use it as a metric, the kind of data you're going to pull in from

83
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,460
your usage reports are things like resource IDs.

84
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,500
The actual ID that's stamped on every VM that gets sent to you, you can actually break that

85
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,980
down against how much you're actually using versus the retail rate.

86
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,480
Also usage incurred, I said all of these words already in one sentence, but usage incurred

87
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,480
is how long something is running.

88
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,660
Retail rate is how much they're actually charging you before you get things like credits and

89
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,060
discounts and whatever.

90
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,300
And the amount you're charged, which is post off the discounts or whatever.

91
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,820
So let's, there are some platforms that run flat rate, DigitalOcean runs flat rate.

92
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:12,860
Full disclosure, I am a DigitalOcean employee, I do work in their developer advocacy.

93
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:19,060
So if you do flat rate, you want to be sure to measure your usage against what that dollar

94
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,380
is because the dollar is going to be the same every month if you're using it less on a

95
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:30,100
certain period and more on another, that's the kind of data you want to dig into.

96
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:37,120
Now if you're, I also used to work a bunch on IEWS stuff where they have tiered pricing.

97
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,780
If you're using it a lot, that number goes up real fast and you want to be able to measure

98
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,680
that stuff out.

99
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,620
And that's when we come into cost as an insight.

100
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,460
That's how much you actually spend over any given period of time.

101
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,940
Users that have the most growth, that's a thing that you can easily sort out out of

102
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,260
any MySQL table, which was part of my demonstration and now it's gone.

103
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,260
And scaling, as I mentioned, that breaks tiers, especially if you're dealing with a bunch

104
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,580
of requests, that may not even suggest more users.

105
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:19,620
It just could be, it can be a DDoS attack, it can just be the same, if you work in education,

106
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,620
you'll get a lot more traffic in certain months than you will in others when everyone's

107
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,220
on vacation.

108
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:35,620
And then you'll see your pricing break through that tiering and go into the highest amount.

109
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,100
This is where I was going to demonstrate how to build an application and I can't work,

110
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:47,460
but the general thing here is your receipts go in, you're going to do that ETL transformation

111
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,820
that I described earlier.

112
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,420
What you're going to do is make sure to key up all of the columns.

113
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,020
And by the way, all cloud providers change their column keys.

114
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,140
They say they don't, but they do.

115
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,940
And they won't warn you when they do it.

116
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:09,120
So you want to make sure that that kind of thing is always validated before you put it

117
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,460
into your data store, unless you're using something like Athena or Hadoop.

118
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,500
This is where my demo would come.

119
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:27,020
In any case, what the demo was going to do was we were going to pull in a bunch and we

120
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,140
were going to pull in my live receipts, especially considering it is the first of the month and

121
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,140
I just got a bunch.

122
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,620
And we were going to do some transformation, we're going to do some SQL queries, I'm going

123
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,620
to pump that into a database.

124
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,780
That's all it really takes.

125
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,820
And a lot of even large organizations don't realize that you can do that automagically.

126
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:53,220
There are organizations out there that still take in their receipts through their email

127
00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:00,420
and forward it through email to their finance department and say, you go copy and paste

128
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,660
this into Excel.

129
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,020
Please don't do that.

130
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,860
Never copy and paste into Excel.

131
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,500
It will hurt your feelings.

132
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,900
Oh, if you learn anything, don't do that.

133
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:18,740
You can, every, all of the large providers also provide built-in tooling specifically

134
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:24,940
for this purpose because the larger providers have 20 million services, a quarter of them

135
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,220
do the same thing, they won't tell you which ones.

136
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:34,060
And then they will send you a big blob of data and an invoice saying, you can pay this

137
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,980
in 30, 90 days, depending on what your contract says.

138
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,500
So before, you used to have to do that by hand.

139
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,140
Now the tooling is built in.

140
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:52,420
You should still also, this is just a personal, I don't trust anybody else's math problem.

141
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,620
Download your own data, do your own work, reconcile it with what the cloud says.

142
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:02,500
And then if it's wrong, you can get stuff back because they never get things wrong.

143
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,060
That's not in their favor.

144
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:14,340
Okay, so for GCP, this is especially important if you're running Kubernetes because Kubernetes

145
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,340
is expensive.

146
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,580
Kubernetes is not only expensive, it has a bunch of hidden costs, especially as far as

147
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,900
things like data transfer and all of that stuff that you will not see when you're doing

148
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,500
your first draft of design.

149
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,420
They have a billing account API, a billing budget API, and a cost estimation API when

150
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,700
you're ready to do forecasting.

151
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,940
You want to be able to focus on the billing account API, that's the one where you download

152
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,940
all of your stuff.

153
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:48,180
It has a built-in native trigger to the PubSub that you can pump either into BigQuery or

154
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,180
Looker.

155
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:54,260
And then you can get really nice, super complicated dashboards like that, and you can find out

156
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,820
what your month over month is.

157
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:01,020
You can find out what services are eating all of your spend.

158
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:06,820
And you can find out if you get all of your departments to actually tag their resources.

159
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,860
You can find out which department to blame and charge for it.

160
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:20,540
AWS, I did a lot of work in this, and I'm trying to find a nice way of saying this.

161
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,220
Turn on your curve.

162
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,820
It is your cost and usage report.

163
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,060
It is not on by default for some reason.

164
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,020
And when you turn it on, they will only turn it on from the point you asked them to.

165
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:36,500
So if you're an organization that's had been on their cloud for a while, you have to actually

166
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,700
send a request through your TAM to get it turned on for you.

167
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,580
All of these things are not built in.

168
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,020
You have to do it by hand.

169
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,100
You have to send this directly into S3 and then put Athena on top of that.

170
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,900
And if you don't want to give everybody in your company a Tableau license or an Excel

171
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:59,140
license because those do those prices do add up, you will want to use QuickSight that

172
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,140
is built in and then you can put on top of it.

173
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:08,660
It's not pretty or really very flexible, but it will give you a graph like this so you

174
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:14,420
can find out the basics of the information that you need.

175
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:22,620
And Azure, Azure, because they are Microsoft and Microsoft is an enterprise based organization,

176
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,980
they have a lot of billing stuff ready to go.

177
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,740
You can just go into their dashboard and their dashboard will automatically give you that.

178
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:37,880
You can also, if you have a Power BI instance, it'll pump right into that.

179
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,340
And it's all basically done for you if you can even take the information directly out

180
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:47,580
of Power BI and do your own analytics if you would like.

181
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:53,500
This was a lot of talk for if you check this GitHub right here in the corner where you

182
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,260
can actually see all these slides because I don't know about you, I am better at reading

183
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:02,340
than hearing, that it's 60 lines of code to build that ETL.

184
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,460
It is super easy.

185
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,360
It was not a lot of code.

186
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,620
The concepts themselves are actually very important, especially right now.

187
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:18,100
One reason, Python, the way I was introduced into Python was someone in our company had

188
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,660
used it for analytics.

189
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,900
It's very good for that.

190
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:26,740
Sure, you can do R or something else, I'm sure, on top of that if you are better at

191
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,060
analytics than me.

192
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:34,100
But if you have to run these numbers and do that type of analysis work, Python is great

193
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,260
for it.

194
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,700
And also, cost optimization is about efficiency.

195
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:46,900
All the efficiencies you build into your architecture do turn into, wait, as I said, should turn

196
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,140
into savings on your bill.

197
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:54,220
Sometimes it won't and when it doesn't, that is a thing to investigate and talk to whoever

198
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,660
your account manager is.

199
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,940
And right now, efficiency, especially where your receipts are concerned, are extremely

200
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:09,020
important, especially with the, what are my new favorite words, macroeconomic conditions.

201
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:16,620
So if you are in the sector of technology where you're kind of always looking over

202
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,020
your shoulder, now is a good time to dig into your bill and see how you can make things

203
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,340
cheaper.

204
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,740
See if you can make things more efficiency and make sure those efficiencies actually

205
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,660
do turn up in your bill.

206
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,920
Sometimes we hyper-optimize for performance and because it doesn't show up in your bill,

207
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,580
it becomes an argument we have to have later on in the quarter when someone's doing their

208
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,860
budget review.

209
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,700
You did all of this work, you told us it improved, then why aren't we seeing our costs come down?

210
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:50,140
It's like, well, see, it's like we became more performant, we're processing more requests,

211
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,460
et cetera, et cetera.

212
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,700
That is why the bill did not change.

213
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,260
And then you can match it to your retail rate, you can match it to your accounts, you can

214
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,340
match it to any kind of enterprise agreement you have.

215
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:09,300
Being able to understand these is a great way to keep your budget.

216
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:15,300
If you are a small startup or you have a small side project that is starting to take off

217
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,460
and you need to get some kind of VC funding, obviously not from SVP, but I hear there are

218
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:26,540
other people still doing that kind of work, if you're going to do that, this is the first

219
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,700
thing they're going to ask.

220
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,860
They're going to ask about your efficiency, they're going to ask if you already did your

221
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,340
cost off work because that would be the first thing they'll tell you to do before coming

222
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,820
back for money because they want to make sure that you are using the money that they give

223
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,860
you for the right things.

224
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:48,380
So right now, my entire thing is understand what you're spending, making sure that your

225
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,980
code is doing the thing that it's supposed to do, making sure your architecture is doing

226
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,340
the thing it's supposed to do for how much you should be doing it for.

227
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:01,540
That way, we can all kind of keep a little more to ourselves and, like I said, survive

228
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,100
all of these macroeconomic conditions.

229
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:13,140
So I'm sure there are a lot of questions because I skipped over a lot that I couldn't get to,

230
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:20,420
but if you just follow this repo, I'm not doing this for stars or anything, this is

231
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,220
also a thing that I'm going to expand to also cover those other clouds.

232
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,060
It also has the demo code that I was going to present.

233
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:34,140
I should warn you that, as I've mentioned before, I'm actually a PHP developer.

234
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:39,300
I do Python for work, but PHP is the thing I'm good at.

235
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,180
So if you see ways of making my code better, please tell me.

236
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,380
I'm perfectly fine taking criticism.

237
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:57,860
And if you also have any other questions specifically about doing cost analysis, it's like how can

238
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,980
we make this more efficient, I'm also out there, I'm willing to answer questions wherever

239
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,980
on all of these things.

240
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,980
I'm also on the Discord and I'll talk to you about anything.

241
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,540
So I talked as fast as possible, yay!
