1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Sweet, okay. Let me know when it starts.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You may start.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Awesome. This is my 1970 Volkswagen Beetle. Doesn't this look really cool?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yeah, I love it. Anybody ever drive an old Volkswagen?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Raise your hand. I know there's a certain generation that everybody and their friend had one.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I've had this for almost two years. Shortly after getting it, though, sadly I blew up the engine.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It was a very sad day. I had to pull into a gas station called AAA, and this is what happened. They took it away.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So I decided, let me just swap the whole engine because people can do that.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So on the left side you see the original 1500cc engine, and on the right a brand new 1600cc dual-port engine.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I did this in my garage for these old Volkswagen Beetles. The engine's in the back.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You jack it up, you drop the engine out, you dolly it around.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I did this with my mom at home. It was a lot of fun. It was a bonding experience.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I even painted the heat things on the side and the exhaust system. It's red, it's black, it didn't stay that way very long.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But it was shiny for a while. I also did a full interior restoration of this Beetle.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Even though the outside, as you saw, looked like it was in immaculate condition, the inside was nasty.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It was owned by some 55-year-old guy named Joseph Smith from outside Greensboro, North Carolina.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He liked to smoke inside. Eww. So I did everything on the inside.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I tore these old panels off, put hushmat inside, put the new panels on. Doesn't it look nice?

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes, it looks very nice. I gutted the entirety of the insides of this thing down to the bare metal.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You can see here the floor pans. On the top you see a nice, fuzzy, soft headliner pad.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Then this is me putting the headliner in. It's a nice sand-colored tweed.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I had to pop out all the windows and windshields for this thing.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is a very iconic picture of me doing this very laborious work.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I spent Fourth of July all week last year doing this project.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Inside here's what that headliner looks like. Isn't that a nice color?

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
As well as the sun visors, that nice tan.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This is what the full headliner looks like with the new brown carpet to match everything, as well as the new steering wheel.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, it is so nice, isn't it?

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And here's the back seats. I got the insert with the cream color and the tan that all matches.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You can see the side panels there, as well as that back shelf.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You can see six by nine speakers if you missed it back here.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Under the kick panels you can see six inch speakers as well, the woofers.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Underneath this back shelf is an eight inch subwoofer.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
My beetle goes boom, boom. It sounds amazing.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I spent way too much money on it. The amplifiers in the trunk.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I ran all the lines myself with help of my friend Steven Fetzer.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Here's what the old interior looks like with the seats. They were kind of saggy, nasty, icky.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It smelled kind of weird.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This on the right is what it looks like now, and yes, that is a lucky cat on the gear shifter.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Four on the floor, baby. Woo!

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is a picture of it. After I finally got it all running and working, I'm in downtown Raleigh here.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Doesn't it look nice? Yes.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Even my puppy dog, Suki, thinks it looks nice.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
See how happy she is? Yeah! Oh my gosh, she's so happy.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, oh, look at that grin.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah, pictures worth a thousand words.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So we did so well with this beetle. You know what I did? I went and bought another air-cooled Volkswagen.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
First I had the Type 1, now I have the Type 2.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This is the 1979 Volkswagen bus or transporter, minibus, station wagon, whatever you want to call it.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This is the last year they made it of the bay window style.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You can tell it's bay window because the windshield is one piece and the windows along the side are long.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I picked this up from a guy in Eastern Carolina.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This bus had been sitting for a decade or two, decades or more.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't know how long, but we scooped it up for a great deal for a cash offer.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We had AAA haul at home because I was within the 100-mile limit.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Here it is, true story, here it is on my mother-in-law's driveway.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I did a little bit of things, you can see it's kind of ick.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We got the little droopy eyes.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We affectionately call this thing the Big Turd.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And when we wrap it up, we call it the Big Burrito.

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes, the wheels were really nasty.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Here you can see, I love that it was white wall, but unfortunately all the rims were toast,

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
so I had to do the wheels and the tires and everything.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I did that myself.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You can see my giant jack.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I tried saving the wheel rims.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Two of them were totally rusted out.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Two of them I kind of de-rusted a bit and sold them to people on eBay.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I actually bought them.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's pretty cool.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The door hinge was frozen shut.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That sucked, so I had to go figure that out.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But now that's working.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh, also, one thing that happens in the little Volkswagens, the floor is always rusted out.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Do you see the floor in there?

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's like it was fresh.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I couldn't believe it.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's why I bought this thing.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It was incredible.

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Suki wasn't happy with the inside, though it smells like a Big Turd inside.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So that one's still a work in progress.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Where do we go next?

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh, am I out of time?

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Then I got a Carmen Ghia.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yay.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Isn't this beautiful?

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Look at that.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I got it from Tennessee.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Suki's not sure about it.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I had to replace the clutch thingy, but man, glam shots.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What's the moral?

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh, yeah, the license plate is error.

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What's the moral of the story?

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Do things away from your screen.

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Software isn't everything.

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Have some hobbies.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Go outside.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Thank you.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I would need them.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I mean, I have to type a lot on mine.

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Ah.

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Well.

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That is why we have the stand.

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay.

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah, my video's up.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I mean, it's up on my screen.

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh, this is my screen.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This is not what I'm seeing here.

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That's what Sato said.

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Hey, there we go.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Oh, here?

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah.

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, but now I don't see it myself.

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Right down there.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You should see what they see.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh.

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Are you good?

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Would be.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Okay.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah, I mean, that works, too.

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
All right.

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Get your time in the mic, and then we'll start the timer now.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
First of all, thank you to all the organizers for this wonderful conference.

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yesterday, we saw an interesting talk by Elle about recursive function calls.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So I thought it would be nice to talk about recursive data structures in Python and how

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
you can do that.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So now I have to look here and type here.

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So you create, for example, put this over here, like an empty list, and now you can

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
append the list to itself.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And when the wrapper actually displays it in a meaningful way, it doesn't go into a

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
recursive loop.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And the interesting thing about this, if you look at the first element, it just looks like

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
the list itself.

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And you can do that, like, as many times as you want.

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You can actually pickle a recursive list, and you can also deep copy a recursive list.

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's made to work like that.

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Next, we can look at a dictionary.

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Again, we start with an empty dictionary.

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Now we just say one entry, none, equals the dict itself.

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And now we have a dictionary with one key, and the value is the dictionary itself.

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And again, d of none is that dictionary.

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And you can repeat that many times.

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Next, I was looking at tuples.

150
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The problem with tuples is that tuples are immutable.

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You can't just append something or change an element in a tuple, which is true from

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the Python layer, but it's not true in the C layer, in the implementation of Python.

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm using CPython, by the way, as probably most people here do.

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So I wrote this little...

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What is going on here?

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh, no, I'm on the...

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh, I mistyped.

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Control backslash.

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That didn't help.

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And we just kill the whole thing, maybe.

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Bring up...

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah, I brought up...

163
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh, here's a big error message now.

164
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't know where my mouse is.

165
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah, but I need it here, too.

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, here it is again.

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Drag this over again.

168
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Make it bigger again.

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay.

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So here's my C function.

171
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's called recur tuple.

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It creates a recursive tuple.

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And what it does, it creates a tuple object with one element.

174
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And then it sets the zero, the first element of the tuple, to itself and then returns it.

175
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So let's compile this.

176
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Let's see what we get from...

177
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah.

178
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And this is my recursive tuple object, which you can only create by tricks.

179
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But Python is smart enough...

180
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Python is smart enough to display it correctly.

181
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's not smart enough to deep copy it or pickle it correctly.

182
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It goes into a stack overflow.

183
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And what is even worse, you can calculate hashes of tuples normally.

184
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But if you do it with this tuple, something very terrible happens.

185
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Okay.

186
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's it.

187
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Thank you, Elan.

188
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Be careful with recursive data structures.

189
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
No one needs to open a rip in space-time, okay?

190
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Come on up, Mara.

191
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The mic is yours.

192
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Start your time as soon as you start talking.

193
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
All right.

194
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So hello, everyone.

195
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
My name is Mara.

196
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And I recently graduated from college.

197
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Last May, I went to UT Austin and got a degree in computer science.

198
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And since then, I've been working for around nine months in industry.

199
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So I wanted to talk a little bit about some of the differences I noticed in industry versus academia.

200
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So I noticed differences in lots of different ways.

201
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But I'm going to talk about the three main ways that I noticed right now.

202
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So the first being is the time spent coding.

203
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So as a student, we're kind of expected to just sit down and like pump out our code.

204
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And we don't really usually have to worry about documentation or anything like that.

205
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
We're just trying to get our code out the door.

206
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Whereas in industry, we have to juggle meetings.

207
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
We have to juggle documentation.

208
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
We have to juggle collaborating with teammates.

209
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And you're not just always sitting down and writing code, although you are still writing code part of the time, obviously.

210
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And then next, the next difference is coding style.

211
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So in academia, like I said, a lot of the mentality is really just focusing on getting your code just out the door so that it can get graded.

212
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And so you can turn your project in on time.

213
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Whereas in industry, good coding style is extremely important because you have to upkeep your code base, make sure it's readable, maintainable,

214
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
because your code lives a lot long after you write it, whenever you're writing it in industry.

215
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And then lastly is collaboration.

216
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So in academia, especially in the classes that I took, collaboration was sort of frowned upon.

217
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You were supposed to work as more or less like a lone wolf, just writing your own code, getting your own projects done.

218
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I mean, you had the group project here and there, but even then, like each of you had your own portion of it that you were working on.

219
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You weren't really collaborating too much.

220
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Whereas in industry, obviously, you need to be constantly collaborating with your stakeholders, your teammates, everyone, discuss the design,

221
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
come up with a design ahead of time and make decisions with others in mind.

222
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So that's a really big difference.

223
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So, yeah, I've enjoyed my time in my limited time in industry so far.

224
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I've had to sort of unlearn a lot of habits that I picked up in college, but I am glad that I'm picking up these new skills.

225
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And I think I'm becoming a more well-rounded developer because of it.

226
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So, yeah, that's my talk.

227
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Thank you.

228
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And she didn't, like, badmouth her senior developer or anything.

229
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh, wait, that was me.

230
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm actually the next lightning talk, so I'll start the timer whenever I want since I control it.

231
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I actually asked to go after Mara because the topic actually bridges nicely off of hers.

232
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Before Mara joined my team, Mara was a college intern on my team, and I was her mentor.

233
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So I talked to her a lot about books and things like that.

234
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I actually like to do for some of the college interns that I mentor a gift of a book or a couple of books that I think are interesting and impactful,

235
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
something that they can take along with themselves.

236
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm going to pass on three. I'll post the links to these books in the Discord after this talk is over.

237
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But these are three books that were really influential to me, and I think they're good for any professional developer.

238
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The first one is this one, Being Geek by Michael Lopp. Does anybody here know who Michael Lopp is?

239
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Has anybody ever heard of Ranz?

240
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
He's worked all over Silicon Valley, worked for Netscape, worked for Slack.

241
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Right now he's at Apple, fantastic guy, has a great podcast, talks a lot about leadership and management.

242
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
This book is a career management handbook for software developers.

243
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It covers everything from trying to find a job, going through the interview, starting on a new team,

244
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
learning communication styles, how to communicate to managers and to peers,

245
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
all the way up through becoming a manager and up through when to start finding a new gig,

246
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
how to tell when you're unhappy and ready to move on.

247
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
This book is fantastic. The chapters are self-contained. You can read them whenever the situation arises.

248
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's a fantastic book and well worth your time. It's also funny, and I like funny.

249
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Not that I'm very funny.

250
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Second book is this one, A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout.

251
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
There is a link here to his talk at Google that he did.

252
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's about an hour-long distillation of the biggest points from the book.

253
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
John Ousterhout is the creator of the Tickle, TickleTK language.

254
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
He is a computer science professor at Stanford.

255
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
He started a software design course because as he said,

256
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
we spend a lot of time teaching young people how to write code.

257
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
We don't spend a lot of time teaching them how to design code.

258
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And good design saves you a lot of code in the long run.

259
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
This book, my favorite line that I've ever heard, is writing working code is the easy part.

260
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Anyone can write code that works.

261
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Writing code that's scalable, that's maintainable, that's evolvable, that's the challenge.

262
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
This book is definitely worth your time. It's a little heady, but it's really interesting stuff.

263
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's language agnostic, and I think it's evergreen.

264
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Last one is Think Like a Programmer, volume one in the series.

265
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I love this book because this book is all about problem decomposition.

266
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Taking a problem and breaking it down into smaller parts,

267
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
and sharing with you techniques to help you identify those parts,

268
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
break down those parts, and useful patterns to solve those.

269
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
This book is fantastic. It's a pretty easy read, and it's a lot of fun.

270
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So, those are my three books that I recommend.

271
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I know the first two I gave copies to Mara when she was my intern.

272
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
This third one was a new one to me. I got it off of a humble bundle.

273
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But since we all have those discount codes for No Starch Press, hey, maybe give this one a try.

274
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Thank you.

275
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And Adam, come on down.

276
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
We're down to the last two.

277
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yep, go for it.

278
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And I will start the timer once your screen comes up. Would you like the hand mic?

279
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Sure. All yours.

280
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Thank you.

281
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
All right, we're mirroring and everything. Awesome.

282
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Okay. So, I wanted to talk a little bit about Python and real-world robots,

283
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
because as I was out talking to people over the last couple days,

284
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I realized that I actually am in what is a fairly niche community,

285
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
as I've discovered in the Python, broader Python community, which is robotics.

286
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So, maybe, I mean, I think everyone, or maybe not everyone,

287
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
but a lot of people really like robots and maybe are interested in them.

288
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And of course, there seems to be some overlap with programming.

289
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Maybe you've used the Lego Mindstorms as a kid,

290
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
or maybe even when you picked up one of these,

291
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
kind of like Arduino or some other microcontroller

292
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and tried to figure out how to program one of these guys.

293
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And if you've done this, you soon learn a few things.

294
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
One, these robots are pretty limited.

295
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Two, for the most part, it's tricky to program them in Python.

296
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
But I want to write them in Python. I love Python, so let's do some Python.

297
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
This is the robot that I work on. This robot's called Moxie.

298
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It is significantly more complicated than the one on the previous slide.

299
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Moxie is a hospital delivery robot.

300
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It delivers supplies to nurses, things like,

301
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
the one you see here is an IV pump that a nurse is pulling out.

302
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So it goes across the hospital, it rides elevators, it goes through doors,

303
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
it has cameras, it has lidars, it has an arm, it has a face.

304
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's really cool. I love working on it.

305
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But how do we go from the little robots on the previous slide to this robot?

306
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
How do you actually program a real-world robot?

307
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Well, it still actually boils down to a few simple steps.

308
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You have to receive data from your sensors.

309
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Okay, darn it. You do that with C++ or C or firmware because it's a lot of data.

310
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Okay, you need to control your actuators.

311
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Well, maybe I can do that with Python. Eh, probably not.

312
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Probably better to do that with C++. It's real-time.

313
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The motions have to be smooth.

314
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Okay, well then, maybe at least I can connect them together with decision-making.

315
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yes, that you can do with Python.

316
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So you might have some sensors, you might have some actuators,

317
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and you'll connect them with Python in the middle.

318
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And so how do we actually do this?

319
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Now we have to get all these pieces to talk to each other in different languages.

320
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Enter robot operating system or ROS.

321
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The first thing you need to know about ROS is that it is not an operating system.

322
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It is instead a multi-language framework for distributed systems.

323
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
What does that mean?

324
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It implements all of the following.

325
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It is a publisher-subscriber mechanism.

326
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It is a service-client architecture.

327
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It is a global key-value parameter store.

328
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's a message-serialization system.

329
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's a build system.

330
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And a bunch of other things.

331
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And, well, it's kind of exhausting,

332
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
but what it boils down to is it's a de facto standard

333
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
for robotic components to talk to each other,

334
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
including your decision-making system.

335
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
How many people here have heard of ROS? I see a couple people nodding.

336
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Okay, maybe like 10, 15 people. That's cool.

337
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And it works in C++ or Python.

338
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So there are some robots that don't use ROS.

339
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Ones that have very high performance needs,

340
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
or ones that are doing something that's very repeatable

341
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
and don't need to be particularly smart.

342
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But I put an asterisk there because a lot of those robots can work with ROS.

343
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
People just choose not to.

344
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But there are lots of robots that do use ROS,

345
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
including the cruise self-driving cars,

346
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
that you might have seen driving around Austin.

347
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Those use ROS.

348
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You can, again, use Robot Arms as a company in San Antonio

349
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
that's using them to sort mail and other things.

350
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And so many other robots,

351
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I could not possibly put them all on one slide.

352
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So it wouldn't be, I think, a Python talk without a little bit of Python.

353
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So here's some Python.

354
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's actually pretty straightforward to use at least the PubSub part of it.

355
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So you're going to import ROS.

356
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You're going to import your message primitives.

357
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
In this case, we're implementing a kind of a robot that would do a stop-start

358
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
based on what it sees in its camera.

359
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So you'll subscribe to your image,

360
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and after you've initialized your node,

361
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
and then spin is basically just asleep,

362
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and it will wait for images to come in,

363
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and it will process callbacks when you receive messages

364
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
on that kind of endpoint there,

365
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
the camera RGB image raw endpoint.

366
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And then we need to implement what the callback looks like.

367
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So you have your callback,

368
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
and then maybe you say,

369
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm going to publish out something to our motor driver

370
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
so I know whether my robot should move fast or slow

371
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
based on what I saw in the image.

372
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And, of course, not shown here is all the computer vision you have to do.

373
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Do the hard part here.

374
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
But the rest of it, ROS makes it pretty easy

375
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
to actually connect the different pieces of your robot together.

376
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So this is a more complex slide.

377
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
This is actually from the debug tools that come built into ROS.

378
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
So I'm not going to go through all this,

379
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
but you can see how you can build out this system of nodes

380
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
and topics all talking to each other

381
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
in order to build out a much more complex robot system.

382
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So as I mentioned, we're a niche community,

383
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
but we're a strong community.

384
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
We have our own Python and C++ Foundation

385
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
where we build open source code, et cetera, et cetera.

386
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Please go to ROS.org to learn more.

387
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You can always ask me questions at levato.me

388
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
or just come find me after.

389
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Thank you very much.

390
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Y'all heard that.

391
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The robotic uprising needs you.

392
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
All right.

393
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I can think of no better way to bookend this entire weekend

394
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
than by having Brandon, who started us,

395
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
be the one that finishes us.

396
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
If my graphics card again condescends to speak to the...

397
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Oh, look at that.

398
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I love the way it works.

399
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Start the timer so that I know...

400
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
All right.

401
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Are we ready?

402
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Set, go!

403
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I love the way it works.

404
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Start the timer so that I know...

405
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
All right, are we ready?

406
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Set, go!

407
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Many of the things that make me most productive are shortcuts.

408
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
The things that have advanced my, like,

409
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
just ability to get things done quickly during the day

410
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and not be filled with rage at how slowly I'm typing or something.

411
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Unfortunately, shortcuts are some of the least discoverable

412
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
of all things.

413
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
They used to, like, put them in menus where you could see them,

414
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
but they're becoming less and less popular and less easy to find.

415
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
For instance, in Chrome, my day is so much faster

416
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
because I know that Control 1, Control 2, 3

417
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
move me directly to tab number 1, 2, and 3 in the current window.

418
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So if I, for example, I always keep my email, Gmail, and tab number 2,

419
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
so however many tabs deep I've gone doing some research for an email,

420
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I can jump right back to the email I'm typing with Control 2.

421
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Another very common operation that I was not taught everything about

422
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
at first is cutting and pasting text.

423
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Very often, one of the first things we learn about using the computer

424
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
is that while clicking moves the cursor somewhere,

425
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
dragging lets us select a region of text.

426
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
If we, at the end, kind of miss,

427
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
here I haven't gotten the whole word measure.

428
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
If I've only grabbed the initial M,

429
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
we don't have to start over and go back to the top.

430
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
By holding down Shift and dragging,

431
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
we can modify the very end of the selection to fix it up

432
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
without having to go back and find the beginning again.

433
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
What I was not told initially was that there's a much easier way

434
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
to grab a selection if I want whole words.

435
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
If you start with a double click, kind of click, click, hold,

436
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
then you're now selecting entire words.

437
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
On any operating system I've tried, any browser,

438
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
and now I don't have to be careful not to end in the middle of a word.

439
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I don't have to aim as carefully, and I'm able to move more quickly.

440
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I can grab whole words.

441
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Finally, triple click is what lets me grab entire lines.

442
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
This is great for grabbing,

443
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
because normally when I'm cutting and pasting source code,

444
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I want whole lines, and this lets me effortlessly,

445
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
without having to carefully start at the beginning of one line

446
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
or the end of another, I can just have my mouse wherever I want

447
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and grab whole lines of code from an email from a web page.

448
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So, GitHub.

449
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I've been seeing this error all over the place on my laptop this week,

450
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
as GitHub, for the first time ever, had to rotate their SSH keys,

451
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
and my computers over the years learned that every one of the addresses,

452
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
the IP addresses on their rotor, their name server rotor for ssh.github.com,

453
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
all of those IP addresses, it's gradually learned that that SSH key

454
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
goes with all of those IP addresses.

455
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So, during the week, each time I use it again,

456
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I seem to get a different IP address and get this error all over again.

457
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I fixed it the first time or two, and then I just got tired,

458
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and I just started ignoring the error.

459
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But this morning I decided, when it happened again, it needed to be fixed.

460
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
All right, it tells me that the error is a key in known hosts, line 46.

461
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Well, okay, I could go up, and maybe if I'm careful,

462
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
character by character, try to get exactly that number,

463
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and then I'd have to remember the name of command

464
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
or write one that would remove the correct line.

465
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Wow, that's going to take too long.

466
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
What if I double-click?

467
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
All right, that's the file name, a colon in the line number.

468
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I don't have any commands that will accept that easily as input,

469
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
and I'd have to remember, type the command.

470
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And then it hit me.

471
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Triple-click.

472
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
If I triple-click, then I get a line,

473
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
which if pasted into the shell, is a perfectly valid shell command.

474
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It has no syntax errors, no asterisks or funny characters

475
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
that would confuse the shell.

476
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It looks perfectly syntactically in the shell

477
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
like a command named capital O offending, a space,

478
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and the shell will just think the other words are the arguments to the command.

479
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
There's only one problem.

480
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
There isn't a Unix command called capital O offending until today.

481
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:36,000
If you'll go to github.com and look under Brandon Rhodes' home dir,

482
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
where I have my home directory, into the bin folder that I keep on my path,

483
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
you will find there is now an offending command written for this occasion in Python

484
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
that verifies that the arguments on the command line indeed form this error message.

485
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It goes into known hosts, makes a backup of the file, and deletes the offending line.

486
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,000
The piece de résistance was that I got an error trying to push this,

487
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and had my system self-heal using the error message itself as the antidote.

488
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I triple-clicked.

489
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I pasted.

490
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I hit enter, and I was able to get push.

491
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I've loved PyTexas.

492
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Thank you very much.
