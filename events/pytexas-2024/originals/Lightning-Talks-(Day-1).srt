00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,820
Panny Knight. What's up family? How we doing by Texas? My lightning talk I'm

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:16,540
going to talk about BDD. Who here knows what BDD is? What is it? You're

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,940
wrong. It stands for Bulldog Driven Development. This is my bulldog. Her name

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,120
is Suki. She is a French bulldog. Did you know Frenchies are the most popular dog

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,720
breed in America? I mean just look at this thing. She is thick and juicy like

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:38,080
a steak. Oh so cute. My wife and I, this is our first dog. People ask do you have

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,280
children? We say no. We have a bulldog. This is Suki. This is our baby child. In

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,200
Chinese we call her ma hai zi meaning fur baby. She is very much the favorite

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,800
child of the family. Just oh my gosh look at this having so much fun. Suki gets to

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,800
travel the US. We've taken her down to Jacksonville to see the beaches of

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,880
Florida. We've taken her down to Savannah to see the beautiful trees. We've taken

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,520
her to Seattle. These are the spheres in the Amazon district. They go by another

13
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,360
name. This is also some some park out in the Pacific Northwest. She's an adventure

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,560
puppy. We love it. She's even been to Bucky's. Yes Suki has been to Bucky's.

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,240
She's having a good time. When she's not traveling the US she's

16
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,400
pooping around the house and yes poop is a verb. P-O-O-K. I want to turn this

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,760
picture into him like an Andy Warhol print you know. Sometimes you can hear

18
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,600
pictures. Look at her trying to bark. Or sometimes if she's not pooping around

19
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,920
the house she's sitting there silently judging you. She is the master of the

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,040
side eye. Sometimes she's a grumpy pants. I think her spirit human is Wilfer

21
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,640
Brimley trying to tell me about diabetes.

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,360
Sometimes she we think she might be a bullfrog instead of a bulldog. But we

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,600
know that's not true because she doesn't like getting wet. Poor puppy. But at the

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,200
end of the day we love this dog. She is our baby. She is a gift from God. Suki the

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,960
Frenchie has made our lives so much better.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:15,000
Awww. You know we're all driven by something and I know this is a Python

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,680
conference for in a software context. I mean there's behavior driven

28
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,400
development, test driven development, data driven development. I don't know

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,880
whatever the else driven development right. But I think it's important to

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,720
remember that we make software for humans and it's important to remember

31
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:35,800
what drives us right. I'm driven by my family, by my faith, and by my bulldog. So

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,040
never forget what drives you to do what you do. Thank you very much by Texas. This

33
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,080
is Bulldog Driven Development. My name is Pandy Knight. It's been an honor.

34
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,520
Better? Okay. All right. So I'm going to talk about strings. Who uses strings in

35
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:58,280
their Python scripts? Okay everybody that's right. And what I'm going to talk

36
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,400
about are a couple of things that you'll find about using strings in your

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,920
production applications. Strings are everywhere and they have everything in

38
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,320
them. They'll have what you expect. I'll have what you don't expect. They'll have

39
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,000
spaces. They'll have character turns. They'll have new lines and so forth.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,760
Control characters. Sometimes nothing. So there are a number of common less than

41
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,560
best practices for working with strings. I've got three of them on this list. And

42
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,920
why are they common? They're common because this is what's in the tutorials

43
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,240
that you'll find online. Because the tutorials are written back in time

44
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,480
before some of these newer features are there for better practices with strings.

45
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,680
So I'll start with the first one which is how to remove leading and trimming

46
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,880
literals with string, Lstrip, and Rstrip. Actually that's the anti-pattern. And for

47
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,120
those of you who are here last year I actually did a lightning talk and this

48
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,640
was one of the slides out of this so I'm rerunning this this particular hint. But

49
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,320
in this case we're using Lstrip to remove the leading www off of this web

50
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,240
address. Unfortunately Lstrip is a more aggressive than you think because it's

51
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,480
not using a string. That string is actually the list of characters that

52
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:22,080
we're going to remove from the source string. So removing www dot is actually

53
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:29,880
going to give us lsfargo.com. Solution as of Python 3.9 is to use remove

54
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,680
prefix and remove suffix which now are smarter about removing those segments

55
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:47,680
from the source string. The next one I have is to use string dot split to split

56
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,640
a string into two parts. The first example here isn't really a

57
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,920
surprise it's actually doing what we expect. We want to split on the letter B

58
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:03,400
and we get everything before everything after. The variability is that if the B

59
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,800
isn't there we're just going to get a single element list which which has the

60
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,360
entire string in it. In the following two examples where we give it an empty

61
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,360
string or a string containing just a B we get either a single element or a

62
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,080
double element but we don't really we have to have a more code we have to

63
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:30,640
figure out was the B even there and what was in place around it. So for production

64
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,480
use you want something more predictable and that's partition. With string dot

65
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,520
partition you always well in fact there's the advantage you always get a

66
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,880
three-string tuple and the center tuple or the center value is the separator if

67
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,640
it was present or an empty string if it wasn't and corresponding our partition

68
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,760
partitions from the right side instead of from the left side of the string. So

69
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:05,120
using partition instead of split gives you more predictable data results and

70
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,680
you don't have to write as much inference code to figure out what it was

71
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:16,080
you're actually working with. The last one is logging string values and here we

72
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,840
have an F string which is I have no such value key. In this case the first

73
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:29,280
example aabcc we get a message no such value aabcc the second one our log just

74
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,960
shows no such value aabcc it's a little hard to see that there's actually a

75
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,200
leading space on that that key value and it may be that that leading leading

76
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,560
space is why it wasn't found in the database or in the source. The third

77
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,880
case is one that I've seen happen in a couple of companies already where data

78
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,640
that was originally passed through as aabcc was colorized by somebody who

79
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,680
thought oh it will look prettier if I colorize this and so now I've got an

80
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,960
escape sequence but I don't see that here because I've only printed it as the

81
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,960
string value. If instead I log the repr of that value I get a couple of things

82
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,640
one is I'll get surrounding quotes around the value and I'll also expand

83
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:19,280
control characters to be more visible and interpretable so I don't have to

84
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:28,240
guess why is it in red or why is the red value not matched. So repr is the log

85
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,800
string values oh and by the way you should double and triple check your

86
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,080
messages in your accept handlers because a lot of times you know those

87
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:47,640
don't get logged until the exception happens. Five minutes. Okay. Thank you Paul.

88
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:57,800
I have one more slide which you're gonna want to see. Wow ah yeah. So this didn't

89
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,920
realize I was going to go over though. As one of the authors in Python in a

90
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,040
nutshell O'Reilly has given us a discount code and I have cards that you

91
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,000
can get have these codes on as well but from Google Play you get 40% off the

92
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
online version of Python in a nutshell. All right thank you. Y'all scan fast or

93
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,400
see Paul after. Thank you Paul. That was awesome. The title of this is using a

94
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,760
large language model with your data retrieval augmented generation

95
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,000
RAG in five minutes. I don't think I could read that title in five minutes

96
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,040
Will. Okay how do I get the right screen here? You may have to set it to mirror

97
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,320
where you can drag it over either one.

98
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:46,040
Good. Oh I can see it down here. Okay. All right let's go Will. Okay I have five

99
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,320
minutes so I told you the title my name is William Horton I'm a staff MLE it

100
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,600
included health you can find me on Twitter so I'm gonna teach you about

101
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,480
retrieval augmented generation RAG it's a very hot topic my goal by the end of

102
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,760
this five minutes is to make you all sound like geniuses because I'm telling

103
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,880
you all your bosses are talking about RAG if they're talking about AI and it's

104
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,120
actually a somewhat simple concept so I'm gonna show you okay so I'm using the

105
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,640
Python SDK from open AI specifically chat completions there's two main

106
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,960
parameters I set my model and then I send this message so my role is user and

107
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:26,600
I have content it responds to me messages is a list so it can contain

108
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,840
your whole history so I put the models response into the list I add a second

109
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,360
message I continue the conversation I got a not that funny joke they're still

110
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,680
working on that part of AI anyway that's just to show you the tools that's not

111
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,480
the content so I've written a simple function wrapping that to be able to

112
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,280
send one user message to the LLM so LLMs know a lot they know some geography they

113
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:57,760
know math maybe they know language and they know history this is what we would

114
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,720
call world knowledge it's knowledge that's been baked into the model

115
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,200
through training but they don't always know what we want them to know what day

116
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,560
is it today I'm sorry I can't provide that okay thanks GPT what is my job

117
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,440
title that would be useful at work they don't know who is speaking at PyTexas

118
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,320
2024 does it know now I can tell you it does not know it has no idea so there's

119
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,040
some good news this is what rag is about you can actually just add to the

120
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,960
knowledge by telling them a new things yeah it really is that simple people

121
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,360
ask me if they can train or fine-tune models using their own data and the

122
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,400
secret is that in today's paradigm with these super large models people aren't

123
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,920
often retraining what they're doing is just passing more information to the

124
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,840
model in the prompt especially in the system prompt which is special

125
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:51,240
instructions that you can give to the model so revisiting the questions above

126
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,680
but with the necessary context so here you can see I'm sending a system message

127
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,480
and I'm actually telling the model the current time is whatever the current

128
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,080
time is when I run this and the model will actually be able to answer it now

129
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:12,160
tells me it's oh Friday that's actually interesting I did not vet that that's

130
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,840
called a hallucination everybody but it knows that it's April 20th that one I

131
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,480
did not catch in prep okay so I've written a second function here in

132
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,840
iteration of my call LLM where I can now pass in a system prompt this will give

133
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,520
the context of the model so if I tell it my name is William Horton and I'm a

134
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,800
staff Emily blah blah blah and then I ask it what is my job title it knows and

135
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,840
that might seem very silly but I actually use this to work all the time I

136
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,680
tell it what my job is and then I ask it to read a document and it can use that

137
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,360
context that you've told it to inform how it responds here's another one I

138
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,480
downloaded the HTML for the talk schedule it's about 35 hundred thirty

139
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,000
five thousand characters it looks like that it's all HTML now I ask you who's

140
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,600
speaking it's gonna take some time on that so I'm gonna move on and come back

141
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,440
so rag really what it gets at is what if we have many documents so I gave it HTML

142
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,760
but what if it was multiple documents well I want to get the documents that are

143
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:24,920
relevant to my query okay so that worked this I want to delete yeah here we go I

144
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,880
already created some docs there were all the presentation information they look

145
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:37,080
like this they're stringify JSON one for each talk I'm gonna turn them into

146
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,880
embeddings if you don't know what embeddings are I'm not gonna be able to

147
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,000
cover that in the talk let's just say they capture something about the

148
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,120
semantic similarity of these strings so each embedding for each talk description

149
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,280
will help me figure out how similar it is there's the embeddings they're just a

150
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:57,240
bunch of numbers go go go go I'm down to less than a minute okay I'm just gonna

151
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,960
prove that the model does not know this it would be cool if it did but I'm sorry

152
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,440
Andy Python conference famous does not get you into the knowledge of DPT

153
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,080
apparently okay but I can create an embedding for my query now if I have a

154
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,760
query embedding and my document embeddings although you find the most

155
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,520
similar documents using some cool numpy these are the indexes of the documents

156
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,480
that are most similar how many documents should I get I chose three models can

157
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,080
ignore irrelevant stuff so I get my context it's a bunch of strings and you

158
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,840
can see at the top is the actual relevant one about Andy now I call it

159
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,760
again and it knows that Andy works at Bloomberg that is rag in five minutes it

160
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,960
does not work with the wrong documents you can do you can factor it into a

161
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,000
function all the code I just wrote fits in 17 lines and if you don't want to

162
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,400
write it you use something like LOM index as a framework find me on Twitter

163
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,200
on github I'll post this stuff now you can go back and sound like a genius just

164
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:09,080
say rag awesome thank you al swagger ladies gentlemen all right hello hello

165
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,560
okay so for the blast two months I've been in Brooklyn attending the recurse

166
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,320
center what is the recurse center oh wow okay people have heard of this yeah how

167
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,560
I describe it it's sort of like an artist retreat but for software

168
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,880
developers and it's great you go there and you're working on a software project

169
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,480
of your own but you're also surrounded by a bunch of other people who are smart

170
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,520
and motivated and also working on projects of their own they also have a

171
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,360
remote option as well so you don't actually have to go all the way to

172
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,640
Brooklyn I encourage everyone to just kind of check it out it's it's I mean it

173
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,720
sounds sort of weird for me to say it's life-changing but I've definitely

174
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,960
become one of those people who now talks about the recurse center and encourages

175
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:02,120
everyone to apply which is how I got sucked into it so it's not a cult but so

176
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:08,160
the recurse center has a code of conduct of course but one thing that I found

177
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,400
really interesting was it also has four social rules and these are rules that

178
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,120
unlike the code of conduct they actually kind of expect that from time

179
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,280
to time you're going to accidentally break these rules it's these rules are

180
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,480
really great it's giving me this language to talk about things that I've

181
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,840
noticed before in in social situations but I didn't really know how to describe

182
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,440
so here's the here's the four rules the first one is no well actuallys this is

183
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,280
probably one that people can understand it's basically when somebody makes a

184
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,200
statement and then somebody else butts in says well actually with something

185
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,680
that's you know it might be technically correct but it's not really relevant and

186
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,440
it kind of just derails the entire conversation so in these cases right

187
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,160
here it's like hey I just installed Linux on my computer and then somebody

188
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:07,640
else says it's like okay yes you know thank you for that information but it

189
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,760
kind of just like disrupts the whole thing and this sort of thing again it's

190
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,480
it's not a big deal is this is you know from time to time we'll all do this

191
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,480
because we're all excited about the knowledge that we have and we want to

192
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,760
share this knowledge including correcting other people but it is like

193
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,760
this kind of like tiny death by a thousand paper cuts thing and so

194
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,960
basically somebody can then say like oh well hey you're doing the well actually

195
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,240
thing and you can say oh sorry yeah I didn't mean to do that the next one no

196
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,600
feigning surprise this is a big one I was once at a monthly tech meetup and we

197
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,840
were talking about the x11 window system for Linux hands up if you know what the

198
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,880
x11 window system is okay and now hand up if you've never heard of this before

199
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,880
right some of you have some of you haven't there was one person who just

200
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,000
said like oh yeah what is that and the other person who was talking to him said

201
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,520
you've never heard of that and I want to say like it really doesn't take much to

202
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,040
make a person feel unwelcome at a space especially when they're at a technical

203
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,960
conference or some meetup and they're already really afraid that they don't

204
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,400
know enough or they're not they're somehow like not qualified and it can be

205
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,840
really just little comments like this like feigning surprise that can really

206
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,000
just drive people away actually there's there's a lot to do in life and there's

207
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,840
you know there's more to life than Python people can just say like well

208
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,200
maybe tech isn't for me and I'll just do something else with my life so no

209
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,320
feigning surprise no backseat driving that's another one this is where you

210
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,680
have added information but you're not really part of a conversation you just

211
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,600
kind of like throw this little tidbit into the discussion and again it derails

212
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:55,100
and disrupts the conversation okay I'm running out of time no subtle isms okay

213
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,960
so things like harassment and discrimination those are covered by the

214
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,280
code of conduct codes of conduct are not optional the social rules though

215
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,880
these are things where like yeah from time to time unfortunately we might

216
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,520
break some of these rules so the example here is oh Windows is hard to use is

217
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,740
like no Windows is easy my mom can use this and that's like oh that's like the

218
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:23,160
subtle racism sexism ageism these things that can also make people feel

219
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:30,280
incredibly unwelcome so no subtle isms and you know there's a lot of like room

220
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,280
for for judgment calls on what technically counts as a violation of

221
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:40,520
this but the general idea is that you want to make a space where people feel

222
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,760
welcome where they're not going to be I don't know psychological safety I feel

223
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,200
is the the main word for this it's really important to have in

224
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,200
organizations you want to be able to tell bad news to your boss you want to

225
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,720
be able to view your co-workers as people you're cooperating with rather

226
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,560
than competing against you want everyone to feel like they can contribute without

227
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,480
being negatively impacted anyway I'm running out of time so Google this the

228
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,520
four social rules at the recurse Center thank you very much

229
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,760
nicely done all right hello everybody my name is Peter and this talk is called so

230
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,120
you want to give a talk five ways to keep your audience off their phones you

231
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,840
might have seen me up here just about four hours ago this is what it looked

232
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,000
like if you remember me hi again I'm gonna talk about five rules up top here

233
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,680
the first one is be engaging then the second one is be loud third one is be

234
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,320
big fourth one is be prepared and the last one is be considerate I only have

235
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,380
five minutes I'm gonna rush through but all five of these you can remember with

236
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:49,820
this handy acronym just a little bit okay all right let's start at number one

237
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:55,700
be engaging so this is all about making sure that your audience is on board with

238
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,540
your talk you start by introducing yourself then you start by introducing

239
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,100
your topic after that which I just did then you get to the point which

240
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,140
hopefully I'm doing right now the point about all of this is that your audience

241
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,220
is going to quickly lose attention if you you know go off on a tangent or start

242
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,900
to fiddle with your laptop a little bit or you're not really sure what's going

243
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:19,140
on there when you are telling your story it's really handy to use a very classic

244
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,620
story structure like this you can start with exposition here's the problem I

245
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,620
want to solve here's the rising action here's all the interesting stuff you

246
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,460
want to know about here's the climax here's the falling action here's the

247
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,940
resolution it's all just telling a story but make your audience familiar with the

248
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,700
problem before showing them the solution don't start with how you solve the

249
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,180
problem before they even understand why they care another thing that I used to

250
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,940
be engaging I use presentation software like keynote that's my favorite I use

251
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,820
this all the time I'm using it right now and I use a concept called object

252
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,380
constancy which you just saw there I'll do it again because it's really cool

253
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,780
you do transitions and all this kind of stuff you add more things to the slide

254
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,460
and then as things move around on the slide you make sure that they stay

255
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,700
visible you never fade something out and fade it back in you never put it off the

256
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,860
screen and then pop it back on and that animation seems like it's just sugar on

257
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,300
top but it's really handy to help your eye track that and keep keep it in view

258
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,020
I use this feature called magic move to do that it's built into keynote you

259
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,780
should use it it's really easy and also speaking of transitions even obnoxious

260
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,740
transitions can be useful for dramatic effect if you really want to make a

261
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,420
point use something really really visually catchy to get people's

262
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,660
attention speaking of getting people's attention be loud I'm currently speaking

263
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:37,100
into this nifty device called a microphone it looks like this it's got a

264
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,660
couple parts to it it's got a pop filter on top you can hear that because I can

265
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,340
pop the filter by by really doing that with my mouth it's got a capsule

266
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,860
underneath which is picking up my my voice and actually transmitting it to

267
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,420
the speakers and it's got a body that you hold on to there's a couple ways you

268
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,760
can use a microphone you can speak directly into it like this and you can

269
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,340
hear that's very loud very clear I hope at the back you can hear that maybe

270
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:04,380
excellent so I would say this is a good way to use a microphone you can also use

271
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,260
it like this vertically underneath your mouth that's okay too however there is a

272
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:15,500
slight downside here if I exhale with my nose you can hear that so holding it

273
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,580
horizontally kind of avoids that problem what I would not recommend is doing this

274
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:27,140
or doing this doesn't really work that well even having it up here and then you

275
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,420
know kind of speaking off to the side you need to be right on it people say

276
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,220
that they eat the mic sometimes and that's not a misnomer you can get really

277
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,900
up close there and it sounds loud and clear okay one other thing I want to

278
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,300
talk about is being big what I mean by that well that text is big all text on

279
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:49,420
slides that I put up must be at least 60 points in size that text is 60 points

280
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:54,700
it's pretty easy to read I hope but at the back if you've got I don't know not

281
00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:00,100
the best vision like I do that's hard for me to see so 120 points is also pretty

282
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,220
good usually I go as big as I can this text is 240 points that's even better

283
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,860
make it as big as possible don't waste a single pixel on your slides you've got

284
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,660
extra space there why would you waste it the bigger you can go the more people

285
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,780
that can actually read your content also don't show me the window chrome if you

286
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,260
can please there's no need to have all of that extra space there I don't need

287
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,380
to see the other slides are coming up next that will distract me also sometimes

288
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,780
it's very useful to not show anything at all right if I'm talking to you and I

289
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,700
really want to engage with you and tell a little bit of story there's nothing I

290
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,140
need to show on the screen there's nothing you want to read at the same

291
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,020
time I'm not gonna hold the last slide up there that's not very useful I hope

292
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,020
you're listening to the words I'm saying right now instead of being distracted by

293
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,620
the last slide that was on the screen and also side note don't forget to turn

294
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:53,340
off notifications very very important I've got 30 seconds left so I also want

295
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,140
to say be prepared run your talk over and over and over again I ran this just

296
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,580
sitting there probably three or four times before giving this just now if

297
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,300
you're doing a live demo that is presenting on hard mode just fake it

298
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:11,220
this looks like it's real it's not it's part of keynote to gotcha and finally be

299
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,020
considerate of your audience's time one second of time wasted times 60 audience

300
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:20,940
members is wasted blah blah blah blah blah you don't want to waste people's

301
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:26,940
time so that's all I've got be engaging be loud be big be prepared to be

302
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,140
considerate wait wait wait before you drop before you drop the mic confirm

303
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:37,420
something for the audience we have not spoken before this no we have not

304
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:44,900
spoken before this no okay keep that in mind before Josh starts all of you laugh

305
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:51,820
I do want to say Raghu and Aaron if y'all want to see already next okay okay

306
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,180
that if you haven't seen enough of this guy yet you're gonna see more of them

307
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,180
you're gonna see more of it I'm gonna do my best to gesticulate wildly okay five

308
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,460
quick short tips for presenting your ideas which I give to like interns and

309
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,820
stuff like that all the time well number one tell a story stories have a

310
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:13,300
beginning in a middle in an end so stick to a story have a narrative have a path

311
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:19,540
that you're taking the users on tip number two is find your signposts take

312
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:24,300
your story split it up into parts those signposts are the the spaces between the

313
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:30,980
different parts those are time for you to stop and if you're doing a more

314
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,780
interactive presentation it's time to take questions from the audience but

315
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:39,020
either way it gives you a distinct section so you can kind of gauge the

316
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,620
room and figure out where you want to go next tip number three practice practice

317
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,900
practice practice your presentation multiple times know where your signposts

318
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,340
are know about how long it takes for each of the different sections know

319
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,180
which sections you can skip if you're running out of time know which sections

320
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:58,780
you can skip if you're losing the audience number four energy you give is

321
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,860
the energy you get if you don't sound excited about your topic the audience

322
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,700
won't be excited about your topic so if you're excited about something feel free

323
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,380
to just healing wildly I'm really excited about this library that I'm

324
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,300
talking about yay it gives the audience permission to be excited just like you

325
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,740
are and the fifth tip is expects and prepare for the unexpected especially if

326
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,020
you're doing a live demo the live demo gods are fickle and we never sacrifice

327
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:29,380
enough USB drives to make them happy so make sure that you have backup plans if

328
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,420
the internet's out if the projector doesn't work you should be able to

329
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:38,500
interpretive dance your presentation if that's all you have available and there

330
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,620
you go mercifully short

331
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:50,380
hello everyone yep yeah I'm Raghu I'm a mechanical engineering background and I

332
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:56,380
just wanted to introduce panel a dashboarding library in Python so why

333
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:01,420
panel or why interactive visualization so I got into Python mainly because of

334
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:07,700
like the interactive aspect of visualizations in general mainly because

335
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,900
like if you want to describe complex systems it's very tough for the end user

336
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,460
to understand what is the underlying physics behind the system so what we do

337
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:24,580
is like try to build interactive web applications so the end user can toggle

338
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,780
various aspects of the widgets and try to understand the system so later you I

339
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,780
will show some examples and you can understand and why you would like to

340
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:41,820
explore panel is like I think how many of you use matplotlib and you understand

341
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,380
like matplotlib is not interactive in nature but by using panel you can make

342
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:52,740
your matplotlib plots interactive and within panel you can basically build

343
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:58,860
plots in bokeh matplotlib plotly or seaborn alter and combine everything

344
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:07,020
into one so here for example is like a k-means cluster and you can see like you

345
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:12,340
can interact with the features and change the number of clusters and

346
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:18,740
interactively see how the system works and panel also interacts with chatbots

347
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:24,620
for example like an end user does not need to know Python at all and he can

348
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:33,700
basically talk to a chatbot and build plots so he can also he or she can also

349
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:42,380
like ask the plots to be changed from matplotlib to bokeh or plotly or any

350
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:53,660
backend can be switched easily so how do I use it in my work so I work for

351
00:28:53,660 --> 00:29:00,140
pattern Miller it basically is our main background is in motorsports and we have

352
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:04,340
driver in the loop simulator it's basically a million dollar video game

353
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:13,140
and what we are trying to do is like describe the vehicle how the the vehicle

354
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:18,820
physics which runs on this particular hardware and what we are trying to do is

355
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:25,380
understand like develop testing which basically is easy for the end user or

356
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:31,700
our simulation engineers to see what is working what is not working so one

357
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:38,660
implementation in bouquet is a static HTML report which is generated to

358
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:43,660
compare like if any developer makes any change he can quickly understand like

359
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:49,980
what is going wrong in which aspect of the model so it basically generates a

360
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:56,900
report comparing signals with related to the develop branch or the production

361
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:04,580
branch and you can generate interactive plots in static HTML and try to see like

362
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:09,500
where there is generated one other implementation which we have implemented

363
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:16,260
is in the stem education so this is actually being used in chemical

364
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:22,020
engineering curriculum at Lehigh University and this is the basically

365
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,820
assignments for students to understand chemical engineering so I I get

366
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:32,780
like you need to communicate physics or engineering education in different ways

367
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:37,500
for different folks so that they can get a better idea of what is going on so

368
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:44,660
here this is like a sequential reaction of A going to B going to C and a student

369
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:49,020
can basically so I need to refresh

370
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:58,380
so yeah so a student can play with the parameters and a professor or faculty

371
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:04,940
can design assignments basically to get students to understand like how the

372
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:11,540
system behaves so we have many examples of different simulations so we have like

373
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:17,820
infectious disease model which was motivated by COVID and they can

374
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,780
understand like underlying epidemiological models and we have

375
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,140
data science digital lab twin model and one of the other thing is like this one

376
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:32,900
is how to build a zero energy cool cooling chamber so without access to

377
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:38,300
electricity how you can preserve food for a longer time and this one is

378
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:52,180
teaches physics and so basically you can basically all right here we go okay

379
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:57,740
hi guys my name is Erin I'm currently a master's student at UT Austin studying

380
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:07,540
data science before thank you before becoming a full-time student I was

381
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:13,300
working at tax act which is turbo tax adjacent we all just filed our taxes

382
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:19,980
recently so I'm sure we know what that is but I was noticing that with a lot of

383
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,580
business processes we would build models and then have to integrate them and

384
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:30,420
retrain a lot of models and so when I took reinforcement learning I noticed

385
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:35,660
that this type of learning is much more seamless with what businesses tend to do

386
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,940
and I kind of wondered why more businesses didn't do it I think it's

387
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:45,060
just novel people aren't as familiar with it actually out of curiosity raise

388
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:50,460
of hands how many people know what reinforcement learning is okay there you

389
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,060
go so more people than I thought I'm just to intro for those that don't

390
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:58,660
raise their hand it's generally considered the third paradigm of machine

391
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:03,660
learning so along with unsupervised supervised learning it's kind of the

392
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:09,340
third type of learning it's generally made up of so what I have on the screen

393
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:16,580
this is a article I wrote on a hands-on project I did with implementing an RL

394
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:23,180
system and optimizing customer engagement with an online tax filing

395
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:29,460
system so the way I structured the problem and the way most reinforcement

396
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:34,060
learning problems are structured you have an environment which in this case

397
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:40,060
is our online tax filing system then you have a reward which you create and you

398
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:47,060
create this reward so that an agent will is incentivized to do the thing you want

399
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:51,540
it to do so in this case we want to keep customers from leaving our website and

400
00:33:52,340 --> 00:34:02,500
you have states actions and then okay there we go you have your agent which I

401
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:09,420
mentioned previously so those are your four or five main parts of your RL

402
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:17,900
system so with this system the actions I used were recommending an upgrade to

403
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:23,420
your customer when they seem frustrated or pausing having targeted incentives

404
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:29,620
like offering discounts having a chat pop up with personalized recommendations

405
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:34,900
and then progress tracking which TurboTax uses and it has proved to be

406
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,780
helpful with customers when they know this isn't gonna take forever it's gonna

407
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:47,820
take two hours that's very motivating so next looking at algorithms that you

408
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,140
can use I think if you know reinforcement learning you might have

409
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,860
heard of Q learning it's kind of the most popular reinforcement learning

410
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:59,540
system or algorithm out there so that is a type of temporal difference learning

411
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:05,660
the other major type of temporal difference algorithm is Sarsa so the

412
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:11,580
difference between those two Q learning is off policy and Sarsa is on policy and

413
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:20,020
one big recommendation our professor made was that Q learning can be very

414
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:25,580
aggressive because it's off policy whereas Sarsa can tends to find a more

415
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:31,420
safe policy and what I mean by that is with this system we start from a place

416
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,980
where we take no action and then we're moving towards taking more and more

417
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:43,140
action you find that as you interact more with the customer they tend to like

418
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,660
that support and want to stay but as you can imagine with a more aggressive

419
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,820
algorithm if you're constantly getting pop-ups and recommendations it can kind

420
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:57,060
of get annoying so you have to be careful with that for that reason I opted

421
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:09,140
for Sarsa oops and I opted for the temporal difference lambda algorithm

422
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:17,780
which layers on eligibility traces with Sarsa so I kind of explain all the

423
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:22,300
intricacies of why I chose all these algorithms later on if you're interested

424
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:29,940
this article is on my medium blog but the takeaway what we end up doing here

425
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:37,060
and like 50 lines of code we're able to automate finding the best action for a

426
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:41,780
user given a certain state that's what these temporal difference algorithms do

427
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:51,020
they find the most valuable state action pair and you're able to use this system

428
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:58,580
to learn dynamically and five recommend the best state action pair so there you

429
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:02,660
go
