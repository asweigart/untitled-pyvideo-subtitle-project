1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
So I was a Lotus Notes developer in the beginning.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,000
Please don't hold that against me.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,360
And then I went to SharePoint.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,080
So I've kind of been a GUI guy.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,960
And when I got into Python, it really wasn't that great of a

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,120
GUI thing.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,840
But I found something a couple weeks ago that I'm just

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,080
really excited about.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,520
So there's a library out there called Flat.

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't know if you've ever heard of it.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,640
I've Googled it on YouTube.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,840
And there's like five videos on it.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,800
But it's really cool.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,040
And I'll get more into that after I show the demo.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,880
So basically, you import Flat.

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,920
And I'm doing it with the Pandas database, because

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,360
that's what I do in my job.

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,520
So I'm grabbing this Pandas database.

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,880
And then from the data frame, I'm getting the headers from

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,320
the columns here.

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,880
And then for the rows, I set up a list.

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,520
And then I loop through the rows in the data frame and

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,960
fill in the list.

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:20,520
And then I start the main method.

25
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,320
And this is a Flat data table.

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,720
And so I set the columns to the headers from up above and

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,520
the rows from the data frame.

28
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,200
This is the hard part that I've been working on, is

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,440
getting it to scroll.

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:49,080
So basically, I take on the data table the last column.

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,760
I make it scrollable.

32
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,600
And then I take that column and I add it to the row, which

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,200
is another control within Flat.

34
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,840
And I make it scrollable so I can scroll the whole nine

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,760
yards.

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,720
Then I add them to the page.

37
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:17,360
And so from there, all I've got to do is run this, and

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,280
boom.

39
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,520
You have a GUI.

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:33,400
And if I collapse that, I can scroll across vertically.

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,000
So anyway, I did this because I work with this stuff.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,120
And I have people that all the time, they just, David, give

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,560
me my data.

44
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,680
And so what I really wanted to do was just build a GUI that

45
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,560
I could give to them with an easy button on it and says,

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,920
get me my data.

47
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,960
And it would just automatically download the data.

48
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,400
And they wouldn't be calling me up all day long.

49
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,720
So this is just one thing.

50
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,960
And now we'll go to the rest of it.

51
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,840
So this is all built on Flutter.

52
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,440
How many people know what Flutter is?

53
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,200
Flutter is a cross-platform language built on Dart that

54
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,600
Google built for mobile development.

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,880
And so you're probably saying to yourself, but David, we

56
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,760
only use the web.

57
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,720
Same code base.

58
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,280
I didn't change anything here.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,920
Same thing.

60
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,160
On the web.

61
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,720
But wait, there's more.

62
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,520
So we come over here to the docs,

63
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,440
publishing your flood app.

64
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,240
You can publish with the same exact code base to Android,

65
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,480
iOS, Mac, Linux, Windows, and the web.

66
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,040
With the same code base.

67
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,280
Not any changes.

68
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,320
I don't know about you guys, but that impresses

69
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,120
the heck out of me.

70
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,360
I think it's really cool.

71
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,120
I've done this.

72
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Let me show you this real quick.

73
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,400
I think I got 23 seconds.

74
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:49,800
This is a native Mac OS app that I built and compiled into

75
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,880
native Mac code with the Flutter, or the Flet library.

76
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,120
And you can just.

77
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,480
So I mean, in five minutes.

78
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,720
That's awesome, David.

79
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,520
Now I need to figure out what I can make.

80
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,360
That's pretty cool.

81
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,240
All of that from one code base.

82
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
Very cool.

83
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,280
Awesome.

84
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,280
All right, we're going to get Bo McDermott set up on the

85
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,040
stage here.

86
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,760
Do you need to plug in, or are you just talking?

87
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,320
Just a brief moment for tech set up.

88
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,360
Who has a computer and phone in front of them or in their

89
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,080
hand, raise your hand.

90
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,560
Raise your hand.

91
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,320
OK, if you could pull up the standard library reference,

92
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,840
Python standard library reference.

93
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,080
You can Google that.

94
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,200
And then we'll wait while the rest of my tech set up happens.

95
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,440
Thank you.

96
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,800
You've been patient.

97
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,520
All right, we can begin.

98
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,840
Let's go, George.

99
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,720
I'm Troy McClure.

100
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,520
You may remember me from such films as Python, Strings on a

101
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,720
Plane, The Iterator, Iterator 2, Datetime.day, Method Max,

102
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,920
Dunderdome.

103
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,120
And now I welcome you to my new talk, Python Documentation,

104
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,520
An Actor's Guide to Getting Off Book.

105
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,360
My name's Bo McDermott.

106
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,680
I'm not.

107
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,360
Troy McClure.

108
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,760
Oh, I wish I were Phil Hartman.

109
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,600
He's cool.

110
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,760
20 years ago, I was a huge computer nerd.

111
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,160
I did like a year and a half of CCNA and CCNP and college and

112
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,920
all this stuff.

113
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,560
And then I didn't want a desk job, so I went and did other

114
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,600
stuff.

115
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,440
And then I've been living my life.

116
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,640
And then a couple years ago, third of the company got laid

117
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
off that I really liked, and I was one of them.

118
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,480
And then two weeks later, one of my best friends of all time

119
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,560
died very tragically.

120
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,160
And I was like, huh.

121
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,720
And so I did a lot of life rethinking.

122
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,560
And I found myself last year just diving into code.

123
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,840
It's my first time to ever pick up Python or any programming

124
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,320
language, aside from HTML in the 90s or Cisco switches.

125
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,920
But my son here, he's 12.

126
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,960
He's been block coding since he's eight.

127
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,920
Block coding.

128
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,960
Clap.

129
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,840
Clap.

130
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Very impressive.

131
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,440
So it's been a bonding experience for me diving into

132
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:28,920
the code.

133
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,080
I don't have programming friends, so I do it the old

134
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,240
way.

135
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,120
I'm also an actor.

136
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,840
So I took it the actor's approach, where you memorize

137
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,640
your script, which seems kind of crazy because it's like

138
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,520
encyclopedias for Python if you've looked at all the

139
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,400
documentation.

140
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,800
But why does an actor memorize a script?

141
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,400
It's not to get hired.

142
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,960
After all, that doesn't make you any good at acting.

143
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,800
They memorize, the best ones that I know, because once you

144
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,440
have it in your mind and body, the material, you can play.

145
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,080
So I figured, why not?

146
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,800
That's what I'll do.

147
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,880
If you have the built-in standard library stand up, I'm

148
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,080
just going to test, because I think I've memorized

149
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,040
everything from the built-in functions part.

150
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,360
If you look at that introduction there, there's

151
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,200
intro, built-in functions, all the way to the end of

152
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
exceptions.

153
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,280
So I pull up the built-in functions.

154
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,960
And just throw some out, and let's see if I can remember

155
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,560
the arguments, because I did this in December.

156
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,000
I just memorized all this stuff.

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,120
And I just want to see.

158
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,240
Anybody?

159
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,680
Yell at a function.

160
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,920
Enumerate.

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,200
Let's see, it ends with the flags equals zero, right?

162
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,080
Or the steps equals zero.

163
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,920
And it starts with a, is it iterable?

164
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,040
OK.

165
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,600
Anything else?

166
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,160
What else?

167
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,320
Come on, you people.

168
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,960
Filter.

169
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,200
Let's see if I can do filter.

170
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,600
Yes.

171
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,880
No, I've forgotten filter, because it ends in what?

172
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,360
Value?

173
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,480
No, I don't remember.

174
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,240
I know that I memorized what?

175
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,000
Range.

176
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,360
Multiple variations for range.

177
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,000
You give it the, so I'm putting myself on the spot.

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,600
Start, stop.

179
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,720
You give it the number.

180
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,880
Start.

181
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,920
Stop.

182
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,480
Well, anyway, I'm on the spot here.

183
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,040
So instead, I'll just do this.

184
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,840
Abs-all, any, callable, bool, divmod, sum, pow.

185
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,320
Those are the logical, mathematical, bytes, numeric.

186
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,040
They're all just sort of sitting in there.

187
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,560
Functions, iterators, generators, all these things

188
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,520
is the documentation memorized.

189
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,000
If you were to go into, say, the functions section,

190
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,440
or the iterator section, how I memorized those

191
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,800
was not by really understanding them, but by memorizing

192
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,520
the pictures, just the imagery of the words.

193
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,480
So I'm just going to show you how,

194
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,280
if you want to learn a new module, or the way

195
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,200
that I learn a module, you just pick, read the docs,

196
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,080
pick five things that you like, five things that

197
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,840
are really important to you.

198
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,280
And then walk around a room or town and point.

199
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,480
For abs, pick a really stimulating image.

200
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,960
Somebody really, really sexy is working out

201
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,920
without their shirt on.

202
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,240
They've got their abs, and they're doing their abs things.

203
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,680
It's got a little x on there, so they got a tattoo of an x.

204
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,600
And remember, for iterators, I use a cow.

205
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,400
It's a bull.

206
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,760
For an iterable, it's an utters and bull.

207
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,840
And for iterators, it's actually like the Terminator,

208
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,720
but it's a cow.

209
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,560
My whole point is that if you have just a couple images,

210
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,640
you have an index of terms.

211
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,040
And then you have a checklist.

212
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,000
And that's all I do.

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,200
I just have a checklist of terms that I go through.

214
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,600
And I'm not really worried about speed,

215
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,880
because I'm sitting in the middle of this.

216
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,000
Five minutes.

217
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,240
But that's how you do it.

218
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,080
All right.

219
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,200
Thank you, Bo.

220
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,600
All right.

221
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Thank you, Bo.

222
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,000
All right.

223
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,640
Go ahead and get set up up there, Walker.

224
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,140
Yeah?

225
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,020
All right.

226
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,500
I will hand this off for something more exciting to Walker

227
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Hale and automatically running tests.

228
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,140
OK.

229
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,860
Eating the mic.

230
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,380
Yeah.

231
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,300
So there's the title slide.

232
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,100
And there.

233
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,100
OK.

234
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,460
So this is my motivation.

235
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,300
I'm telling a story.

236
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,620
I want to run linters, formatters, tests, et cetera.

237
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,140
All of that.

238
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,740
I want to run all the things.

239
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:50,740
And I want to run them whenever I make any change.

240
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,500
OK.

241
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,340
I don't want to rely on continuous integration,

242
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,820
because that means I've got to wait till I push a branch.

243
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,980
Who's got time for that?

244
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,140
I don't want to just rely on a pre-commit hook.

245
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,420
I've got to actually get add and get commit just to run.

246
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:06,980
No.

247
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,020
No.

248
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,100
I'm too old.

249
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,020
I don't want to touch the mouse.

250
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,500
I'm running out of time.

251
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,060
I want to just, and I want to be able to easily change things.

252
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,660
I want to be able to change my mind about what tests I want

253
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,420
to run, if it's generating some test files in a temporary

254
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,100
directory, and I want to be able to look at a particular

255
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,700
file because something failed.

256
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,340
I want to be able to quickly make changes and see what's

257
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,620
happening, and I want it all now.

258
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,260
Now.

259
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:36,660
OK.

260
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,740
So here's my trick.

261
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,260
OK.

262
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,500
So all of you have already seen your project layouts.

263
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,020
There's a source directory and a test directory, and here's

264
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,140
like a little toy example.

265
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,420
And so yeah, I could just like PyTest, and it's going to run

266
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,140
test my code.

267
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,460
Great.

268
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,740
And there's my module.

269
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,100
So what I do is I just add another directory, and I've

270
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,940
got two files in there.

271
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,620
And one file is the thing I start up at the beginning of

272
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,260
my session.

273
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,980
The other file is going to get run every single time I do

274
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,480
Command-S. Every time I save, that's the trigger to

275
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,640
run everything.

276
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,440
So there's the magic at the top, that first file.

277
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,380
Watch files.

278
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,040
Now that's based on, this is inspired by a previous now

279
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,520
deprecated project called rerun.

280
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,760
And it just will monitor a directory.

281
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,880
Every time it sees a change, it will run the

282
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,240
command you provided.

283
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,480
Of course, you've got to be a little clever, filter out like

284
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,400
PyCache, otherwise it'll go into like an infinite loop.

285
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,360
And so you're a little clever how to do it.

286
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,720
This is not the only tool that does that.

287
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,040
You pick one.

288
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,640
And then you've got this other script.

289
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,560
This is the script that runs every time.

290
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,480
And you make sure that your system is sensitive to that

291
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,320
script, too.

292
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,600
So whenever I make a change to that loop body.sh,

293
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,760
everything reruns.

294
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,160
I say, oh, I want to change my PyTest arguments.

295
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,560
There we go.

296
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,680
It's going to rerun everything all the time, just

297
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,920
because I made a change somewhere.

298
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,200
So this is it running.

299
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:21,280
And if I just go in here, loop body, I don't know, just and

300
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,920
save, it's rerunning.

301
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,440
And I could turn black on, turn black off, whatever.

302
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,640
That's the trick.

303
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,840
Watch files or any competing product, and

304
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,280
it becomes your IDE.

305
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,800
The operating system is now your IDE, and

306
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,640
your trigger is save.

307
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,080
That's it.

308
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,320
All right.

309
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,600
So let's hear from Devin and Max on why you

310
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,840
should do a game jam.

311
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,680
Let's make sure it's on.

312
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,440
Can you hear me?

313
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,160
We can hear you.

314
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,600
Awesome.

315
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:03,960
All right.

316
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,040
Hi, everybody.

317
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,680
Thank you so much for your patience.

318
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,120
My name is Max Logan.

319
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,000
My name is Devin Brainer.

320
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,840
We're friends, if you didn't already know that.

321
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,760
Yep.

322
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,600
And today, we're going to talk about why you

323
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,840
should do a game jam.

324
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,680
So raise your hand if you've ever participated

325
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,360
in a hackathon.

326
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,800
And raise your hand if you know what a hackathon is.

327
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,840
So for anyone who didn't raise their hand, it's basically a

328
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,600
time-constrained event for building a project under a

329
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,000
specific theme.

330
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,440
And that's what a game jam is.

331
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,760
The theme is specifically a game, but they will often have

332
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,720
more specific themes as well.

333
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,440
Last summer, Max and I participated in the Game

334
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,920
Maker's Toolkit game jam, which is a 48-hour jam.

335
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,240
Yeah, and we just want to talk about, first, why we did it.

336
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,680
First off, we love video games.

337
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,040
That's part of what got us into coding in the first place.

338
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,000
And we wanted to make one together.

339
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,400
We were friends for a long time, wanted to get some

340
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,200
extra experience, all that sort of thing.

341
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,080
But we needed a reason to actually

342
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,280
get started on the game.

343
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,600
It's hard to make that first step and just get started on

344
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,520
what you're working on.

345
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,680
And we also needed an idea to get behind.

346
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,160
And fortunately, the theme for the game jam was kind of the

347
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,840
perfect prompt.

348
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,200
Last year's theme was roles reversed, which was very fun.

349
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,360
So during the jam, we faced quite a few challenges, one of

350
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,080
which was we decided that we were going to take this

351
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,680
opportunity to learn a new game engine.

352
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,520
That is the Godot game engine.

353
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,040
It's an open source game engine.

354
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,280
We had never touched it before.

355
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,240
And we thought, well, we'll make a whole game in it in 48

356
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,200
hours, that'll go great.

357
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,880
Time management was difficult.

358
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,280
And scoping was also a challenge.

359
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,720
Coming up with an idea that we could execute within the

360
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,280
time frame and have success with was pretty difficult.

361
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,560
We did our best to plan out our days at the start.

362
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,720
But as it happens, bugs can get in the way.

363
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,240
Also, due to the time constraint, we didn't have a

364
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,000
lot of opportunities for breaks.

365
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,280
And focusing can be difficult under those conditions.

366
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,120
And we got pretty tired at night.

367
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,360
So how'd it go?

368
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,560
Well, I think it actually went pretty well.

369
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,400
Turned out we did actually scope appropriately.

370
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,360
And we made this game, we called it Invasive Species.

371
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,960
Very low art.

372
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,080
We're mainly coders, not artists.

373
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,440
But this game, you act as the weeds on the farm with the goal

374
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,360
of destroying all the crops before the

375
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,640
farmer eradicates you, which we thought was very clever for

376
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,360
the roles reversed theme.

377
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,640
And the reception was surprisingly good.

378
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,080
So these were the results for the game.

379
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,760
We ended up in about the top 11% in terms of enjoyment,

380
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,440
which was our highest stat.

381
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,360
And then, of course, the top 37% in presentation, probably

382
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,680
due to our tutorials.

383
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,320
There were about 6,800 entries about.

384
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,880
So that's our placement under those statistics.

385
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,640
And then just one example of some of the

386
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,880
feedback that we got.

387
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,960
So why should you do one?

388
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,040
Well, we found it pretty rewarding.

389
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,960
It was really fun to build something cool in a short

390
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,280
amount of time.

391
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,240
It was a great opportunity to improve skills.

392
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,520
The constraints of the topic and the time limit force you

393
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,560
to be creative with the skills that you have.

394
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,280
And you have to use them in an interesting way, especially if

395
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,560
you want to get noticed by people reviewing.

396
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,400
It's also really fun at the end of the jam when you are

397
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,120
looking at other submissions.

398
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,960
A lot of the teams came up with some really cool ideas that we

399
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,680
never would have thought of.

400
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,640
There was one that was one of the winners, and it was you're

401
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,200
a dog trying to get pets.

402
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,160
And last, but certainly not least, you can use Python.

403
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,360
You don't have to learn a whole new game engine in two days

404
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:30,920
like we did.

405
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,320
You can just use PyJam, or PyGame, which is an open

406
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,680
source library for multimedia applications,

407
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,640
specifically games.

408
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,240
That's why it's called that.

409
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,560
Yeah, thank you.

410
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,040
That's it.

411
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,280
Thank you guys so much.

412
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,520
All right.
